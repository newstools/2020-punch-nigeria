Johnny Edward Watford, who parade Nigerian duo Isaac Success and Tom Dele-Bashiru, have been relegated from the English Premier League to the English Sky Bet Championship for the first time in five years, The PUNCH reports. They were joined by Bournemouth and Norwich. The Hornets finished 19th after amassing 34 points from 38 games. Watford needed a win against Arsenal in their final league game of the season to avoid relegation but they lost 3-2 away to the Gunners, a result which confirmed their demotion to the English second-tier division for the third time in their history. A brace from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and another strike from Kieran Tierney was enough for Mikel Arteta’s side to see off a comeback from Watford, who scored twice in the second half through Troy Deeney and Danny Welbeck. Watford recorded eight wins all through the season, lost 22 and drew seven games.
Success, who made five EPL appearances this season, all as a substitute (seven in all competitions), missed Watford’s last 13 EPL games due to fitness issues. The 24-year-old, who has three years left on his deal with Watford, moved to Vicarage Road from Spanish side Granada in July 2016 and has since gone on to make 62 appearances for the Hornets, scoring five goals. Success has four caps for Nigeria.
