James Abraham, Jos The Northern Governors Forum has condemned the attack on the convoy of Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State, describing it as callous and reprehensible. Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, in a statement on Friday, said the attack on the convoy of Zulum, who was on his way to Baga, a town in Kukawa Local Government Area to distribute relief materials to internally displaced persons for the Sallah celebrations, was another desperate attempt by criminal elements to sabotage the efforts of the governor towards reducing the suffering of vulnerable people traumatised by terrorists. The statement partly read, “This regrettable attack shows the desperation by enemies of peace and humanity at large to jeopardise all efforts towards making life easier for victims of violence in the State over the years. “The Northern Governors Forum strongly condemns this attack and stands with Governor Zulum who has demonstrated courage in personally reaching out to people in need despite the dangers. We urge him not to deterred as he keeps working with security agencies to protect the lives and properties of the people.” In another development, the Forum has mourned the elder statesman and leader of the Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, Pa Ayorinde Fasanmi. Lalong in a condolence message on behalf of the Forum described the death of the elder statesman as a great loss to the Yoruba people and Nigeria as a whole given his enormous contributions to the political development of the country. Lalong said Pa Fasanmi played an active role in the enthronement of democracy and its sustenance through his roles as a legislator in the first and second Republics where he advocated for good governance, justice, and equity. He condoled with his family, friends, political associates, and followers while praying to God to grant his soul eternal rest.
