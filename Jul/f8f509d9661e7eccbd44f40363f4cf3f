Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, has said the former president Olusegun Obasanjo became Nigeria’s military head of state and later, civilian president, as a result of his humility. Omo-Agege, according to a statement from his media office on Friday, titled, ‘Omo-Agege tasks political leaders on humility’, stated this in Abuja on Thursday. The DSP, the statement added, spoke at the public presentation of a book, ‘How I became a Senator in 30 days’ written by the Chairman, Senate Committee on Rules and Business, Sadiq Umah. Omo-Agege cited the case of Obasanjo, “who rose to become Nigerian leader both in military and civilian administrations by virtue of his humility.” He said, “The biggest attribute that we need to serve, which our upcoming politicians should imbibe, is that of humility. “We have been told of a joke in the past by a former Head-of-State and President. “He told us that people said he was ‘mumu’. ‘Mumu’ is a euphemism for humility. He may not necessarily be the poster child for humility in Nigeria today but he succeeded. “He (Obasanjo) said people said he was ‘Mumu’, yet he became Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters which was the de facto number two position in the country at that time. “They said he was ‘Mumu’, he became head-of-state. They said he was ‘Mumu’ and he became an elected President and was reelected. “That is what our colleague, Chairman Rules and Business, Senator Sadiq Umah represents.” The Delta Central lawmaker said that dedicated service to the people in humility would contribute immensely to putting the nation on a path of progress and prosperity.
