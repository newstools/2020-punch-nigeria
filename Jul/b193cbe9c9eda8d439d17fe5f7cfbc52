John Alechenu, Abuja THE Peoples Democratic Party has rejected the Appeal Court judgement upholding the election of Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello. The party expressed shock that the appellate court discountenanced what it referred to as “hard evidence”, which showed that the PDP candidate, Musa Wada, scored the highest valid votes in the governorship election held on November 16th, 2019. This was contained in a statement titled: “Kogi: PDP Confident of Justice at Supreme Court …Shocked that Appeal Court Discountenanced Hard Evidence,” which was signed and issued by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, on Sunday. According to the PDP, the judgment of the Court of Appeal in favour of Bello does not vitiate or detract from the fact, by hard evidence, that it won the November 16, 2019 Kogi state governorship election. The party noted with shock that the Appeal Court, in its judgment, decided to discount the merit of the evidence before it, which showed that the PDP candidate, Musa Wada, scored the highest valid votes in the said election. It observed that the judgment of the Appeal Court would be a major setback to the country’s democratic process if left unchallenged, but expressed confidence that justice would be served on the merit of the case by the Supreme Court.
