Dele Ogunyemi, Warri THE founder of Victory Revival Fasting and Prayer Ministry, Warri, Delta State, Bishop Elijah Orhonigbe, who was last month remanded in the Nigerian Correctional Service, Warri, by a magistrates’ court for alleged rape, has been granted conditional bail by the state High Court. Orhonigbe was arrested by operatives of the state police command following the report of alleged rape made by a 19-year-old girl against him. The state High Court in Warri, on Wednesday, granted the accused bail. The court, which was presided over by Justice A. O. Akpovi, admitted Orhonigbe to bail with stringent conditions. Justice Akpovi ordered the cleric to provide two sureties with N1m each as part of the bail conditions. The judge also ruled that one of the sureties must be a landed property owner in the Delta South or Central Senatorial District, while the other must be a civil servant above level 12. According to the court, the bail conditions must be perfected before the Assistant Director of Court with the sureties swearing to affidavit of means as well as providing three passport photographs each and means of identification. Another bail condition is that “the applicant shall not conduct any prayer for any female in his office or any closed accommodation henceforth and can only conduct prayers in an open hall with a minimum of one female and one male present, who must be adults.” The court warned Orhonigbe that any breach of the order would lead to the revocation of the bail.
