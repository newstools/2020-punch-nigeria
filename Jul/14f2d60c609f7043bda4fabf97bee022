Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Residents and users of the Ado-Ikare Akoko Road, on Monday heaved a sigh of relief following the completion of the reconstruction and reopening of the Ureje Bridge for users. Work started six weeks ago on the bridge, which was washed off by flood. The bridge, which collapsed during last year’s rainy season and caused the drowning of a commuter, had been a source of concern to residents and users of the road, which leads to the Federal Polytechnic, Ado Ekiti, and the Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, and also links the state with Ondo, Kogi and Kwara states as well as Abuja. The residents, who commended the Federal Government for the reconstruction of the bridge through the Federal Road Maintenance Agency, also lauded Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi; the ABUAD founder, Chief Afe Babalola, SAN; and Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on FERMA, Femi Bamisile, for their intervention. A road user, Yakubu Ibrahim, said, “The reconstruction and reopening of this bridge have put a stop to the problems of traffic snarl, overflowing of the river whenever it rained and taking of motorcycles to this point, walking across and taking another vehicle or motorcycle from the other end to one’s destination.” A trader, Mrs Bimbo Adeyemi, who expressed joy that the work had been completed, said, “We are happy. When schools resume now, we can guarantee timely and safe movement of our children to and from school.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
