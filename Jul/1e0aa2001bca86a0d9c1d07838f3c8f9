Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, on Tuesday, quoted the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as expressing satisfaction with the performance of the interim leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress. Shehu said the President made the remark at a virtual meeting he had with state governors elected on the platform of the party and members of the Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee. The presidential aide disclosed this in a statement titled, ‘President Buhari interacts with APC governors, commends party caretakers’. Adams Oshiomhole was recently suspended as the party’s national chairman. In June, the party’s National Executive Committee met and dissolved the National Working Committee. It then appointed the Yobe State governor and others as the chairman and members of the caretaker committee as well as of the extraordinary National Convention Committee. Shehu said at Tuesday’s virtual interaction with the governors of the APC-controlled states, which had Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo in attendance, Buhari expressed satisfaction with the work that the caretaker committee had been doing. He quoted the President as saying, “I am pleased with the chairman and the work of the committee. He is highly mobile in the efforts to coordinate and strengthen the party. I am happy with his personal efforts.” The statement also quoted Buhari as appreciating the efforts of the APC governors following the successful conduct of the party primaries in Edo and Ondo states.
