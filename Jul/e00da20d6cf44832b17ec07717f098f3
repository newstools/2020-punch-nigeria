Raphael Ede, Enugu The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has said it is working with other geopolitical zones for the realisation of the Nigerian President of Igbo extraction in 2023. The National Publicity Secretary, of the organisation, Uche Achi-Okpaga, said this in an interview with The PUNCH on Wednesday. Speaking about the desire of the Ndi’igbo for a President of Igbo extraction by 2023, he said, “The presidency of Nigeria, no doubt, is not what a particular tribe or geopolitical zone can aspire to get without reaching out to other zones.” Achi-Okpaga further said, “Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide under the leadership of Chief Nnia Nwodo has been able to bridge the supposed gap between the South-East and other geopolitical zones. Since 2017 when the present NEC was inaugurated, we have reached out appreciably. “Today, Ohanaeze, Afenifere, PANDEF and Middle Belt Forum speak with one voice on all contemporary and emerging national issues. In many fora, Ohanaeze has demonstrated her capacity to galvanise these other bodies representing their respective geopolitical zones to reach a consensus.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
