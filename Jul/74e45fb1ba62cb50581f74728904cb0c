Samson Folarin The Lagos State Government on Thursday said it had trained and empowered all residents displaced by a gas explosion in the Abule Egba area of the state. Several people had lost their lives and many displaced after the tragedy, which occurred on January 19, 2020. The Director-General of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, said those affected by the explosion were sheltered in the Igando Relief Camp of the agency. He explained that they later went through a four-week training workshop. The LASEMA boss noted that the training, which was facilitated by the Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation and his team, was part of the process to reintegrate them into the society. Oke-Osanyintolu explained that with relevant skills, the survivors would be able to fend for themselves and support members of their families.
