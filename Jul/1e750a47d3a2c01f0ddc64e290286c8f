The Kogi State Governor spoke shortly after the inauguration of the committee by the Mai Mala Buni-led APC Caretaker Committee at the party’s National Secretariat, in Abuja, on Friday. He said, “I was a contestant myself before. It is not for aspirants to dictate for the party the rules of the game.” The Independent National Electoral Commission had published APC’s choice of indirect primary on its website. Eleven aspirants had in response, demanded that the party use the direct mode which entails all card-carrying members of the party voting to chose the party candidate as against the indirect mode which vests such powers on delegates.
