Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti A lawmaker representing Ekiti State at the National Assembly, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, on Tuesday, urged residents of the state to pray for Governor Kayode Fayemi and some members of his cabinet, who are presently in isolation, for their quick recovery from COVID-19. “Fayemi must have contracted the disease while trying to offer effective leadership for the people of Ekiti State. This has made him worthy of being prayed for by the people while staying in isolation,” Bamidele said. The lawmaker, who represents the Ekiti Central Senatorial District, said in a statement titled: ‘Pray for Fayemi, others’ recovery’, said the fact that Fayemi and the affected cabinet members contracted COVID-19 should convince everybody of the existence of the virus. The lawmaker, who clocks 57 today (Wednesday) said, “We need to all pray for Governor Fayemi and other cabinet members, who had contracted this disease in the course of discharging their services to the people of our dear state. “We can all attest to the virulent actions Governor Fayemi had taken to tame COVID-19 spread in Ekiti. He was one of the first five state chief executives to impose lockdown and ban interstate movement in Ekiti, all in a bid to keep the people safe. “But for the decisive actions taken by Governor Fayemi and the COVID-19 Task Force, the number of victims in Ekiti would have increased geometrically and that is why we should all pray for the governor’s quick recovery for him to return to his duty post.” Copyright PUNCH.
