Enyioha Opara, Minna The Niger State Police Command has handed over 15 children rescued from one Umar Ahmed to the state Child’s Rights Agency pending when investigation would be concluded. The children, who are between the ages of two and 10, were found in dehumanising conditions in the Almajiri school being run by Ahmed, where they were allegedly being tortured on a daily basis by the suspect. The command’s spokesman, Wasiu Abiodun, told our correspondent on Tuesday that the reason why the police left the victims in the hands of the child’s right agency was to take proper care of them. Abiodun stated, “Some of the children have issues with their health and need to be treated in hospitals; they need to be well fed and adequately protected from evil men. “We are doing our best to contact their parents; we are doing this in collaboration with the Child’s Right Agency until investigation is concluded and we will reunite them with their parents.” The PPRO stated that the children were physically abused by the suspect, which left scars all over their bodies, adding that they must be well catered for as “we can’t leave them like that.” Ahmed was apprehended in Anguwan Gwari Suleja on July 18, 2020, around 2pm, by police operatives attached to the ‘A’ Division, Suleja, following a tip-off. Abiodun said the suspect used chains to tie the victims’ legs whenever they disobeyed him or misbehave. He added that investigation was ongoing at the end of which the suspect would be arraigned.
