Kelvin Ekerete Ex-Super Eagles defender, Ifeanyi Udeze, says he was once a victim of football racism while in Europe and insists the scourge will not stop. Udeze, who played most of his career in Greece with Kavala, PAOK and AEK Athens, said he was close to a fight with the fans after he was racially abused. “The most shocking thing for me in football was the day I faced racism in Greece. They were pelting me with coins and bananas and I was really angry. The referee had to halt the game. I pulled my jersey and I almost fought the fans. Any time I remember that day, I feel sad,” Udeze, who also played for West Brom in the English Premier League, stated. The former left-back added, “Racism will still remain no matter what people do. Nothing can be done to take racism out of football. As long as you walk on the streets as a coloured person and you’re still racially abused, then you’ll be racially abused on the pitch and sometimes by your teammates. So, it will be very difficult to take racism out of football,” he told The PUNCH. Players in the English Premier League replaced their names with the inscription ‘Black Lives Matter’ at the resumption of the league, a stand taken by the FA against racism. Copyright PUNCH.
