John Alechenu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has urged relevant security agencies to probe reports linking suspected cybercriminal, Ramon Abbas alias Hushpuppi to top-ranking members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party. APC’s request was contained in a statement signed by its Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, in Abuja, on Saturday. Nabena said, it was instructive to note that the suspect was arrested in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, which was a destination of choice for PDP leaders ahead of the 2019 general elections. The APC statement read in part, “We note that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has already declared the arraigned Instagram celebrity wanted over fraud allegations.

Atiku Abubakar; former Senate President, Bukola Saraki; former Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara; Senator Dino Melaye among other PDP stalwarts. “While relevant authorities investigate the nature of their relationship and business partnership, we also challenge the PDP leadership to do same by opening up on the nature of the relationship, particularly the kind of services the arrested “Hushpuppi” provided them.”
