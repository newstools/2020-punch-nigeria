‘Tosin Oluwalowo Some Nigerians on social media have questioned the exclusion of Super Eagles players from the list of Top 10 Most Valuable Players in Africa. The PUNCH reported on Wednesday that Liverpool duo Mohammed Salah and Sadio Mane, led a list of Africa’s 10 MVPs that had no Nigerian. Both players are each valued at €120m. The closest any Nigeria player got on the list is Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, who is valued at €36m. The list, which was compiled by transfermatkt.com, has two players each from Senegal, Ivory Coast and Morocco. Also in the list are one player each from Egypt, Gabon, Algeria and Ghana. Fans, who reacted to the story, wondered why no Nigeria failed to make the cut. Anas Isah couldn’t believe Victor Osimhen was left out after just being named the best African footballer in France. “I repeat this is unfair. Victor Osimhen is now the best African player in the French league. Wilfred Ndidi is the best defensive midfielder in EPL,” he said. “These guys don’t know what they are talking about, so Osimhen that’s on the verge of moving to the Italian league for about €60m is not good enough to make the list? What about Chukwueze,” Don Pius tweeted. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
