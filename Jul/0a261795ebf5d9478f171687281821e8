Raphael Ede, Enugu Chieftains of the All Progressives Congress in Enugu State have raised concerns over the composition of the selection committee for the Federal Government’s 774,000 Public Works recruitment. The Federal Government had last week announced the composition of committees for the engagement of 1,000 youths per local government area in the country. However, stalwarts of the APC in Enugu, on Sunday petitioned the Minister of Labour, Dr Chris Ngige, and the leadership of the National Assembly, alleged that the state government hijacked the process. The petition was signed by Chief Ben Ezeamuna and Chief Tobi Odinwankpa from Udi and Ezeagu Local Government Areas of the state, respectively. The petition read in part, “As the ruling party in Nigeria, we were perplexed to see that members of our party are conspicuously missing. The list contains only PDP loyalists and members, apart from few inclusions outside party lines. “It is a worrisome development as our party is marginalised and this is an embarrassing development that has plagued APC development in the state.” Reacting to the allegations, the state Commissioner for Labour, Mr. Uchechukwu Ogbonna said, he did not know the identities of the committee members, stressing that no memo had been sent to him from any quarter. He, however, promised to get information on the scheme from the relevant quarters. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
