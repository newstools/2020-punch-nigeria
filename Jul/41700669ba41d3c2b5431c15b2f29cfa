John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party and African Democratic Congress have challenged the Federal Government to come clean over allegations that the N800bn, which it claimed to have recovered, has been re-looted. The PDP, in a press briefing in Abuja on Wednesday, said the level of corruption under the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), -led All Progressives Congress regime was not only shameful but also embarrassing. The PDP said, “We challenge the APC Federal Government to give account of the N800bn, which Lai Mohammed claimed to have recovered, especially given allegations that recovered money has been re-looted and shared among topmost officials of the Buhari administration and APC leaders.” Also, the African Democratic Congress in a statement titled, “ADC asks Lai Mohammed to disclose figure of re-looted funds,”  by its National Publicity Secretary, Yemi Kolapo, demanded that the Buhari-led APC regime “Must as a matter of urgency, disclose the percentage of the recovered N800bn loot that had been re-looted under the current administration.” Copyright PUNCH.
