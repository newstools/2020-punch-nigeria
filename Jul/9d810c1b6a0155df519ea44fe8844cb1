Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The leaders of Fulani communities in Southern Kaduna in Kaduna State, under the aegis of Coalition of Fulani Pastoralists Organisations, have alleged that no fewer than 99 indigenes were killed in the Zango-Kataf and Kaura local government areas of the state last month. They also alleged that some Atyap youths in Atyap and Tsam chiefdoms of Zangon-Kataf and Kauru LGAs carried out the killings, looting and the destructions of their property. Representatives of the coalition, who spoke at a press conference in Kaduna on Friday, also accused the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union, an umbrella body of the people from the southern part of the state, of endorsing the killings of their kinsmen. The Secretary General of one of the groups, Mobgal Fulbe Development Association, Nuhu Ibrahim, stated that apart from the 139 of its members that were still missing, several houses were razed in their communities. However, in its reaction, SOKAPU said it was not aware of any violence that claimed 99 lives of Fulani extraction in any Southern Kaduna villages. The National Public Relations Officer of SOKAPU, Luka Binniyat, told Saturday PUNCH, “Every life matters to us in SOKAPU. We believe that Fulani and Hausa settlers in Southern Kaduna are part of one family. “As far as we are concern, nothing happened in Zango-Kataf. We are not aware of any violence on Fulani in Atyap villages.” Efforts to get the reaction of the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mohammed Jalige, proved abortive as he had yet to respond as of the time of filing this report.
