I will not tolerate breaching of due process in procurement and other financial transactions,” Adesugba declared. He charged workers of the agency to ensure proper record keeping and observance of the internal processes, stressing that all transactions must be within the bound of the law. “If there is any infraction, I will act swiftly against culprits. There must be no excuse,” he stated. Adesugba added, “I am a stickler for transparency and accountability. Any official who breaches the financial protocols will be sanctioned.” He said the management would conduct governance audit to ensure the right things were done and that the agency must adopt and follow its processes based on extant regulations.
