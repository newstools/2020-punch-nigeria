Kelvin Ekerete Nigerian Ultimate Fighting Championship Welterweight champion, Kamaru Usman, has promised to break Jorge Masvidal’s spirit in their title fight on July 12, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Masvidal was a late replacement for Gilbert Burns, who tested positive for coronavirus days before their fight in the UAE. The fight is Usman’s second title defence after defeating Colby Covington via knockout in the fifth round in December 2019 in Las Vegas. Usman has the best win record in the UFC, having gone 15 fights without a loss, while his opponent has lost four of his last 10 fights but won his last three via knockout. The “Nigerian Nightmare” says he prefers to beat his opponent to submission by breaking his spirit over gaining a first-round knockout victory. “If I knock him out in the first round, I’m going to take it and go home but I want to break him mentally, I want to break his spirit. There is something about a man when you break his spirit. When he talks about you, he knows that you’re better than him,” Usman told the media. “I’d rather beat a guy with a wide margin that they never ever dream of competing with me again and that’s how I’m going to approach this fight. “This is the fight people want and the fans are going to get it. “The fans know if an opponent is a challenger or not. Jorge had such an amazing year in 2018 and 2019 and that puts him in that category. He is the next biggest challenge for me and I’m excited. I can’t wait,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
