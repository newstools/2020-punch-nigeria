Sampson Itode Many residents on Monday  sustained injuries in a rival cult clash in Amadi-Ama community, Port Harcourt City Local Government Area of Rivers State. It was learnt that mayhem was unleashed around 6am on Monday following a supremacy battle between Icelanders and Greenlanders confraternities. An eyewitness, who identified himself as ThankGod, said two persons died in the fracas, adding that all the cultists escaped upon sighting the police. He said, “This morning, the two cults in Amadi-Ama clashed; they fought for about two hours; several people sustained bullet wounds and other injuries. “Two persons died, but I don’t know whether they are cult members. It was after the police came that they all ran away.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Nnamdi Omoni, confirmed the incident but said order had been restored in the area. He said, “We are aware of the unfortunate and senseless act of supremacy war between Icelander and Greenlander cults at Amadi-Ama this morning. “We were alerted and we mobilised to the scene, but on arrival, the bad boys fled; the police are on their trail. Meanwhile, we have restored normalcy in the area. “A tricycle driver was shot in the leg in the incident and he is receiving treatment. So far, no life was lost in the incident. We have taken over the place.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
