Eniola Akinkuotu and Samson Folarin The Oniru of Iru Kingdom, Oba Gbolahan Lawal, has suspended a palace official for alleged involvement in a fracas between some palace guards and some men led by the son of a former Oniru. The new Oniru and the family of his predecessor had been embroiled in a dispute over some properties worth billions of naira in the Eti-Osa Local Government Area. Trouble started early Sunday when Oba Lawal ordered some palace guards to post public notices on some of the properties under contention. Some men believed to be loyal to Prince Tijani Oniru, the son of the late Oniru, were reported to have beaten up those posting the notices, led by Prince Murisiku Ajasa. This was said to have led to a fracas between the two groups, until the intervention of the police. Lawal, in a statement by his media office on Monday, said the incident happened within the Oniru Estate neighbourhood close to Millennium Estate Gates. The statement noted that the Oniru had ordered the suspension of Ajasa. “Notwithstanding the provocative affront to the authority of the Oniru and desecration of tradition, the Oniru warned palace officials to remain emotionally stable in the discharge of their duties, even in the face of provocation. “In addition, he sees no reason or excuse for violence in Iru Land. Consequently, kabiyesi has directed the palace administrator to immediately suspend the official involved in the incident pending full investigation,” the statement added. Copyright PUNCH.
