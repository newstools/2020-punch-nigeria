‘Tosin Oluwalowo The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Wednesday struck out the stay of execution application filed by the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development over the recognition of Ibrahim Shehu-Gusau as President of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria. The court, which struck out the stay of execution after the sports ministry withdrew the application, reserved date for the judgment for a later date after hearing the appeal by the ministry. A Federal High Court in Abuja had July 1 ruled that Gusau remained the president of the AFN, declaring his suspension and subsequent impeachment by the board led by his vice, Olamide George, as illegal. The sports ministry then filed an appeal against the judgment and a stay of execution of the High Court’s judgment at the Appeal Court. A statement by AFN legal adviser, Kingsley Irikefe, said with the stay of execution denial, Gusau remained president of the athletics body. By striking out the application for stay of execution, Ibrahim Shehu-Gusau, remains the president of the AFN,” Irikefe said. But Special Adviser on Media to the sports minister, John Joshua-Akanji, declined to comment on the court ruling, saying, “The matter is already in court and I won’t be able to comment on it.” Copyright PUNCH.
