Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A 35-year-old man, Maruf Ojo, was on Monday jailed for one month by an Osun State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Ile-Ife for stealing plantain. The defendant, who stole bunches of plantain worth N55,000, pleaded guilty to the one count of stealing pressed against him by the police. The police prosecutor, Sunday Osanyintuyi, said the convict committed the offence on July 17, 2020, at Oke-Ora village, via Ile-Ife. Osanyintuyi explained that Ojo stole some bunches of plantain valued at N55,000, which belonged to one Sunday Oladipupo. According to him, the offence contravened sections 383 and 390(9) of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun State, 2002. Ojo’s counsel, Mrs Tosin Omoyeni, pleaded with the court to be lenient with him. Magistrate A. A. Adebayo, in her judgment, noted that the defendant was a first time offender. She, therefore, sentenced him to one month in a correctional centre or an option of N1,000 fine.
