Ada Wodu, Calabar THE Vice Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress, Cross River State chapter, Lawrence Achuta, has faulted the suspension of the one-week-old strike by civil servants to press home their eight-point demand bordering on their welfare. While there was a statement issued by the Action Committee of the union, tagged Bulletin 9, suspending the strike on Friday, Achuta said those behind the suspension, including the state Chairman, Benedict Ukpepi, acted unilaterally. The Action Committee allegedly backed by the NLC chairman had said in a statement that following two recent meetings between the state government and the NLC, Trade Union Congress and the Joint Negotiating Council, that the government agreed to commence phased implementation of all deserved promotion of both state and local government staff from July 2020 as part of its demands. “Government also promised to commence the screening and restoration of names dropped from payroll in September 2019. “Consequently, the organised labour hereby suspends the ongoing strike from 3rd July, 2020 to give way for further discussion on the aforementioned items. All civil/public servants are herby directed to resume work immediately,” it stated. Reacting, Achuta said, “May I, as Vice Chairman of the NLC, dissociate myself from this Bulletin 9. The State Administrative Council of Congress and the State Executive Council have not met to decide on the suspension of the strike. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
