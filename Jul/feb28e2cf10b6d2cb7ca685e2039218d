Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri The convoy of Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State was attacked on Wednesday by terrorist sect, Boko Haram, along the Baga highway, in the northern part of the troubled state. The area is believed to be dangerous and has recorded many abductions by the terrorist group in recent times. It was on the same axis that five aid workers, who were killed about a week ago, were abducted in June this year. A splinter of the Boko Haram sect, the Islamic State of West Africa Province, is believed to have a stronghold in the area. The governor was seen leaving the state capital Maiduguri on Monday to personally oversee the distribution of palliatives to internally displaced persons in some local governments.
