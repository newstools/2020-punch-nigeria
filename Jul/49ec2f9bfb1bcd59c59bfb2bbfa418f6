Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, will play his first North London derby in charge when he leads the Gunners to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday (today). Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal meet in a unique North London derby on Sunday afternoon with the sides separated by one point and one place in the Premier League. The famous fixture will be staged behind closed doors at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first time owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Arsenal enters the fixture in better form than their local rivals and are a point better off in the final Europa League qualifying spot. Far sooner than many had predicted, Tottenham supporters already appear to be losing faith in head coach Jose Mourinho following a poor set of results. Spurs have won back-to-back home matches, against West Ham United and Everton, but those are their only two victories in 11 matches stretching back to mid-February. Losing 3-1 to Sheffield United last week was a tough one to take given the VAR furore surrounding the match, but the stalemate with Bournemouth could well prove Mourinhoâ€™s nadir. Against a side horribly out of form and fresh on the back of shipping five to Manchester United, Tottenham failed to register a single attempt on target. Not only have the results been disappointing, with Spurs exiting two cup competitions in the space of a week before the lockdown, the performances have arguably been even worse. Matters boiled over on the field earlier this week, too, with Son Heung-min and Hugo Lloris squaring up just before half time in the slender win over Everton.
