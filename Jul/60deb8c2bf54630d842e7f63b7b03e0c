Peter David, Benin City The National Vice-Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (South-South), Chief Dan Orbih, on Tuesday said Edo State was not the property of a former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole. Orbih, who is the Chairman of the state Campaign Council of the PDP for the September 19 governorship election, urged the electorate to vote for Governor Godwin Obaseki for sustainable development and growth of the state. He stated this in Benin City during the inauguration of the campaign council and sub-committees for the election. According to Orbih, Obaseki should be trusted for his refusal to continue with the culture of sharing the money at the expense of developing the state and detriment of Edo people. He said, “Those at the forefront in the campaign to take the state back must be stopped. This state is not the property of Adams Oshiomhole. This is the moment of truth and not for self-proclaimed liars and political apologists. In 2016, Ize-Iyamu apologized for making Adams Oshiomhole governor. In 2020 it’s the turn of Adams Oshiomhole. Edo people are too politically sophisticated to be fooled. “Edo people must be informed that Government business is serious business. It is not a simple agenda! Edo people rejected the simple agenda in 2016 and will do so again in 2020. From today we are going to take our campaigns to the people. Let the people decides. Not in Adams but in God we trust, and with the support of the people Governor Godwin Obaseki will win again.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
