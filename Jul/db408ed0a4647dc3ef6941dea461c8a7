Tottenham secured their place in next season’s Europa League with a hard-fought draw at Crystal Palace. The result sees Jose Mourinho’s side leapfrog into sixth place above Wolves, who lost at Chelsea. Harry Kane opened the scoring for Spurs, dispatching a low finish into the bottom left corner after collecting Giovani lo Celso’s pass. However, Jeffrey Schlupp levelled for Palace with a close-range finish after some poor Tottenham marking at a corner. It was no more than Roy Hodgson’s side deserved, as they ended a run of seven straight defeats.
