Kelvin Ekerete Senegal defender, Kalidou Koulibaly, says joining Napoli would be a good choice for Nigeria international, Victor Osimhen. The highly sought after defensive stalwart said the Lille striker had reached out to him over a possible move to the Italian side. Osimhen has been strongly linked with the Serie A club after a breakthrough season with French side Lille, where he scored 18 goals in 38 appearances in his debut campaign. “It’s true, he did call me. I reassured him, if he is to come here, it’s the best choice. The rest is up to the directors,” Koulibaly told  La Gazzetta dello Sport. “We talked about racism and I told him that coming to Naples, he’d have no problems, this is the right city. I too have felt the bitter experience of racist insults, but never in Naples. “My family is very happy in Naples, I’ve been here for six years and if they hadn’t been happy, I would have already left. My children speak Italian as well as French, it’s a beautiful place to live.” Napoli president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, has made the Nigerian a top priority for the club and invited the striker to Naples for a facility visit, where Osimhen had a chat with the club manager, Gennaro Gattuso. Osimhen is yet to make up his mind over a move to the club despite reports claiming he had given Tuesday last week as his decision-making day. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United have all shown interest in the player. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
