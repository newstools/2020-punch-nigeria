Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Ahead of the resumption of commercial domestic flights on Wednesday (today), operators in the aviation sector have introduced various mechanisms to protect themselves from the possible spread of coronavirus. It was observed that while the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria ensured that passengers stick to the safety protocols against COVID-19 at airports, other operators introduced transparent front desk shields between ticketing officers and passengers. At the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, front desk officers of various operators now sit behind transparent glass shields while relating with passengers. Although some operators had deployed this mechanism before the outbreak of COVID-19, it was not widespread at the terminals. But on Tuesday, most operators at the NAIA had the new shield on their counters. The spokesperson of the NAIA, Voke Ivbaze, told our correspondent that the Abuja airport was ready to begin operations. She said the transparent shields introduced at various counters in the airport were part of measures adopted by the authority and other operators to curb COVID-19 spread. “We are ready to commence operations. Most of the airlines too are ready. All you see are precautions and measures to mitigate the spread of the virus,” she said. It was also observed that the seats at the terminals had been widely spaced, as the airports authority ensured that passengers observed the physical distancing order of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control.
