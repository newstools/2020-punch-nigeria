Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja Musician, Oladapo Oyebanjo aka D’Banj, has dragged his accuser, Seyitan Babatayo, before an FCT High Court demanding N1bn for general damages and N500m for aggravated, punitive and exemplary damages. Babatayo had accused D’Banj of raping her in Glee Hotel, Lagos, sometime in December 2018, an allegation the musician has denied. In the suit filed on his behalf by his lawyer, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), the musician sought an order barring Babatayo from making further accusations against his person. He also seeks an apology from his accuser for the mental agony, ridicule, embarrassment and marital disharmony her tweets have caused.
