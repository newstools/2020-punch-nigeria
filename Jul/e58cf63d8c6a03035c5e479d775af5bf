John Charles, Makurdi The Benue State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Makurdi, on Tuesday, remanded one Alhaji Sani Hashimu, 46, in the Makurdi Medium Correctional Centre for allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl. Chief Magistrate Isaac Ajim ordered that the accused person, who lives at No. 54 Bauchi Street, Wadata area of Makurdi, be remanded due to the weight of the offence. The police prosecutor, Sergeant Friday Kanshio, told the court that one Abdullazak Umuru of No. 8 Ejule Street, Wurukum, Makurdi went to the Police Area Command to lodge a complaint that on July 7, 2020, around 9am, he sent his 13-year-old daughter to sell groundnuts and while on her way to the market, the accused forcefully dragged her into his room and had sexual intercourse with her without her consent. He stated that the offence was contrary to Section 284 of the Penal Code, Law of Benue State, 2004. However, the plea of the accused was not taken because the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the matter. Hashimu insisted he never committed the offence. Kanshio told the court that investigation was still on and asked for another date to enable the police to complete investigation into the matter. Ajim ordered that the accused be remanded in the Federal Correctional Centre, Makurdi, and adjourned the case till October 9, 2020, for further mention. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
