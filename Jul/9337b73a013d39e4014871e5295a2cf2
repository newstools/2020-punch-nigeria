Sodiq Oyeleke The Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, met with the National Leader of All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, on Friday. Akeredolu, who announced the meeting via his Twitter handle, said he also met with the governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The meeting is coming barely 10 weeks to the Ondo governorship election. Akeredolu is expected to slug it out with 16 other candidates to actualise his second term ambition.  He tweeted, “Today, I visited our leader @AsiwajuTinubu and my brother @jidesanwoolu to formally introduce my Deputy Governor-designate and consult with them for the forthcoming election in Ondo State. We are one in @OfficialAPCNg and our party is stronger than ever.” Before the meeting, there had been speculations that Tinubu was opposed to the second term ambition of Akeredolu. Tinubu had since denied the allegation which made the round before the Ondo APC primary election. In a statement, Tinubu said all he desired was a free, fair, and credible primary that is “is run according to the dictates of internal democracy and are devoid of bias for or against any candidate.”
