Twitter says 130 accounts were targeted in a major cyber-attack of celebrity accounts. However, Twitter said only a small subset of those 130 accounts had control seized by the attacker, BBC news reported on Friday. The security breach saw accounts including those of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Kanye West and Bill Gates tweet a Bitcoin scam to millions of followers. Twitter said it was still trying to work out if private data – which could include direct messages – was stolen. “We are working with impacted account-owners and will continue to do so over the next several days,” the company said, through its official support account. “We are continuing to assess whether non-public data related to these accounts was compromised,” it added. On 15 July, a number of Bitcoin-related accounts began tweeting what appeared to be a simple Bitcoin scam, promising to give back to the community by doubling any Bitcoin sent to their address. Then, the apparent scam spread to mainstream celebrity accounts such as Kim Kardashian West, and former vice-president Joe Biden, and those of corporations Apple and Uber. Twitter scrambled to contain the unprecedented attack, temporarily preventing all verified users – those with a blue tick on their accounts – from tweeting. Attackers were able to bypass account security because they had somehow gained access to Twitter’s own internal administration tools. However, Trump, one of the most prominent Twitter users, was unaffected. There has been speculation for some time that Trump had extra protections in place after his account was deactivated by an employee on their last day of work in 2017. The New York Times confirmed that was how Trump’s account escaped the attack, citing an anonymous White House official and a separate Twitter employee. Despite the fact that the scam was obvious to some, the attackers received hundreds of transfers, worth more than $100,000 (£80,000).
