Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The personnel of the Ogun State Police Command, on Monday, arrested two suspected robbers, who allegedly specialised in snatching motorcycles from their owners at gunpoint in Ijebu-Ode and its environs. The suspects were reportedly caught while trying to snatch a motorcycle after they had dispossessed two riders of their motorcycles. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Monday. Oyeyemi said the suspects, Joshua Michael, 27, and Emeka Nwanga, 26, were arrested following a distress call received by the Divisional Police Officer, Ilese-Ijebu, SP Olusesi Kayode. He said the police were alerted that armed robbers were about to snatch a motorcycle from its owner around the Ikangba Estate, Ijebu-Ode. The PPRO stated, “Upon the distress call, the DPO, SP Olusesi Kayode, quickly mobilised his anti-robbery team to the scene. On sighting the policemen, the suspects took to their heels, but they were hotly pursued and apprehended with the help of members of the public. “The motorcyclist and his machine were rescued from the bandits. Recovered from the hoodlums was a locally-made double-barrelled pistol.” Oyeyemi added that the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, had ordered the transfer of the suspects to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad for discreet investigation and prosecution.
