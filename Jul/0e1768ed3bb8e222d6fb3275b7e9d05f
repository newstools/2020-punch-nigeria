Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti A former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, on Thursday said the Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, and a former Minister of Works, Senator Adedayo Adeyeye, have no electoral value and they were not welcome into the Peoples Democratic Party. Fayose said although the two All Progressives Congress chieftains had problems with Governor Kayode Fayemi, the PDP was not ready to accommodate people that would not add any value to it. The two APC chieftains and others are locked in a battle of wits with Fayemi, who they alleged was dictatorial. They also accused him of victimising perceived critics of his government. The former governor, who spoke through his media aide, Lere Olayinka, in a statement, said, “Apart from not having electoral value, they (Ojudu and Adeyeye) are blackmailers and individuals whose needs are insatiable. Above all, God’s anger has caught up with them in their inordinate quest for power.” Fayose’s statement was in response to an earlier statement credited to Ojudu on a radio programme in Ado Ekiti. Ojodu was quoted as saying he would never contemplate joining PDP, adding, “If I die and they put the PDP flag on my coffin, I will wake up, tear it and go back to sleep.” In response, Fayose described the presidential aide as “an opportunist, who is always fighting for selfish gains. He fought against Niyi Adebayo, myself, Segun Oni and he is fighting Fayemi now. Who will please him in Ekiti? “As for us in the PDP, we are not interested in making any gain from the reckless political life of a man who does nothing other than to destroy the government of Ekiti,” he added.
