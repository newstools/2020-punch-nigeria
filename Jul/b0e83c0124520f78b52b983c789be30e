Dayo Ojerinde The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr Sunday Dare, has urged  Nigerian youths to seek knowledge and acquire skills that will enable the country to overcome the current economic challenge posed by COVID-19. Dare, in a statement to commemorate the World Youth Skills Day on Thursday,  said there was no better time for young Nigerians to think differently and acquire new skills than now. “I congratulate all Nigerian youths on World Youth Day 2020. It is heart-warming to see all the efforts put in by young people in these most trying of times. I celebrate with you all, especially those who have taken it upon themselves to invest the free time forced on them by the global pandemic lockdowns to explore new horizons and develop new skills. The pandemic has seen our youths rise up to exhibit their ideas, skills and potentials churning out innovative technology, apps and products. “COVID-19 has changed the world in many ways and the best way to adapt is to engage your mind and body in the most creative and entrepreneurial way possible,” he said. The minister added that over 11,000 people had gained new digital skills via online training programmes through a partnership between his ministry and IBM. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
