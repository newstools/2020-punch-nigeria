Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State Government has sealed off the premises of Victory College, Ilawe Ekiti, in the Ekiti South West Local Government Area for allegedly violating its directives on the closure of schools as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government also said the proprietor of the private school, who is reportedly on the run, “will face the wrath of the law for the violation of COVID-19 protocols in the state whenever he is apprehended.” The Commissioner for Education, Mr Foluso Daramola, who gave the order in Ado-Ekiti on Friday after receiving the interim report from officials of the ministry, who investigated the activities of the private school, said security agents were already on the trail of the proprietor. A statement by the Assistant Director, Information, in the ministry, Kunle Adeniyi, made available on Sunday stated that the proprietor of the school was discovered to be organising extramural classes for pupils in total violation of the subsisting government directive on the closure of schools in the state. Daramola restated the commitment of the Governor Kayode Fayemi administration to the healthy living of all the citizens of the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
