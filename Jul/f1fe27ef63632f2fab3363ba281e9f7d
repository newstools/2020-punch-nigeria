Johnny Edward Former Super Eagles goalkeeper Ndubuisi Egbo is two wins away from leading KF Tirana to the league title in Albania, The PUNCH reports. If Tirana emerge league winners, it would be the first time a Nigerian would lead a European team to the league title. Egbo’s Tirana currently lead the Albanian top flight with 66 points from 33 games and need at least six points to be crowned champions of the division. Second-placed Kukesi are four points adrift Tirana with 62 points from the same games played. Tirana will face Flamurtari, Laci and Bylis in their remaining three league fixtures of the season. When asked of his team’s chances of clinching the title, the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations bronze medalist told The PUNCH, “We still have three games to finish the league and it’s not over yet. “We are four points from the second position and we need maximum points from two of our remaining games to be champions, that is assuming the team in the second position win all their games.” Meanwhile, his side trail seventh-place Bylis 2-1 ahead of the second leg of the Albanian Cup final billed for Wednesday.
