Godwin ISENYO, Kaduna A coalition of Civil Society Organisations under the aegis of the Nigeria Citizens Action Group on Monday demanded the immediate reversal of the hike in the pump price of petrol. The Federal Government last week announced the increase in the pump price of petrol from N123.5 to N143.5. According to the group, the increment has the potential of inciting Nigerians against the present government of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Against this backdrop, the group gave the Federal Government a seven-day ultimatum to reverse the increase. The Chairman of the Nigeria Citizens Action Group, who is also the national president, Northern Youth Council, Alhaji Issa Abubakar, while addressing a press conference in Kaduna on Monday, said the group would occupy the NNPC head office in Abuja if their demands were not met. The group accused the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Silva; the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation, Mele Kyari; and the Executive Secretary of the Petroleum Products  Pricing Regulatory Agency, AbdulKadir Umar, of masterminding the increment. They demanded the resignation of the government officials within seven days. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
