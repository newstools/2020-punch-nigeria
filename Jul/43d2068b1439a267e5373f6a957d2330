Peter Dada, Akure A former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has expressed confidence that the Peoples Democratic Party will win the Ondo State governorship election scheduled to hold on October 10. Ekweremadu said this in Akure, on Wednesday after monitoring the delegates election across the 18 local government areas of the state. He said, “PDP is well positioned in Ondo State and we are ready to take over power in the state. Members here have resolved their differences and they are willing to work as a team to dislodge the APC. “In the last election, we have two senators and APC has one. That is to show that we are ready and prepared to win Ondo State. Speaking on the controversy over the party’s delegates’ list for the primary, he said. “There were some complains and I am happy those complains have been resolved. The July 22nd date for the PDP primaries in Ondo is still sacrosanct. “You can see that the delegate election was free and fair. It was well conducted and we are happy with the outcome. There was no violence. Nobody spotted any cheating. “Part of our earlier problem was disunity in the party and there were some people who were disrupting the party issues and programme. I believe our people in the PDP in Ondo have learnt their lessons.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
