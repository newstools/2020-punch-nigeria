Wale Oyewale, Ibadan Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State is proposing a N3 billion investment plan for water supply in cities and rural areas in the state, the Chairman, Oyo State Rurally Water Supply and Sanitation Agency, Najeem Omirinde, has said. Ominrinde made the disclosure during a radio interview in Ibadan on Monday. He noted that of the N3billion water investment plan, N500million was proposed for the repair of faulty public boreholes across the state. This, he said, was projected to take the burden of repair of water facilities away from the people of the state. He said chairmen of the local government areas had been asked to submit lists of 10 faulty boreholes in their areas for repair. He said, “Oyo RUWASSA has already contacted the chairmen of all the local government council areas in the state to make a list of 10 faulty boreholes in their areas for repair. This is to reduce the number of boreholes to be dug to make the environment friendly and as well, to cut cost. “The governor has assured the people of the state of his readiness to make water available, both from the surface (dam) and from the deep ground, to ease the burden of our people’s quest for water. “Governor Makinde has set aside a N3billion water investment plan for immediate solution to water problem in Oyo State. From this, the sum of N500million will be used for repair of faulty boreholes in all public areas.
