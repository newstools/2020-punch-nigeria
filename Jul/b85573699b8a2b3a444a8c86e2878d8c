Kayode Oyero Nigerians have poured out their emotions, shock and raw grief over the murder of the founder and Chief Executive Officer of ride-hailing company Gokada, Fahim Saleh. Many have described the killing of Saleh, whose dismembered remains were found in his home on Manhattan’s Lower East Side on Tuesday afternoon, as “heartless” and “despicable”. According to homicide detectives, the torso, head and limbs of the 33-year-old technology entrepreneur were found in separate places within the apartment. Since the news broke out about the incident, many Nigerians have since taken to social media to condemn the murder of the entrepreneur who started Gokada in Lagos State in 2018. @DrOlufunmilayo wrote, “The electric saw used to slice him up was also found.
