Enyioha Opara, Minna Lawmakers in the Niger State House of Assembly has sacked the House Majority Leader, Musa Nasko and his Deputy, Andrew Jagaba, citing a lack of confidence in their leadership. The motion for their removal was moved by the member representing Lavun constituency, Jibrin Baba, during Thursday’s plenary. While moving the motion, Baba said, the decision was taken after due consultations with other members. His colleagues seconded the motion after which two of them, Muhammed Bala representing Borgu, and the only female member, Binta Mamman representing Gurara constituency, were elected as the new leader and deputy leader respectively. Speaker of the House, Abdullahi Wuse, raised a constitutional point of order but the order was suspended and the nomination approved. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
