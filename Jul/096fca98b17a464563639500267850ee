This was contained in a statement signed by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Yemi Kolapo. Arinze said, “Today, history is being made in Ondo State with the victory of Prince Dapo Adelegan. It is clear that from all we have seen here, ADC is going to emerge victorious in the forthcoming poll. The people are tired of the ruling party; they are also clearly tired of the Peoples Democratic Party. “We are a credible alternative. And we are presenting one of their very best sons to lead the state out of its present state of socio-economic neglect. Surely, we shall come out victorious.” The governorship candidate, who is from Owo, Ondo North Senatorial District, thanked party members and leaders for their support and assured the party of victory in the forthcoming poll, stressing that ADC would defeat the ruling party.
