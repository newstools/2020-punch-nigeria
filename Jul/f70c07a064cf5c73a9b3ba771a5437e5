Peter Dada, Akure Barely 48 hours to the Ondo State Peoples Democratic Party governorship primary, one of the party’s aspirants, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, has expressed confidence that he will emerge victorious. Jegede said this in Akure, on Monday. The former Ondo State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice said he was not threatened by the presence of the state deputy governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi, who recently defected to the PDP from the All Progressives Congress, in the race for the PDP ticket. Jegede said, “I contested against his boss, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, in 2016 and I came second. If Akeredolu was not a threat to me in 2016, his deputy cannot be a threat to me or my ambition in 2020.” The governorship aspirant, who noted that his credentials were intimidating and good enough to speak for him, declared that the PDP would win the governorship election come October 10. Also, a former deputy governor of Ondo State, Otunba Omolade Oluwateru, said Jegede had the best qualities and deserved to obtain the party’s ticket in Wednesday’s primary election. Oluwateru stated this while hosting the Akure South Local Government party delegates, adding that Jegede could be trusted. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
