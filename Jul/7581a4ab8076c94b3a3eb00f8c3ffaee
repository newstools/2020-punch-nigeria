Oladimeji Ramon A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Oyo State, Rotimi Ajanaku, has asked the state’s party chairman, Chief Akin Oke, to ensure equal opportunities for all members. Ajanaku stressed the need for the party to reconcile all aggrieved members in order not to jeopardise the fortunes of the party ahead of the 2023 general elections. In a statement on Thursday, Ajanaku called on Oke not to pretend that all was well with the Oyo APC when it was not. He said, “Perhaps, I should remind the chairman that shortly after the 2019 elections when the party first made a move to reconcile its members, the leadership of the party under the authority of the late Senator Isiaka Abiola Ajimobi promised to ensure that those affected by the irregularities that characterised 2019 primaries would be compensated with various appointments. Can the chairman mention or list the names of those who have so been compensated? “To me, as a progressive party, our mission is clear. The party must provide every person, not just the privileged, with an equal opportunity to pursue a better life, through equal access to the individual dreams.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
