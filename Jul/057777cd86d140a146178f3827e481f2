Peter Dada, Akure There are strong indications that the Ondo State Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi, has concluded plans to dump the Peoples Democratic Party to join the Zenith Labour Party to contest the forthcoming governorship election. Ajayi, who lost the PDP primary to Eyitayo Jegede last Wednesday, reportedly held meetings with leaders of the ZLP, as well as the National Leader of the party, who is also a former governor of the state, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, to work out the details. A close associate of the deputy governor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, on Wednesday, said, “Ajayi has settled for the ZLP to run against Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and the PDP’s candidate, Eyitayo Jegede.” When contacted, the Chief Press Secretary to the deputy governor, Mr Tope Okeowo, said he was not aware of the development.
