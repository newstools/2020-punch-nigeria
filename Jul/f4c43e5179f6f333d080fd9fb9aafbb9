Raphael Ede Tragedy struck again in the University Town of Nsukka, Enugu State on Saturday as a former local government caretaker committee chairman, Mrs Chinwe Ugwu,  died 18 days after her successor, Patrick Omeje’s demise. Ugwu was said to have died on Saturday after a brief illness. The secretary to the council, Damian Eze, who confirmed Ugwu’s demise to our correspondent, said her corpse had been deposited at the mortuary. Eze said the council had again been thrown into mourning as the remains of Omeje, who died on June 16, were still at the Bishop Shanahan Hospital morgue in Nsukka. Also, the council lost a former senator, Fidelis Okoro, about two months ago. His remains have yet to be buried. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
