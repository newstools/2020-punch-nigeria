Peter David, Benin A pressure group, the Edo Diaspora Group, has expressed confidence that Governor Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Mr Philip Shaibu, will win their second-term bid on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. Spokesperson for the group, Mr Stanley Osakhuenorkhodin, said this during the commencement of the group’s campaign for Obaseki in major markets in Benin City. The group said Obaseki had done enough to deserve a second term. He said, “I strongly believe that this umbrella body that covers all Edo people in the diaspora will deliver Obaseki. “We are going to ensure that our campaigns continue until we hear the final whistle because we are aware that some persons from the other divide, who know that they are no longer enjoying the goodwill of Edo people, believe that they can only achieve their aim through rigging. “Some of them are boasting that we will deploy federal might, I am glad to say today that President Muhammadu Buhari is a man who has promised entire Nigerians that he will adhere to the rule of law. “But the truth is that regardless of whatever they want to do, we will confront them and we will deliver as Edo people. We will stand firm and we know that by the grace of God almighty, I want to use this opportunity to tell Edo people that, in a campaign such as this, you must be ready not just to vote, but to also defend your vote.
