Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Tuesday said the appointment and sacking of service chiefs remained the prerogative of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Adesina said this in a statement titled “Service chiefs: Position of Presidency on resolution by the Senate.” He was responding to the Senate which on Tuesday asked the nation’s heads of armed forces to step aside following the killings of soldiers currently fighting insurgency and banditry in some parts of northern Nigeria. Adesina said the Presidency noted the resolution and that Buhari would do what is in the best interest of the country at all times. The statement read, “The Senate Tuesday adopted a resolution calling on the service chiefs to resign or be sacked due to the multi-pronged security challenges in the country. “The Presidency notes the resolution, and reiterates that appointment or sack of service chiefs is a presidential prerogative, and President Muhammadu Buhari, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, will do what is in the best interest of the country at all times.”
