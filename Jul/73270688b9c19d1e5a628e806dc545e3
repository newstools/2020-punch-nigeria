Oladimeji Ramon The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has congratulated the Publisher of Premium Times, Mr Dapo Olorunyomi, on his emergence as one of the three winners of the 2020 edition of the International Press Freedom award. The award is organised by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists to honour journalists around the world, “who show courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks, threat or imprisonment.” In a congratulatory statement on Sunday by his media aide, Tunde Rahman, Tinubu described Olorunyomi’s winning as deserving, thanking him for “making Nigeria proud again.” The politician said, “The announcement of social crusader, journalist and publisher of Premium Times, Mr Dapo Olorunyomi, as one of the three winners of this year’s International Press Freedom award of the prestigious Committee for the Protection of Journalists is a befitting reward for his untiring service to the country he loves with uncompromising passion and to people-centred journalism. “By placing premium on the welfare of the citizenry as the purpose of governance, Premium Times, Olorunyomi’s stable, conscientises the people and their leaders on the primacy of the social contract and the transparent delivery of democratic dividends.” Tinubu said Olorunyomi must see the award as “a challenge to strive harder in his patriotic endeavour to bring power to the people.” Copyright PUNCH.
