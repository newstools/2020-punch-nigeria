Deji Lambo A firm, Lee Group of Companies, has donated 1.5 million face masks to some states as support for the fight against COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The Managing Director of the firm, Philip Seng, said they had watched with admiration how both federal and state governments combated the effect of the pandemic on the populace. Seng, who spoke while donating the items to Ondo State, commended Governor Rotimi Akeredolu’s efforts in curbing the spread of the virus. “We have therefore brought into the country a total of 1.5 million face masks as part of our commitment to support the Federal Government and the states where our company is located. “As a responsible corporate citizen in support of the Ondo State Government’s efforts in tackling this pandemic, we are donating bio-based disposable face masks to the state government. This, we believe, will go a long way in assisting the government in its fight against the pandemic and together we shall defeat this pandemic,” he added. Seng was said to have earlier donated some of the face masks to Ogun, Lagos and Osun states. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
