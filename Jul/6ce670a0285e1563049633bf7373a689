Olalekan Adetayo The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), on Saturday urged African leaders to recommit themselves to reclaiming the continent from corruption. According to a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President made the call in a letter he wrote to South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, who is the Chairman of the African Union, in commemoration of the Anti-Corruption Day. The statement was titled ‘On Africa Anti-Corruption Day, President Buhari Calls for Operationailsation of Common Position on Assets Recovery.’ Buhari also urged African leaders to ensure the immediate actualisation of the Common African Position on Assets Recovery. The President lamented what he called the massive corruption being perpetrated across national governments. He said such a situation had created a huge governance deficit that had in turn created negative consequences that had worsened the socioeconomic and political situations in Africa. He said, “The continental fight against corruption has been premised on an irreducible minimum that can pave the way for Africa’s transformation.  In this effort, the emphasis has been on the continent’s collective determination to forge resilient partnerships among our national governments, civil society organisations and other interest groups, such as women, youth and the physically challenged, to ensure improved socioeconomic, political and security developments and ultimately, the improvement of our continent.” Copyright PUNCH.
