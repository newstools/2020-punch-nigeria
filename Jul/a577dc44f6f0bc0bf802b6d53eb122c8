Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A 50-year-old man, Taiwo Aina, on Wednesday, appeared before an Osun State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Osogbo for allegedly attempting to rape his neighbour. The victim, said to be a school teacher, was a neighbour to the defendant. The police prosecutor, Abiodun Fagboyinbo, said the defendant committed the offence on June 27, 2020, in the Agunbelewo area of Osogbo. Fagboyinbo said Aina attempted to rape and unlawfully assaulted the victim. He said the defendant punched the complainant in the mouth and inflicted injury on her. The offences were said to be contrary to and punishable under sections 359 and 360 of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Vol. II, Laws of Osun State Nigeria, 2002. The victim said she was a school teacher and resident in the same neighbourhood as the defendant. Aina, however, pleaded not guilty to the two counts of attempted rape and assault pressed against him. His counsel, Nagite Okobe, urged the court to admit him to bail. In his ruling, the presiding magistrate, Mr Opeyemi Badmus, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N500,000 with one surety. He adjourned the matter to July 9, 2020, for hearing.
