Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Osun State Government on Monday announced guidelines for the partial reopening of schools to students in exit classes. The government said the decision was in line with the unanimous decision reached at a virtual consultative meeting between the Federal Ministry of Education, commissioners for education of the 36 states, the Nigerian Union of Teachers, the Proprietors of Private Schools and Chief Executives of examination bodies. A statement by the State’s Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs Funke Egbemode, said at the virtual State Executive Council meeting on Monday, it was agreed that teachers should resume on Tuesday, August 4, while students would resume on Thursday, August 6. Egbemode, while outlining the details of the partial reopening, said “a total of 188 schools consisting 13,177 students, will reopen under this arrangement. “Parents are expected to provide face masks/nose covers for their children or wards, while principals and proprietors of schools are expected to ensure a tidy environment with desks arranged at least two meters apart. This social distancing shall be ensured by class wardens.” Part of the decision was to afford students a two-week preparatory period for the West African Examination Council (WAEC), which commences August 17, 2020.
