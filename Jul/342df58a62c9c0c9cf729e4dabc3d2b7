Adebayo Folorunsho-Francis Health practitioners and other stakeholders have expressed concerns about Nigeria’s continued procurement of medical oxygen supplied in cylinders across major isolation centres, especially in Lagos, the epicentre of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Though, since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nigeria on February 28, the number of organisations distributing oxygen to public hospitals and other government-owned health facilities has increased, the World Health Organisation warns that many severely ill COVID-19 patients are not getting the oxygen they need to stay alive. WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had said at a recent media briefing that with the current rate of one million new cases of COVID-19 weekly, the world needed about 620,000 cubic meters of oxygen a day, which is about 88,000 large cylinders. One in five COVID-19 cases has respiratory challenge In his situation analysis released on June 26, 2020, Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, said the majority of COVID-19-related deaths in the state were due to patients presenting late to health facilities, with underlying health conditions and severe symptom of respiratory challenge. Abayomi said one in five persons with respiratory symptoms in Lagos seemed to be positive for COVID-19 pandemic and had to be put on oxygen in most cases. “We are getting between 15 and 20 per cent positivity among the people who are presenting with respiratory symptoms, fever or things like that. “What we are seeing now is that one in five people in Lagos right now with respiratory sickness is due to COVID-19,” he said during one of the briefings.
