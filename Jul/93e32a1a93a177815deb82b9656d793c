Bola Bamigbola A group of hoodlums led by a man simply identified as Ikeja and some Hausa traders clashed on Saturday in Osun State. Many were reportedly injured in the clash but no fatality had been confirmed as of the time of filing this report. Armed policemen were seen patrolling the Sabo area of Osogbo, the state capital, to restore normalcy. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Yemisi Opalola, told our correspondent that “policemen have been deployed in the scene and the situation is under control.” A resident of Sabo, Babatunde Ojo, linked the clash to the fallout of an altercation involving a Hausa commercial motorcyclist and a mechanic on Friday. Ojo said the motorcyclist reportedly rode recklessly and nearly hit the mechanic who was walking along Sabo-Oja Oba Road. He said, “When the mechanic complained about what the okada rider did, there was an exchange of words. The rider rushed to a table belonging to a tea seller, picked a knife and attacked the mechanic. “In retaliation, the mechanic hit the rider with an iron rod and he slumped. I don’t know whether he died or not. Other Hausa men in the area rushed to the scene and attempted to attack the Yoruba mechanic. Some hoodlums who were also around the area, also rushed down and it became a free-for-all.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
