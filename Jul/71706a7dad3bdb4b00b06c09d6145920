The Mashi Local Government Area chapter of the All Progressives Congress in Katsina State has asked the member representing Mashi/ Dutsi Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Mansur Mashi, to resign for allegedly abusing the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, (retd). The party said he might be recalled if he failed to do so. The Chairman of the APC chapter, Armaya’u Doka, who spoke at a press conference, also called on  on the National Assembly to suspend the member for the untoward comment. Doka said, “The honourable said ‘Buhari had to leave the scene the way the late (late ex-president) Yar’Adua did,’ so that his vice, Yemi Osinbajo, would take over, and that such is the only way Nigeria could make progress at before 2023. “The audio of what the lawmaker said is out there for all to listen to. By the grace of God, the APC will win in the 2023 general elections and the party will continue to grow stronger in followership. “We call on the APC at the state and national level to call him to order and the National Assembly (to) suspend him for making such comments. “If our call is not heeded to, we, as members of his constituency, have the right to take necessary action that is within the law.” The party chairman said the lawmaker had described the APC as a party that “had lost followership.” He added, “He said that our great party, the APC is like a football team, Barcelona and Madrid. Once the match is over everyone goes his way. That APC may not win in the next general elections.”
