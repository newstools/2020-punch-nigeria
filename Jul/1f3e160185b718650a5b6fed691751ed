Toni Ufoh Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes says Odion Ighalo is one of the quality players at Old Trafford. Ighalo joined Manchester United on loan from Chinese Premier League club Shanghai Shenhua in January and has made a big impact at the former English champions. The Nigerian has netted in each of his first four starts for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. So far Ighalo has scored five goals in 14 games since he joined the club. “We have a lot of quality on the bench – Odion (Ighalo) scored in the cup against Norwich and we also have players like Dan James, Jesse (Lingard), Juan (Mata), Chongy (Tahith Chong),” Fernandes told the club’s official website. “So, we know when we’re tired and we need some freshness, we have a lot of players for the end of the season. It’s easy to play with this kind of players.” Ighalo will look to make his 10th Premier League appearance for United in Monday’s  (today) Premier League clash versus Southampton Meanwhile, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hinted he will name an unchanged side for a fifth consecutive Premier League match when the Saints visit Old Trafford. “There are so many things you have to consider when you manage a team,” Solskjaer, whose side are unbeaten in 17 games across all competitions, said. “We’ve got players here champing at the bit, but also those that are in the rhythm.” Victory at Old Trafford will strengthen Manchester United’s Champions League aspirations, as they battle Chelsea and Leicester City for the final two remaining top-four places.
