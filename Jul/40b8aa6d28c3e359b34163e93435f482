Peter David, Benin City The Convener, Midwest Movement, Dr Don-Pedro Obaseki, on Thursday accused the candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the September 19 governorship election in Edo State, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, of plagiarising his campaign manifesto, the SIMPLE agenda. Obaseki, in a statement titled, ‘Pedro Obaseki insists Ize-Iyamu stole SIMPLE Agenda,’ vowed to retrieve the intellectual property. He said he first publicly unveiled the SIMPLE agenda in August 2015 during a live programme on BENTV UK, where he presented his six-pronged campaign manifesto as an aspirant in the 2016 governorship election in Edo State. He said, “My SIMPLE idea is an acronym for Security and Social Welfare; Infrastructural Development and Urban Renewal; Manpower Development and Training; Public-Private Partnership; Leadership by Example and Employment for Edo Youths. This is the same as what the pastor and his followers are parading online today. “So, I state categorically that I would be commencing processes for retrieving my intellectual property, as it is obvious that the idea did not originate from those who are pushing on with it today.” Ize-Iyamu had on Monday unveiled his six-point programme of action for the state tagged SIMPLE agenda. In his reaction to Obaseki’s claim, the Chairman of the Edo State APC Media Campaign Council, Mr John Mayaki, said he would get back, but did not as of the time of filing the report. Copyright PUNCH.
