Leke Baiyewu, Abuja Twenty-nine Nigerians evacuated by the Federal Government from Lebanon arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja on Saturday afternoon. They were received by officials of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons and the House of Representatives Committee on Diaspora Affairs, among others. Among them is a 31-year-old Nigerian lady, Temitope Arowolo, who was being prosecuted in Lebanon over alleged theft and attempted murder. Another is Peace Busari, who was offered for sale on Facebook for $1000 by a Lebanese, Wael Jerro. Arowolo, in a brief interaction with journalists, said Lebanon was like a hell for her. She cautioned Nigerians, especially girls, who embark on trips in search of greener pastures outside Nigeria. She said, “I’m happy being home. Going to Lebanon is like (going to) a hell. Nobody knows that will happen there. I advise other girls to stay here in Nigeria and try to make it the way the Lord puts them through, because going outside there was like a hell, not only in Lebanon. What I experienced in Lebanon, I pray even not for Satan to experience it.” Arowolo’s employer had accused her of stealing $5,000 and attempting to kill him. Her prosecution in court had been stalled as the accusers failed to show up, while she was granted bail. The committee had, however, said it was established that Arowolo suffered abuse and sexual harassment from the husband of her employer, Mahmoud Zahran, during her sojourn in Lebanon.
