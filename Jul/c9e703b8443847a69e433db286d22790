John Charles  Makurdi The police in Benue State say they have  intensified search to recover the bodies of the 28  persons missing in the Sunday boat accident on River Benue in Makurdi, the state capital. The spokesperson for the command, DSP, Catherine Anene, said three corpses had so far been recovered. Our correspondent gathered that the victims were mostly children of policemen, who were members of the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA). The victims were said to be on their way to an annual conference of the church when the boat capsised around Ijaha community. Our correspondent who visited the barracks, where their parents live on Monday, gathered that a family lost triplets (two boys and a girl), while another lost five family members in the accident. The District Church Council Secretary of ECWA, Rev. Benjamin Dooga, who led all pastors of the district to commiserate with the families said, “The church believes God is supreme and no human can question his authority. Since we are human, we cannot understand what has happened, but He understands.” The pastor said 26 youths were involved aside from the two boat paddlers. Meanwhile, Governor Samuel Ortom in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, on Monday sympathised with the families of the victims. The statement read in parts, “The Governor urges members of Kwaghter community, where the incident took place, to cooperate with the police rescue team to enable them find the missing persons.” Copyright PUNCH.
