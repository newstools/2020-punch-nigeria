Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka has committed himself to the club by signing a new long-term contract. The 18-year-old, who came through the club’s academy, has made a major impact during the current season after making his debut in the Europa League in 2018. Saka tweeted, “London is my home. Arsenal my team. I’m so happy to finally announce my contract extension. “I love playing for this club and I’m looking forward to what the future holds. The hard work continues so I can continue living my dream.” Saka has been a stand-out performer this season for Arsenal, playing 33 times in all competitions. Gunners boss Mikel Arteta told the club website, “Bukayo is a talented and intelligent young player. “He has impressed me with his work ethic and attitude to learn and adapt, and it has paid off in his performances. I am excited to continue working with him to develop him further, and for him to help us achieve our goals.” Saka has continued to impress, predominantly in a wing-back role, since he made his Premier League debut at the age of 17 in the 4-1 win over Fulham last season. The Gunners were under increasing pressure to tie him to the Emirates Stadium following reported interest from Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund.
