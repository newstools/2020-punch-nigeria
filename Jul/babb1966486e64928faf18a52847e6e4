Toni Ufoh The Confederation of African Football has hailed former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Ndubuisi Egbo, after he guided Albania’s KF Tirana to the league title in their centenary year. CAF on its Twitter commended the 2000 and 2002 African Cup of Nations keeper for the work he did with the Albania club, stating that he made history as one of the few African managers who made their mark in European football. “At a period when talks about the low presence of black managers across major European leagues is dominating headlines, Nigeria-born Ndubuisi Egbo’s breakthrough as the first African to win a league title in Europe,” CAF tweeted. The former Eagles goalkeeper, who joined Tirana in 2019, also told ESPN that he is still dazed by his team’s performance. “It’s unexplainable,” Egbo told ESPN. “I am still trying to let it sink in because I didn’t know how huge the success of what God used us to do was until I started hearing I’m the first African coach to achieve this feat. Many people from Nigeria, Egypt – where I played before – and other places have been reaching out,” Egbo added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
