Tony Okafor, Awka Retirees in Anambra State have asked the state government to adjust their pensions to reflect the new minimum wage approved by the Federal Government in 2019. In a petition to the Anambra State House of Assembly obtained by our correspondent on Wednesday, the pensioners, who retired mostly in 2011 said their pensions which were based on the economic indices of about 10 years were no longer sustaining them. They appealed to the lawmakers to prevail on Governor Willie Obiano to follow the law on the harmonisation of pensions.

More importantly, the accumulated arrears of the pension gap paid from May 2011,” they said.
