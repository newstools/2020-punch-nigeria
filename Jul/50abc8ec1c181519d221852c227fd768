Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government is to build a concrete bridge over the Wase Waterways in Wase Local Government Area of Plateau State as replacement for the recently collapsed Wase Bridge in the state. Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, disclosed this in Abuja when he met with the Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong. In a statement issued on Tuesday by the ministry’s Director, Press and Public Relations, Boade Akinola, the minister stated the government would provide a short term relief to facilitate movement among communities disconnected as a result of the collapse. He told the governor that the temporary relief would be undertaken by the Federal Controller of Works in Plateau State, in collaboration with the state government and chairman of Wase Local Government. Fashola said the new concrete bridge would be a long term solution to the perennial problem which the bridge had suffered as a result of heavy rainfall. The ministry explained that the design of the bridge would take his ministry’s team about eight weeks to complete, adding that the final implementation of the concrete bridge plan would depend on the availability of fund. Fashola said the collapse of the bridge was as a result of a downpour and commended the state governor for his quick response to the natural disaster. On his part, Lalong thanked the minister for scheduling the meeting within a short notice and assembling the relevant departments with the view to finding solution to the problem. Copyright PUNCH.
