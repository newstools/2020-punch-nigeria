Dayo Ojerinde A group, Initiative for Fostering Unity in Diversity Youths and Nation Building, has unveiled a new reality show tagged, ‘Naija Unity House’, to promote national unity. The President of the group, Mr Cletus Ebhodaghe, at a briefing on Thursday, said the show, which would start in February, 2021, would bring 37 young Nigerians, drawn from the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory together and house them for 60 days to interact and exchange ideas. He said, “Nigerians have not really utilised the advantages of the nation’s diversity. ‘Naija Unity House’ is here to provide the missing link in our quest to become one united, indivisible nation. We are about to bring 37 Nigerian youths from diverse cultures, creed, tribes and tongues to reside in a unity house for 60 days to learn from one another and build their future and destiny.” The Secretary of the group, Mrs Beauty Cletus, said the show would go a long way in promoting the spirit of oneness and brotherhood in Nigeria, irrespective of culture and social background.
