Alexander okere A governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ondo State, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, has said the party will end the reign of the ruling All Progressives Congress in the October 10 election. Jegede, who was the candidate of the PDP in the 2016 governorship election, alleged that the ruling All Progressives Congress had performed poorly and was losing its popularity in the state, which he said had given the opposition a good chance to take over. The former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, in a statement on Saturday, also stated that the internal crisis in the APC and the number of aspirants contesting the governorship ticket with Governor Rotimi Akeredolu was a clear indication of a vote of no confidence in the governor’s administration by APC members and the majority of the residents of the state. “Democracy is about choice; the people determine who will govern them. The populace will have to weigh their options, whether their lives have improved in the last three and a half years, whether the economy has improved, whether security has improved and whether the educational system has improved.
