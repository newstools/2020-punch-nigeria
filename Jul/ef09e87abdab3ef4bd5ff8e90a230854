Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Rivers State Government said on Tuesday that it would not allow any harm befall the immediate past acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Dr Joi Nunieh, with regards to the ongoing probe of the agency. The state government, in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, expressed concerns over recent developments in the interventionist agency. The statement read in part, “The Rivers State Government has viewed with concern the recent developments at the NDDC in which the name of our daughter, Dr Joi Nunieh, the immediate past acting Managing Director of the commission, has been dragged into. “We hereby call on those involved in the ongoing investigation of the NDDC to ensure that Dr Joi Nunieh does not suffer any harm in the course of their undertaking.” “We wish to state categorically that the Rivers State Government will never support any action that will prevent or jeopardise the laudable intentions of President Muhammadu Buhari to positively reposition the NDDC and fulfil the yearnings and aspirations of the people of the Niger Delta. “However, we wish to state that while we are not interested in identifying with the present unfolding drama in the NDDC; we will not, however, fail to protect our daughter from actual harm or perceived danger. “The state owes it as a duty to protect her citizens from danger no matter their political affiliation, and we cannot fold our arms and watch anyone harm her or indeed any Rivers citizen. We advise those involved in the present altercations in the NDDC to thread with caution in their actions and utterances.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
