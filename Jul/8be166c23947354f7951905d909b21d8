Patrick Odey, Uyo The Akwa Ibom State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has decried the appointment of non-party members by the Federal Government. It accused the federal government of making appointments without the knowledge of the party’s hierarchy to the detriment of party members who sacrificed their time and resources. This was contained in a statement signed by the state APC Publicity Secretary, Nkereuwem Eyongkere, in Uyo on Wednesday. Eyongkere said, the state party chairman, Ini Okopido, forwarded a petition to the presidency on the issue. He said, “The State Chapter in the said letter, lamented that even in the second term of the administration, President Muhammadu Buhari, which the party had expected to benefit from the robust relationship of 2019 elections and for obvious reasons, that he will learn from the mistakes of his first term, but unfortunately, the news of every new appointment from Akwa Ibom State has been so nerve wracking and disquieting to the members of APC in the State, thus weakening the threshold of our party in the state as genuine members who have sacrificed their useful resources are completely cheated out. “The letter underscored among such political appointments, that of Mr. Oboro Effiong Akpabio, Ambassador designate, as one of the persons the party is not very sure if he is from the state as he is unknown to the party and its members. “The letter noted if such trend is not discontinued, will surely discourage members from giving their best to make APC work in Akwa Ibom State and thereby hampering the build up towards 2023.” Copyright PUNCH.
