James Abraham, Jos Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State and members of his family have again tested negative for COVID-19. The governor and members of his family were in April confirmed negative after they were tested for the virus. But last week, his Commissioner for Commerce and Industry, Mr Abe Aku, as well as Chief of Staff, Mr Noel Donjour, tested positive for COVID-19, a development which made the governor and members of his family to subject themselves for another round of test. The latest results which came out on July 4, also turned out to be negative, according to a statement on Monday by the Governor’s Director of Press and Public Affairs, Dr Macham Makut. The statement quoted the governor as saying, “I have continued to encourage people to subject themselves to Covid-19 test. Submitting myself and family to another test was necessary as part of leadership by example and also responding to the recent cases of one of my commissioners and Chief of Staff who were confirmed positive.” Copyright PUNCH.
