Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Bridge Concept Limited, an indigenous firm, has said it is setting up entrepreneurship laboratories to train about 1,000 micro, small and medium enterprises. The Chief Executive Officer of the firm, Bimbo Daramola, said the empowerment initiative, tagged ‘Project 60:60:60’, would create 37 entrepreneurship laboratories across the country. He disclosed this in Abuja at the Nigeria 60th Independence Anniversary Pre-Boot Camp Conversation organised by the firm. Daramola said in the laboratories, entrepreneurs would acquire skills in inventories, marketing, planning and business development. “At the 37 entrepreneurship laboratories across the country, we will ensure that 1,000 people get trained, whether they are educated or not,” he said. He said the initiative would help reduce the rate of unemployment in Nigeria and add value to the 60th anniversary of the country. Daramola said, “Nigeria will be 60 years and the question that comes to mind is: what will be the significance of that anniversary? “It is through such anniversaries that most nations optimise their milestones, and Nigeria should not be left behind.” He said 60 entrepreneurs would be raised from each of the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria through the initiative in a boot camp by the firm. The beneficiaries, according Daramola, will be taught different skills and be equipped with the right capacities as entrepreneurs. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
