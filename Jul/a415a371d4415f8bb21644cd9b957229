We employed him as Director of our Islamic Propagation Center in Owerri financed by the then Baba Adinni of Yorubaland, Alhaj MKO Abiola, before he was employed by INEC where he retired a few months ago. “Due to his dynamism and honesty, he was employed as the Director of Administration of NSCIA. We spoke on Monday where he complained of chronic ulcer and I advised him to use some very efficacious herbal concoctions, unknown to me that it would be our last discussion. “Yusuf is one of the most dedicated brothers from the East of Nigeria, dynamic and humble to a fault. Oh Allah, you know why you are taking away the best among us but we beseech you to be merciful on us and halt this trend. “May Allah forgive his shortcomings and admit him to jannat Firdaus. Make his family steadfast on the noble religion of Islam.”
