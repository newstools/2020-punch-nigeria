Ada Wodu, Calabar The two factional chairmen of the Cross River State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, John Ochala and Etim John, have resolved to bury the hatchet, close ranks, and work for the victory of the party in the forthcoming Northern Senatorial District and Obudu State Constituency by-elections in the state. The two men, in a joint statement they signed in Abuja on Tuesday to that effect after a stakeholders’ meeting, acknowledged the crises that had rocked the party for quite some time and resolved to make peace. In the statement titled, ‘Joint Statement by Sir John Ochala and Honourable Etim Godwin John on the Way Forward for Cross River State All Progressives Congress’, the two men who had been in the trenches said, “Our great party, the All Progressives Congress Cross River State chapter, has for a long while been embroiled in the factionalisation of the party. “We have in the interest of the party resolved that the two factions are now united as one indivisible body to foster the party’s interest in the state.” The party also resolved that “the forthcoming Senatorial district and state House of Assembly by-elections is uppermost in our minds and have resolved to work for credible and acceptable candidates that will give us the much-needed victory in the by-elections.’’ The party advised all chapters to work together particularly the Cross River State Northern Senatorial District chapters to bring about victory in the forthcoming by-elections. It said the modalities for harmonising the state executives shall be made known to the party faithful after the forthcoming by-elections in Cross River North and called on “all party faithful and loyalists to exercise restraint and be patient as we trust God for peaceful co-existence amongst all members of the All Progressives Congress.” The crises that had rocked the party for over five years robbed it of victory in last year’s general elections and the local government election held on May 30 this year.
