Raphael Ede, Enugu Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State on Sunday directed the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Miletus Eze, to liaise with the state police command to ensure that the couple who brutalised a 10-year-old house help with hot iron is brought to justice. The PUNCH had reported that the couple, Mr Jude Ozougwu and Ifeoma, was arrested for torturing Nneoma Nnadi. But a statement on Sunday by the Commissioner for Information, Mr Chidi Aroh, said the governor had approved the award of scholarship, up to university level, to the little girl, as well as instructed the justice commissioner to ensure justice in the matter. It read in part, “In addition to the earlier directive to the State Ministry of Gender Affairs and Social Development to provide and fully pay for the best available medical care for the child, the governor has further directed the immediate release of financial support to the family of the child for their upkeep.” Copyright PUNCH.
