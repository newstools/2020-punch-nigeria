Ada Wodu, Calabar Supporters of the Cross-River State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, under the aegis of Movement for the Restoration of Cross River PDP, have called for the suspension of Governor Ben Ayade, and five others, for taking the party to court over the last state party congress. Others who joined Ayade in instituting the case include Pastor Otu Edet Marshall, Mr Terence Orok, Raphael Stephen Ntui and Henry Ekpenyong Edem. They went to court to challenge the inauguration of ward and local government executive committees. Coordinator of the group, Raymond Takon, said this, in Calabar, on Thursday. He alleged that the litigants were sponsored by the state party Chairman, Edim Inok, through the office of the governor, arguing that the claimants/applicants could not muster the resources to take the party to court. Takon said, “We were aware that the party chairman, working for the governor, has been shopping for a court to obtain an injunction to restrain the authentic ward and local government executive committees from functioning at least to cause chaos and ensure that duly elected committees don’t take part in the pending state congress and primary election for the northern senatorial district by-election. “We call on the national party leadership to take drastic action against the state leadership led by Ntufam Inok by sanctioning all those who took the party to court and their sponsors.” The Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Publicity, Mr Christian Ita, said, “The governor is too preoccupied with the issues of governance, especially in the areas of industrialising Cross River, to be distracted by jobless busy bodies that are clearly on the fringes of ignorance.” Copyright PUNCH.
