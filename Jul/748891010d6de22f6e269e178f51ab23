Wale Oyewale, Ibadan Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, on Wednesday, ordered the execution of a drainage master plan under the  Ibadan Urban Flood Management Project within the next 18 months. This came as some residents of Ibadan suffered losses following a five-hour downpour that caused flooding on Tuesday in parts of the metropolis, including Garage Olodo, Ikumapayi, Oke Omi, Omi River and Sawmill. The governor gave the directive during an on-the-spot assessment visit to the affected areas. He said, “There is a drainage master plan for Oyo State under the Ibadan Urban Flood Management Project; this has been identified and I think we have to keep taking them out one at a time. “By the time we are able to get all the projects under the IUFMP executed, the issues of flood will be dealt with and it is only then that the rainy season will not be any problem for us. “It is work in progress and I believe that in the next 18 months, there will be appreciable improvement and our people can sleep with their eyes closed.” Copyright PUNCH.
