Friday Olokor, Abuja A civil rights group, Resource Centre for Human Rights and Civic Education, on Monday, expressed concern over the rampant cases of multiple taxation. The organisation therefore appealed to the federal and state governments to act more responsibly by showing empathy and support to Nigerians, rather than make life more unbearable with harsh policies. The Executive Director of CHRICED, Dr Ibrahim Zikirullahi, made the call during a press conference on the state of the nation. According to him, based on the numerous taxes and charges besides the worsening economy occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, Nigerians can no longer breathe. Zikirullahi said the insensitive posture of government was the reason behind the decisions of profiteers in the private sector, especially banks, electricity and telecoms companies, to also squeeze Nigerians through arbitrary charges. He said, “To show how insensitive, callous and less concerned the government has been, this is the time it has chosen to hike fuel (PMS) price, and impose levies for other critical services. “At the last count, there have been unjust, and unpopular moves to hike electricity tariffs, raise the fares for train services, and impose a six percent stamp duty for transactions relating to rent payment.” Copyright PUNCH.
