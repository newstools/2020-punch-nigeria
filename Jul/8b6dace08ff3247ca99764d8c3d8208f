Joseph Olaoluwa Wema Bank says it has stopped processing ‘Forms M’ for the importation of maize. The bank said this in a statement received via email on Monday titled “Update from CBN: Importation of Maize/corn.” It added that the step was taken in compliance with the directive by the Central Bank of Nigeria stopping the release of foreign exchange for maize imports. According to the bank, the action is expected to boost local production of the crop.Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
