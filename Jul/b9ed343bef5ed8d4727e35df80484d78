John Alechenu and   Bola Bamigbola The Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress on Thursday met separately with the APC National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; and a former interim National Chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande. The committee was lead by Buni; its secretary, Senator Akpan Udoedehe; and Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello. The Chairman of the Progressives Governors’ Forum and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, was also on the team, accompanied to Tinubu by the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Similarly, the committee, accompanied by Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, met behind closed doors with Akande in his Ila country home, Osun State. The meeting, which lasted about one hour, reportedly dwelled on the assignment given to the committee. Receiving his guests, Akande was said to have advised them to discharge their duties dispassionately and without fear or favour. Asked for details of what Akande told his guests and their responses, an aide to the ex-Osun State governor, Lani Baderinwa, said the meeting was held behind closed doors. However, a source at Akande’s residence said the visit was meant to intimate the ex-governor of the committee’s plans.
