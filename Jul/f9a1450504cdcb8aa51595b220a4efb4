FRIDAY OLOKOR The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, on Saturday, said it was considering 21 herbal products for the treatment of COVID-19 symptoms. In a statement by its Director-General, Prof Mojisola Adeyeye, the agency also described reports circulating on social media that the agency had approved Paxherbal for treating COVID-19 symptoms as “wrong and inaccurate.” She said, “Paxherbal applied for Listing of Pax Herbal Cugzin capsule 290mg, which was approved by NAFDAC and listed as ‘safe to use.’ The applicant claimed that it is an immune booster and an anti-infective. “However, as part of the labelling of the product, and in line with global practices, a disclaimer is on the product label, which clearly states that the claims have not been evaluated by NAFDAC. “Therefore, the statements circulating on social media that NAFDAC has approved Paxherbal product specifically for treating symptoms associated with the coronavirus is wrong and inaccurate. “Until a clinical study is done in a scientific manner, no herbal medicine manufacturer can claim effectiveness to treat COVID-19 associated symptoms. NAFDAC is currently processing 21 herbal medicinal products for ‘safe to use’ or listing status.” The statement further read, “Many of the applicants claim that their products are immune boosters and anti-infectives useful for the relief of symptoms that could be associated with COVID-19. However, no clinical study has been done yet on any of the products to prove their claim of efficacy.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
