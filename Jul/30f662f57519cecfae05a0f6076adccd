Joseph Olaoluwa Aviation unions on Tuesday jointly opposed the planned concession of four airports by Federal Government. The General Secretary of National Union of Air Transport Employees, Ocheme Aba, questioned the veracity of the Certificate of Compliance issued to the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, by the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission. Speaking on behalf of the Air Transport Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, the Association of Nigerian Aviation Professionals and the Nigerian Union of Pensioners during a joint press briefing, Aba accused Sirika of side-stepping the Project Delivery Team and going on to concession the airport on his own.
