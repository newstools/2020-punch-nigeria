Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State Government says it has commenced palliative works on the long abandoned Ojodu-Abiodun-Akute in the Ifo Local Government area of the state. The government also promised to reconstruct and not just rehabilitate the 4.65-kilometre stretch of road at the end of the rainy season. The Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Ade Akinsanya, stated this shortly after inspecting palliative work on the road. Adesanya said the palliative work currently going on in the area was just a temporary measure to reduce the hardship being experienced by road users. Akinsanya also disclosed that aside the 4.65-kilometre Ojodu Abiodun/Akute road,  the road coming from Sango to Akute would also be worked on. He said, “This road is a vital road. This road linking us (Ogun State) with Lagos State is part of the economic linkage this administration is trying to revitalise in this area.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
