Olalekan Adetayo and Gbenga Odogun The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Sunday felicitated with a former Minister of Police Affairs, Major General David Jemibewon (retd.), who turns 80 today (Monday). Buhari’s congratulatory message was contained in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina. The statement was titled, “President Buhari greets Maj. Gen. David Jemibewon at 80.” The statement read in part, “President Buhari extols Maj. Gen. Jemibewon for services to the nation, as a former governor of the defunct Western State, and later Oyo State, and taking up strategic positions in the Nigerian Army as General Officer Commanding First Infantry Division and as Adjutant General. “President believes Maj. Gen. Jemibewon’s interest in the country continued to soar after retirement as he contributed to the process of returning the country to democratic governance, and has consistently played an active role in advocating good governance and development that directly impact on the people.” Also, the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, in a similar message, in Lokoja on Sunday, joined several Nigerians to celebrate the elder statesman. In a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Onogwu Mohammed, Bello was quoted as describing him as a rare gem and a great gift. The governor also said, “His patriotic zeal for the nation took him into the Nigerian Army in 1960 where he served in various capacities as he distinguished himself in all and rose to the enviable rank of a Major General.” Copyright PUNCH.
