Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin At least 35 doctors have so far tested positive for coronavirus in Kwara State since the virus manifested in the state. Speaking with journalists on Monday at the 2020 Annual General Meeting of the Nigeria Medical Association in Ilorin, the chairman of the association, Dr Kolade Solagberu, however, said the association had not recorded any casualty among its members. The NMA chairman, who cautioned residents of the state that COVID-19 is real, added that they should disregard rumours saying the pandemic was only a money-making avenue for the government. He said, “Residents should help the doctors to help them by not paying unnecessary visits or consultations to hospitals. “For now, people should avoid visiting the hospital except for life-threatening issues. We advise people to engage in e-health service instead of physical consultation to avoid contact as much as possible. “People should stop unnecessary visits to patients in the hospital. Those who follow patients waiting to be attended to are not encouraged for now. “You should just help us to help you because the less the number of patients we attend to, the less the chances of spreading the virus. This is because every patient is a potential COVID-19 case.” Kwara has recorded over 400 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including 179 recoveries and 14 fatalities
