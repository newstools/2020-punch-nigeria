Tony Okafor, Awka Traditional rulers in Anambra Central Senatorial District on Thursday voted against zoning of the Anambra governorship seat in 2021. The decision was taken at a meeting at the palace of the traditional ruler of Ukwulu in the Dunikofia Local Government Area of the state, Igwe Peter Uyanwa. It was gathered that the meeting which had some stakeholders of the district in attendance, was convened in response to the raging debate over zoning. This was coming a few days after the traditional rulers of Anambra South Senatorial District led by Igwe Nwafor Orizu of Nnewi expressed support for the proposal to zone the governorship position to Anambra south. But the traditional and political leaders of Anambra Central on Thursday said it was undemocratic to ask aspirants from other sections of the state to quit the race. They dissociated themselves from any zoning arrangement for the 2021 governorship election. “Zoning ended with the incumbent administration as every zone of the state has taken turns to lead Anambra since 1999. Credibility of candidate and capacity to deliver good governance is more paramount to us than zoning,” a communique issued after the meeting read. They said the central forum would only accept and encourage any credible governorship candidate that was ready and capable of delivering the dividend of democracy to the people of Anambra State.
