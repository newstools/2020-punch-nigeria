Wale Oyewale, Ibadan A wanted notorious gang leader, Biola Ebila, has been reportedly murdered in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. It was gathered that Ebila was killed in a crossfire at the Olomi area of the city on Sunday, following a clash between two rival groups. The police later moved to the area to quell the hostility. Ebila had been declared wanted by the police for his alleged involvement in the murder of a rival gang leader, Ekugbemi, in May. Residents of the area had since been under fear of reprisal by the Ekugbemi boys. In a telephone interview with our correspondent, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Olugbenga Fadeyi, said information on the incident was still sketchy. “Our men have been dispatched in the area to investigate the incident. When properly briefed, we shall be able to give a detailed account of what actually happened. For now, I cannot tell you much,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
