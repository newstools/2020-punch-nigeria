The Federal Government, through the N-Power office, had stated that it would absorb 400,000 applicants as Batch C beneficiaries. The humanitarian ministry’s Deputy Director, Information, Rhoda Iliya, said, “Enrolment of beneficiaries for N-power Batch C commenced on June 26, 2020 and has received over three million applications since the portal opened. “The application process will be concluded as soon as possible to provide additional Nigerian youths access to the programme.” The NSIP was inaugurated by the government in 2016 with the mandate of lifting citizens out of poverty through a number of social interventions.
