Adelani Adepegba, Abuja A former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, has denied campaigning for the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), while serving as ex-President Goodluck Jonathan’s NSA. Dasuki said this in a statement on Sunday titled, ‘I never campaigned for APC or Buhari as NSA to President Jonathan’. He said, “The truth is that I was involved in an attempt at forging an alliance between the Action Congress of Nigeria, All Nigeria Peoples Party and the Congress for Progressive Change, among others, prior to the 2011 elections, which was not successful. “My involvement in that political process ended after the elections of 2011. “At the point of accepting the appointment to serve as the National Security Adviser in 2012, I made clear to President Jonathan that I had relationships with General Muhammadu Buhari of the CPC, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu of the ACN and Chief Ogbonnaya Onu of the ANPP, among other opposition elements and that my appointment would not cause me to sever the relationship.
