Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta Men of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Ogun State Command, have intercepted over 300 fuel-laden sacks abandoned by suspected vandals. The fuel was reportedly scooped from the pipelines belonging to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in Akute, in the Ifo Local Government Area of the state. The Public Relations Officer of the NSCDC in the state, Dyke Ogbonnaya, disclosed this on Friday in a statement. He said, “The 300 sacks of PMS which contained 100 litres each were lying afloat when the men got to the scene. The team also recovered a white bus with registration number, Lagos, KTU607XK during the operation.” Ogbonnaya said the recovered bus was loaded with several empty 50-litre jerry cans abandoned by the vandals still at large. He said the state Commandant of the NSCDC, Mr Hammed Abodunrin, visited the scene for an on-the-spot assessment. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
