Tobi Aworinde The Deputy Governor of Edo State, Phillip Shaibu, on Saturday, criticised a former deputy speaker of the state House of Assembly, Festus Ebea, over comments the latter allegedly made on the 2024 governorship election. Shaibu, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Benjamin Atu, described Ebea’s purported comments as “sickening and unacceptable,” while accusing the former deputy speaker of absconding from his duty post. He said, “Festus Ebea is not my friend and we do not belong to the same school of thought. I belong to the school of thought representing the people when voted for. I did not abscond from my duty post like he did when he was voted for in his constituency. He should check my record and his record. “I am not like them that will want to play God and decide what will happen in two or three years from now. No man can determine what will happen tomorrow, except God.” “He should speak about himself. He should not speak for me. Festus Ebea should face his principal, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
