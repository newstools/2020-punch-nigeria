Peter Dada, Akure Following the abduction and death of a 13-year-old girl at Eshe Akoko in the Akoko North West Local Government Area of Ondo State, some youths in the town have burnt down the house of the suspect arrested in connection with the crime. The girl, who was a pork seller in the town, was allegedly kidnapped on Friday and her body was later found in the bush. It was gathered that a commercial motorcyclist in the town, whose identity has not been revealed, conveyed the teenager from the market in Irun Akoko to Eshe Akoko, but she later disappeared and her corpse was recovered from the bush on Saturday. Following the incident, men of the state police command arrested the motorcyclist. Angered by the incident, the youth attacked the house of the suspect and set it ablaze, while a car and other valuables found on the building were also vandalised. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, confirmed the incident and said the suspect was in custody and that investigation had commenced into the incident. “We have commenced investigation into the matter,” Ikoro said.
