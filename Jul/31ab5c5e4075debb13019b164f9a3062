Patrick Odey, Uyo Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, says his government will not rush to reopen schools because other states are doing the same. He also lifted the ban on wedding and burial ceremonies in the state but emphasised that Covid-19 protocols be observed at both functions. Emmanuel, who spoke in a broadcast on Thursday night, said the State Executive Council would meet soon to review the reopening of schools, adding that schools would remain shut should the committee found it unsafe for resumption. He said, “Akwa Ibom will not copy anybody and rush to reopen schools. This is not the time to copy anybody, you must localise your own situation. If after our assessment we see that we cannot open our schools the same time as others, we will keep the schools closed.
