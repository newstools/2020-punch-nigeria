Dayo Ojerinde The Special Adviser to the Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie, has said the ex-national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, is disappointed because Governor Godwin Obaseki refused to be used in his quest to become a godfather in the state. Osagie, in a statement on Monday, said the vituperation by Oshiomhole was just an expression of his frustration over his failure to achieve his goal to govern Edo State for a third term using Obaseki as a proxy. “In 2016 when Oshiomhole nominated and supported Obaseki, his hidden motive was  to use Governor Obaseki. who he thought would be a pawn in his game to defraud Edo people and enthrone himself as the ultimate godfather of Edo politics at the expense of the will and wishes of Edo people.
