Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The United Kingdom group, Catalyst Fund, has announced that two Nigerian firms, WellaHealth and Flex Finance, are to receive about N38.7 million (£80,000) grant capital. The companies will also benefit from a six-month programme from experts of the research, advisory and data analytics firm, BFA Global. The grant is expected to assist them in the provision of affordable healthcare coverage to protect families from the financial shock that comes from unexpected health emergencies, including hospital cash during COVID-19. A statement on Wednesday from the British High Commission said the two Nigerian companies were awarded the grant alongside four other fin-tech startups from Mexico (Mango Life and Graviti), South Africa (PayMeNow) and India (KarmaLife). All six are now part of a cohort of 31 companies from around the world receiving Catalyst Fund support.
