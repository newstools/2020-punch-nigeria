Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa A former Bayelsa State Peoples Democratic Party governorship aspirant, Mr Timi Alaibe, on Thursday accepted the judgment of the Supreme Court which dismissed his appeal challenging the emergence of Governor Douye Diri, as the party’s candidate in the 2019 governorship election. Alaibe, in a statement titled, “Alaibe Vs Others: It Is A Party Affair, Says Supreme Court”, which was signed by his personal assistant, Ogio Enize, said he accepted the verdict in good faith. He also congratulated governor Diri over his victory. He said, “While our supporters may feel justifiably disappointed by the outcome of the case based on the supremacy of the court’s pronouncement, we have accepted it in good faith, however painful. “We feel justified that from the trial court to the apex court, the repulsive processes that led to the primary were never endorsed by any of the courts. “Therefore, in the true spirit of political brotherhood and friendship, irrespective of the uncharitable processes and the outcome of our legal action, Chief Ndutimi Alaibe hereby congratulates and extends his unreserved hand of fellowship to Senator Douye Diri on his emergence as the Governor of Bayelsa. Congratulations.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
