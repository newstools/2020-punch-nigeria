Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi The immediate past Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has explained that he dumped the Peoples Democratic Party to join the All Progressives Congress because the mistakes the former administration in Bauchi State made are being repeated by the present administration of Governor Bala Mohammed. Dogara, who represents the Dass, Tafawa Balewa/Bogoro Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, in a letter to the Chairman of the PDP, Bogoro C Ward in the Bogoro Local Government Area of Bauchi State, dated July 24, 2020, said he was leaving the party because of the alleged mismanagement of resources in the state and the outsourcing of payment of workers’ salaries to private consultants. The letter read in part, “Specifically, I intend to ask questions about the following: What has happened to LGA allocations since May 2019? What happened to our campaign promise to conduct LGA election within six months of the PDP government? “What happened to the N4.6bn loan taken from a bank and paid directly into a private company’s account? “Why are we segmenting salaries and why is payment of salaries of state workers outsourced to a private firm as consultants? “Why are contracts inflated, awarded and payment of mobilisation done in violation of extant rules on procurement?” Copyright PUNCH.
