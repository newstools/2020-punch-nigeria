Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Peoples Democratic Party National Campaign Council for the Edo Governorship Election has expressed confidence that Governor Godwin Obaseki will retain his seat. This was as the Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, claimed that the PDP actually won the Edo governorship poll which brought Obaseki to power in 2016. He also said it was not a surprise that Obaseki had returned to the PDP where he rightly belonged. This was contained in a statement by the Rivers State Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, shortly after the inaugural meeting of the council in Port Harcourt on Wednesday. Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, who is the chairman of the council, presided over the meeting which was held behind closed doors. According to the statement, those who attended the meeting were the Governor of Adamawa State, Fintiri, and his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Mankinde, among others. Briefing newsmen after the meeting, Fintiri, who is also the deputy chairman of the council, said, “The election is already on the table for the PDP.  We have a sellable candidate, who is Governor Godwin Obaseki. Nigerians are moving forward with democracy and we have to deepen it together.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
