James Abraham, Jos The Plateau State House of Assembly on Tuesday suspended the Chairmen of  Qua’an-Pan Local Government Area of the state, Mr Isaac Kwallu, and his counterpart in Kanam, Mr Wakdung Abbas. The two council chairmen were suspended by the lawmakers during their plenary. The Speaker of the House, Mr Ayuba Abok, said the two council chairmen were suspended for disregarding the order of the state legislature, adding that their suspension would last for three months. Abok  said, “The state Assembly has directed the local government chairmen to recall the councillors of various wards which they earlier suspended in the two local government areas  but the chairmen refused. “We have no choice but to suspend the two chairmen; although, the Chairman of Quan-Pan complied, it wasn’t convincing.” The Chairman, House Committee on Information, and the member representing Pankshin North, Philip Dasun, after the plenary, said the House had the constitutional power to sanction the two council chairmen for their disobedience to the directive of the Assembly. Dasun dismissed the claim that the suspension of Kwallu was not unconnected with his ambition for the Plateau South senatorial bye election. Kwallu, however, said he would not respond to the suspension because he had not received official communication from the House. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
