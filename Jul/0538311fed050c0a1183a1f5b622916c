Temiloluwa O’Peters The Nigerian Aviation Handling Company’s profit before tax  grew to N1.34bn at the end of 2019, representing 166 per cent increase compared to the end of 2018. The ground handling company said it paid a total of N487m as dividend at 30 kobo per ordinary share of 50 kobo each, as approv¬ed by its shareholders. According to a statement issued by the company on Monday, the Chairman, NAHCO, Dr Seinde Fadeni, stated this on Thursday at the 2019 Annual Reports and Accounts of its virtual Annual General Meeting in Lagos. Fadeni, in his speech, disclosed that  in 2018, the company’s profit before tax was N503.237m but grew to N1.34bn in 2019. He attributed this growth to the several measures put in place during the financial year to control costs and increase revenue by the company. According to him, profit after tax increased significantly from N196.8m in 2018 to N717.2m in 2019, representing 264 per cent increase within the period. He added that the group closed 2019 with total revenue of about N9.99bn, a marginal increase of 2.3 per cent over the 2018 figures of about N9.8bn. The chairman, however, explained that the year would have ended on a better note but the United States – China trade issues and the virus in the Asian country affected importation and reduced flight frequencies at the tail end of 2019. He noted that the initial problems of increased costs of operations and administrative expenses had been taken on board by management and were being released. “The transformation agenda, being facilitated by KPMG, is on course. This transformation agenda includes our five-year strategic plan and this plan is anchored on five strategic pillars and three key enablers,” he said. Fadeni added that the year 2019 was fairly good to the company and that the management was working to win more clients and renew some of its existing contracts from 2019. Copyright PUNCH.
