Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja Wife of the President, Mrs Aisha Buhari, on Wednesday, disclosed that the late Isa Funtua secured different board appointments for female politicians in the last four years. Mrs Buhari disclosed this in her tribute to the late Funtua which she posted on her social media platforms. Funtua, an ally of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), died on Monday in Abuja. During his lifetime, he was one of the power brokers behind Buhari’s regime, leading to him being described as one of the “cabal members.” Funtua; the late former Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari; and the President’s nephew, Mamman Daura; are among the people believed to have a stronghold on Buhari and his regime. Mrs Buhari said Funtua would be remembered for his support to female politicians. She wrote, “Inna lillahi Wa inna ilaihi Raji’un. On behalf of my family, I extend our condolence to Mrs Hauwa Isa Funtua and the entire family on the sudden death of Malam Ismaila Isa Funtua. “We pray that Allah SWT will grant him aljannatul firdaus. “Mallam Ismaila Isa Funtua will be remembered for his support to female politicians, especially his role to get them appointed into different boards in the last four years. “May Allah grant his family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss, Amen”
