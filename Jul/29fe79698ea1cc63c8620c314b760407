Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday struck out the Peoples Democratic Party’s suit challenging the ward, local government and state congresses organised by the Adebayo Dayo-led Ogun State PDP executive committee. Delivering judgment in the suit, Justice Ahmed Mohammed held that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The PDP had in the suit which was amended in May this year, urged the court to nullify the notice issued in February 2020 by the Dayo-led Ogun State executive to organise the planned congresses. In his judgment, Justice Mohammed held that he was unable to make any pronouncement on the issue as another judge, Justice Ibrahim Buba, of the Federal High Court in Lagos, a court of coordinate jurisdiction, had already ruled on the same matter. Mohammed noted that in Justice Buba’s judgment delivered in the suit, marked FHC/L/CS/636/2016 on June 24, 2016, it had already been declared that the Dayo-led executive could conduct the congresses.
