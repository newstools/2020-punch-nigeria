Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Olufon of Ifon in Osun State, Oba Almaroof Magbagbeola, on Wednesday, said the cows killed in his domain by lightning had been buried, but noted that the occurrence was a sign that God was displeased with the world. Seven cows belonging to a Fulani herder, identified simply as Alhaji Abdullahi, were killed by lightning in Elepo, a village under Ifon, in the early hours of Tuesday. Oba Magbagbeola said he saw a sign of the impending calamity around 3am on Tuesday, adding that he was later informed at daybreak that lightning had killed some animals in a village under his domain. The monarch said he immediately directed Sango adherents to proceed to the scene and perform the necessary rites. He added that he directed the owner of the animals to arrange their evacuation and burial before some people would attempt to sell the meat to unsuspecting members of the public. He said, “Selling the animals to people will bring more calamity. It was a huge loss. When the Fulani herders came here to inform me, I tried to pacify them, because the loss is huge. “I also plan to give the owner some money. I told the herders, who came to me, that the whoever ate the meat from the dead cows would die and I didn’t want that in my domain. There are rituals I was told to perform, which I must ensure I do before nightfall. “I told them to bury the animals and I monitored it and they carried out the instruction. We didn’t take the incident with levity. It is an indication that God is displeased with the world. It is like coronavirus. It is a sign of the wrath of God. It is the first time such would happen here in Ifon.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
