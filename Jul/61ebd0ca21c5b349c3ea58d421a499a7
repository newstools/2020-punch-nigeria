Kelvin Ekerete Bordeaux forward, Samuel Kalu, has tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the second Super Eagles star to contract the disease after Genk striker, Paul Onuachu. The Nigerian has been in quarantine in France since returning from the West African nation, and a report from AFP confirmed that Kalu was the player announced by the club to have contracted COVID-19 on July 6. The club did not disclose the name of the infected player when they made the announcement. The winger has missed the team’s training sessions since the opening of camp and might be left out of some of the club’s pre-season games. Kalu, according to reports, is expected to rejoin the rest of the squad on July 27, should he turn in a negative test. His compatriot, Onuachu, who tested positive for coronavirus on July 8, has since been confirmed negative, according to results from his last tests. During the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, Kalu was rushed to hospital on the eve of Nigeria’s opening match after slumping in training. A medical report revealed he suffered from severe dehydration. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
