Chima Azubuike, Gombe Acivil society group in Gombe State has lamented the high rate of malnutrition in the North-Eastern part of the country, describing the trend as pathetic. The spokesman for the group, Mr Alhassan Yahya, said this on Wednesday during a virtual meeting organised by the International Society of Media and Public Health in partnership with the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre. He said, “The National Nutrition and Health Survey 2018, indicated that Nigeria has 2.6 million cases of severe acute malnutrition with North-East carrying the highest-burden of 60 per cent of the cases.” The Chairman, Gombe State House of Assembly Committee on Appropriation, Mr Ali Manu, said Governor Inuwa Yahaya has prioritised health care service delivery in the state, adding that the Assembly had keyed into the priority area of the state government’s health care programmes. “As the chairman, House Committee on Appropriation, I will ensure that funds allocated for nutrition will be adequately increased. The Speaker, Mr Abubakar Sadiq-Kurba, is one of the nutrition advocates in the state, therefore, nobody will tamper with the nutrition allocation,” Manu said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
