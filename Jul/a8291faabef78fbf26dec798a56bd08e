Adelani Adepegba,Abuja THE Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission has declared its former staff member, Gloria Elih, wanted. The anti-graft agency said it had filed criminal charges against Elih before an FCT High Court presided over by Justice Adegbola Adeniyi for allegedly demanding and receiving gratification from officials of Federal Ministry of Water Resources, who were being investigated. The ICPC in a statement on its website on Tuesday stated, “She is declared wanted as all efforts to serve her and procure her attendance in court have proved abortive. “Elih is an indigene of Anambra State and speaks English and Igbo languages fluently. She is 44 years old and dark in complexion. Her last known address is El-Salem Estate in Lugbe, Abuja.” It asked anyone with useful information on her whereabouts to report to ICPC headquarters in Abuja or any of the ICPC state offices or the nearest police station.
