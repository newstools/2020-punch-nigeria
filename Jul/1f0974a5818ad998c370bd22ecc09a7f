Youths of the All Progressives Congress in Ekiti State, on Saturday, said the attack by former Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State on APC chieftains, senators Babafemi Ojudu and Adedayo Adeyeye, were allegedly targeted at seeking the attention of the incumbent, Governor Kayode Fayemi. Fayose had, in a statement by his media aide, Lere Olayinka, alleged that Ojudu and Adeyeye did not have political value and were not wanted in the Peoples Democratic Party, despite their standoff with Fayemi. But the group’s state coordinator, Tenibiaje Babatope, in a statement, said, “Fayose, your advice to Fayemi is unwanted, ill-timed, full of bile and hatred. Leave the APC to solve its own problem in a family way.” It added, “Fayose is not in a position to determine the admission or otherwise of any person to the PDP. He is neither the founder nor the owner of the party. He is the major cause of the current misfortunes of the PDP in the state.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
