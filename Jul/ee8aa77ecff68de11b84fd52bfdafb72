Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri An aide to the former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has described as “COVID-19 infested” a panel report, which indicted the administrations of his principal and that of Emeka Ihedioha for allegedly misappropriating the state’s local government areas’ funds to the tune of N141bn. Okorocha’s media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, said in a statement on Sunday that the panel report was meant to tarnish the ex-governor’s image. The former governor accused the Chairman of the panel, Eze Duruiheoma, of writing the report in his bedroom. The statement read in part, “The report of the panel has nothing to do with Chief Emeka Ihedioha. They brought in his name to deceive the unwary. The panel report is all about Rochas Okorocha and his administration, from May 29, 2011, to May 29, 2019, as it affected the local government areas in the state. “The Chairman of the Panel, Chief Duruiheoma, was a former Chairman of the PDP in Imo State. He was also appointed the chairman of the National Population Commission by the PDP government and removed by the APC government. He is from the same Ideato South Local Government Area with Okorocha. He had had the feeling that Okorocha was behind his removal as the NPC chairman. That was the man, who headed the LG panel against Okorocha and his government. “To us, the report could better be described as ‘Who say men no dey report or garbage in, garbage out, report, or COVID-19 infested report’. The man sat in his bedroom and wrote a report. Otherwise, we challenge him or the government to make public, those who appeared before the panel. At least, the local government chairmen between May 29, 2011 and May 29, 2019, and where the panel sat.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
