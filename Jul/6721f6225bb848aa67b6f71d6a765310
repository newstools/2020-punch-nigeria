Alexander Okere with agency report Pirates have attacked a Norwegian vessel off the coast of Nigeria and kidnapped nine Nigerians. The ship’s Norwegian owner, BW Offshore, disclosed this on Thursday. BW Offshore said in a filing to the Oslo stock exchange that the Sendje Berge, an offshore support vessel for the oil and gas industry, came under attack at 0320 GMT, according to a report on Channels TV’s website. It was learnt there had been no news on the nine Nigerians since they were taken. The Gulf of Guinea, which includes the Nigerian coast, has in recent years been attacked by pirates who loot ships, kidnap crews or passengers for ransom. It was, however, learnt that nobody remaining on board the ship had been hurt, according to the statement. Sendje Berge was working at the Okwori oilfield on behalf of China’s Addax Petroleum as of the time of the attack. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
