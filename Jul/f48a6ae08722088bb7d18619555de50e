Wale Oywwale, Ibadan The Oyo State Government said on Thursday that Muslim praying grounds across the state would be opened for the 2020 Eid-el-Kabir prayers on Friday (today). The state government, however, warned that Muslim faithful must ensure strict compliance with the COVID-19 protocols in the state. According to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Taiwo Adisa, it has become imperative, for the sake of public health and wellbeing of all worshipers, that the Eid prayers are conducted in strict compliance with the guidelines on prevention of COVID-19. The statement read, “The Eid praying grounds across the state have, upon the directive of the Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, been opened to Muslims for the purpose of the 2020 Eid-el-Kabir prayers. “His Excellency reckons that prayers are important to overcome the challenges that presently assail us, especially the COVID-19 pandemic. “However, just like many aspects of our lives that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be an adjustment to Eid prayer gatherings. There is the need to ensure that not more than 25 per cent of worshippers are allowed at every instance in order to ensure compliance with the social distancing rule.” It added that the Emergency Operations Centre of the Oyo State COVID-19 Task Force had notified major markets and shopping malls to ensure strict compliance with the preventive measures.
