Peter David, Benin City Sokoto State Governor and Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party Governors’ Forum, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, his Edo State counterpart and PDP candidate in the September 19 governorship election, Mr Godwin Obaseki, have called on political actors to shun violence and embrace peace in the forthcoming poll. The charge was also re-echoed by the Chairman, Edo PDP Campaign Council, and Deputy Chairman, PDP South-South, Chief Dan Orbih. Speaking to journalists after the party’s stakeholders’ meeting held in Benin City on Thursday, Tambuwal noted, “I am appealing to both sides and also to leaders of the various political parties participating in the governorship election to continue to encourage their supporters to restrain from unleashing mayhem and violence on the electorate. “I appeal to leaders of the various political parties with the interest of Edo State at heart, to speak with their followers and make sure the election is free and fair.” Warning against plans to use security agencies to rig the forthcoming election, Tambuwal added, “We have seen cases where federal might was used in isolated elections in Nigeria through the deployment of security personnel to such a state to intimidate voters, instead of taking them to North-East where the country is facing serious security challenges. This must not be done in Edo State.” On his part, Obaseki said his administration was not weak in responding to political violence, adding that he would resist riging  in the election. Meanwhile, Orbih said the campaign team would commence a tour of the 18 local government areas to meet with Edo electorate to get their blessings for the governor’s re-election bid. Copyright PUNCH.
