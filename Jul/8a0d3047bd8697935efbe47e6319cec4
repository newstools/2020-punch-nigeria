Peter David, Benin City The Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress, on Sunday, accused each other of complicity in the violence, which erupted around the Palace of the Oba of Benin on Saturday. The National Vice-Chairman, South-South, PDP, Chief Dan Orbih, said the incident was an attempt by the opposition to eliminate leaders of his party. Supporters of the two parties engaged in a shootout around the palace shortly after the inauguration of Governor Godwin Obasaki re-election campaign. At least, five persons were said to have sustained varying degrees of injuries during the brawl. At a press briefing in Benin City on Sunday, Orbih, who is the Chairman of the Edo PDP 2020 Campaign Council, said, “The invasion of the palace gate by armed APC youths was a well-coordinated assault by the leadership and sponsors of the Edo APC to eliminate the national leadership of the PDP and all democratically elected governors of the PDP, who were expected to be with the governor.” In response, the state chapter of the APC at a separate press conference addressed by the Vice-Chairman, Media and Publicity Committee, APC National Campaign Council, Mr Patrick Obahiagbon, said it uncovered plans by the state government to detain the immediate past National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, on trumped-up charges. “There is a plan by the Edo State Government to detain a former governor of the state, Adams Oshiomhole, over trumped-up charges on the eve of the election and also set fire on the farm of billionaire businessman, Captain Hosa Okunbo, in continuation of the assault on his reputation and businesses for refusing to back the second-term agenda of Governor Godwin Obaseki,” he said.
