Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo One Jubril Anifowose, on Thursday, appeared before an Osun State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Ile-Ife for allegedly abducting his neighbour’s wife and children. Anifowose was accused of abducting one Kemi, a housewife married to Dotun Elufidipe, and two of her children. The prosecutor, Abdullahi Emmanuel, said Anifowose sometime in 2016 at No. 15 Enuwa Street, Ile-Ife, abducted Kemi and her two children. Emmanuel explained that the defendant knew that Kemi was married to his neighbour, Dotun Elufidipe, but still acted the way he did. He also alleged the defendant exhibited a conduct likely to cause a breach of the public peace and order. The offence, Emmanuel stated, contravened Section 249(d) of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun State, 2002. Anifowose pleaded not guilty to the one count bordering of abduction pressed against him. His counsel, Mrs F. O. Lawal, moved an application for his bail with an assurance that Anifowose would provide reliable sureties. Ruling on the application, the presiding magistrate, A. A. Adebayo, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N100,000 with one surety in like sum. He adjourned the matter till July 30, 2020, for further hearing. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
