Abiodun Nejo The Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress in Ekiti State on Saturday engaged each other in verbal war over the mission of the PDP State Caretaker Committee in Ekiti. While the APC said the opposition party’s caretaker committee was out to destabilise the government and confuse the citizenry through falsehood, cheap blackmail and propaganda, the PDP committee said its coming to Ekiti had been a blessing to the state and its people. APC Director of Media, Sam Oluwalana, in a statement entitled “PDP Caretaker Committee misadventure in Ekiti State,” expressed concern that the PDP might go into oblivion following activities of the caretaker committee which he said was also causing disharmony among the opposition party members. He stated, “The PDP committee members, rather than facing their assignment, are only interested in causing trouble in the state by dishing out lies of high magnitude to the general public. “This is a committee that has not seen anything good in the administration of Dr Kayode Fayemi and APC and rather than embarking on constructive criticism expected of a formidable opposition, it has been tales of lies upon lies. But the Secretary, Ekiti PDP Caretaker Committee, Diran Odeyemi, described the attack by the APC on the opposition party as misdirected, saying, “PDP, as a responsible opposition, has been putting Fayemi on his toes with constructive criticisms geared towards giving the people the best democracy dividends they deserve.
