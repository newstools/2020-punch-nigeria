Ovie Ejaria has extended his loan deal with FC Reading, according to the manager of the side, Mark Bowne, in a post-match conference. The 22-year-old on-loan Liverpool man has been with the Royals since 2019 and his performance for the club has been spectacular this season. The UK-born midfielder, who has committed his international future to Nigeria, has made 35 appearances and scored three goals with four assists for Reading, according to Transfermarkt. Bowen in an interview with Get Reading said, “As far as I’m aware, the five are signed up. Last two we were waiting on were Pele and Ejaria and they both signed up.” Copyright PUNCH.
