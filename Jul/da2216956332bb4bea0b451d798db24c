Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan The Oyo State State Government has said it is working to ensure that its over 40 female indigenes who were sold into slavery in Lebanon are brought back home. The Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Diaspora Affairs, Bolanle Sarumi-Aliyu, said this in an interview with our correspondent in Ibadan on Tuesday. Sarumi-Aliyu said her office was working with the Nigerian Diaspora Commission headed by Abike Dabiri-Erewa to bring back Nigerians trapped on Lebanon and other countries like Dubai, Oman and Saudi Arabia. She said more than 40 females who are indigenes of the state were being used as slaves in various homes in Lebanon adding that arrangements were being made to repatriate them. She said, “We received nine Oyo State indigenes on July 11 and once those who are still there get clearance, the rest can return.” “There are over 40 ladies from Oyo State and over 100 others from various states in Nigeria in Lebanon.” “They use them as slaves there. Some of them work from morning till around midnight. Their masters even seize their passports; so I believe they are being used as slaves.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
