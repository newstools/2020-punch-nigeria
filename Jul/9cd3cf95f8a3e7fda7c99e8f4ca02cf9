Samson Folarin The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has unveiled government’s plan to establish two food production centres in Epe and Badagry to ensure sustained food production and supply in the state. He spoke on Tuesday at the distribution of agricultural inputs and productive assets to 2,743 farmers under the 2020 Agricultural Value Chains Empowerment Programme. Sanwo-Olu explained that the two centres would ensure the expansion and stocking of agricultural production facilities in various value chains. The governor, who was represented by the Deputy Governor, Dr Obafemi Hamzat, said the state would also establish the Lagos Aquaculture Centre of Excellence, a N10bn project to be located on 35 hectares of land in Igbonla, Epe, under a public private partnership arrangement. “It is designed to boost the growth and development of aquaculture industry in the state through the direct production of 2,000 tonnes of fish annually, provision of inputs to fish farmers under the Lagos Nucleus Farms scheme and serve as off-taker for fish farm clusters in the state,” he added. Earlier, the state Acting Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms. Abisola Olusanya, said agriculture was not only a major source of employment for Lagosians, but also vital to the promotion of food security. She said the empowerment scheme was a means of supporting farmers, who were actively engaged in the various agricultural value chains, thereby creating further wealth and job opportunities.
