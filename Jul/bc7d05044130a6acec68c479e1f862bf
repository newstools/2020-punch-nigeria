Kelvin Ekerete Heartland FC coach, Fidelis Ilechukwu, says officials and players of the club are suffering and in dire need of help, after being owed six months’ salary by the management. The Owerri-based club are yet to pay salaries since the turn of the year, a situation that has left players and officials stranded, with some reportedly turning to begging to make ends meet. Ilechukwu, who joined the club from Lagos side MFM FC at the start of the 2019/20 season, appealed to the club management to pay their outstanding six months salaries, saying as their families’ breadwinners, they’ve found it difficult maintaining their households. “We are suffering, our families are suffering, the players are suffering as well. Some of the players’ have kids that are sick and they don’t even have money to take them to the hospital. I am currently in Imo. I can’t go to Lagos because I’m being owed,” Ilechukwu told The PUNCH. “At the moment, Heartland owe the players and officials six months’ salary. Most importantly, I want the club to pay players their salaries and after that, we can sit, strategise and plan ahead of the coming season.” The former national U-23 assistant coach also volunteered to be paid last, preferring the players to be sorted out first. “I have not been paid; my crew has also not been paid as well. I will prefer the management pays the players before paying me because they are the tools we use in getting results. The Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, has promised to pay us, so we are waiting” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
