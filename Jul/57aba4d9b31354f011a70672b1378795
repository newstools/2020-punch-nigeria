John Alechenu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has dismissed allegations levelled against its campaign council by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party as baseless and diversionary. This was contained in a statement signed by its Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yakini Nabena, in Abuja, on Friday. Nabena said the opposition party was simply exhibiting its fear of losing because of the caliber of persons appointed into the APC’s Caretaker Committee as well as the Edo State Governorship Campaign Council. The APC spokesperson said, “We understand the PDP is intimidated by the quality, depth and political sagacity of the APC National Campaign Council deployed by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee to organise a formidable campaign structure to ensure the success of the APC and our candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu during the election.

The Edo electorate is sensible, sophisticated and progressive. The focus of the APC is to display to the Edo electorate our pro-people credentials, infrastructure/development track record, social investments, wealth creation initiatives among others which is being replicated across APC states. “APC is a party that fiercely advocates, practices and defends the principle of “One person, one vote”. Come September 19 every valid vote must count. “We urge the PDP to concentrate on their deadbeat and empty campaign instead of the comic it has turned itself to. Edo is proudly an APC state.”
