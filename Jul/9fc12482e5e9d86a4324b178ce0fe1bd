Kelvin Ekerete The family of late Enugu Rangers player, Ifeanyi George, will be presented with an insurance benefit cheque of between N15 to N20m on July 21, in Enugu, the former Nigerian champions have said. Rangers Team Manager Amobi Ezeaku disclosed the sum to The PUNCH shortly after the club made the announcement in a statement on Twitter on Monday. George and teammate Emmanuel Ogbu were killed in a car accident on March 22, along the Benin-Agbor Expressway in Delta State, while on their way to Lagos after the domestic league was suspended due to COVID-19. “The management is set to present the insurance benefit cheque to the family of Late Ifeanyi George on July 21, 2020, in Enugu. It’s the first of it’s kind in club football in the country,”the club stated. Rangers Team Manager, Amobi Ezeaku, who did not disclose the specific amount to be paid to George’s family, urged other teams to emulate the 2016 NPFL champions by putting the welfare of their players first. “I can tell you that the amount is between N15m and N20m,”  Amobi told The PUNCH. It is the first of its kind in Nigeria. It has never been done anywhere in the league and we are encouraging other clubs to do the same and look into the welfare of players,” Amobi told The PUNCH. “N15 to N20m is a lot of money but we cannot quantify in monetary terms the impact of Ifeanyi’s loss to the club, the family, and to his friends. “This is Rangers being professional and hopefully this money will go a long way in catering for his daughter’s education and family.” Copyright PUNCH.
