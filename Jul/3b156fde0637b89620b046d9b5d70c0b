Peter Dada, Akure Following the death of the Ondo State Commissioner for Health, Wahab Adegbenro, the state government has declared Friday, July 3, a work-free day to honour the departed commissioner. The government also directed that all flags in the state must fly at half-mast for seven days beginning Thursday, July 2. Adegbenro passed away at the age of 65 at the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, but the cause of his death had not been ascertained as of the time of filing this report. The state Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo, in a statement, said, “Until his death, Adegbenro, a two-time health commissioner in the state, equally doubled as Chairman, Ondo State Inter-ministerial Committee Against COVID-19. “Dr Adegbenro was in the forefront of the state’s battles against the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic. Not only did he signpost commitment and diligence; he, indeed, was immeasurable in his inspiration clearly defining himself as an embodiment of selflessness, hardwork and inexorable professionalism. “This is one death too heavy to bear. The excruciating pains the timing has unsparingly, wrought on us in Ondo State are no less potent. To say the least, Dr Adegbenro was our General and died healing others. Having served humanity with the attendant kindness, he played his part honourably.” “The least we can do for this Medical Hero is to plant a seed of honour for him.”
