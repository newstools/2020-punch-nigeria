Ada Wodu, Calabar Three suspected kidnappers have lost their lives after a gun battle with operatives of the Anti-Cultism/Kidnapping Squad of the Cross River State Police Command. The incident happened on Okoro Agbor Street, Calabar, on Tuesday, while the squad was trying to rescue a kidnap victim. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, who disclosed this in a statement, said, “On Tuesday, July 7, 2020, around 7.30pm, a distress call was received that a gang of suspected kidnappers that had been terrorising the metropolis and its environs kidnapped an unsuspecting person on Okoro Agbor Street, Calabar. “Consequent upon a swift response by operatives of the Anti-Cultism/Kidnapping Squad, the said gang opened fire on sighting the police and this resulted in the exchange of gunfire, which culminated in the death of three of the suspected kidnappers due to the serious injuries they sustained.” Ugbo said the suspects died while receiving treatment at the Police Hospital in Calabar. She gave their names as Akpan Godwin, 25; Johnson Aniekan, 27; and Udeme Michael Okon. “The kidnapped victim was rescued unhurt and is now reunited with his family. Items recovered from the hoodlums include a blue Audi saloon car with number plate XA 827 ANA, one locally-made pistol, one live cartridge, one expended cartridge and charms,” she added. The PPRO urged members of the public to promptly give useful information and also report suspicious movements to the police, adding that the community policing initiative introduced by the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, was yielding results.
