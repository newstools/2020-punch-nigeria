Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has approved the re-appointments of 12 non-career ambassadors. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. The announcement came barely 24 hours after the President requested the approval of the Senate for the confirmation of 41 non-career and one career ambassadorial nominees. Shehu quoted Buhari as assuring Nigerians of fairness in representation and inclusiveness in all matters of governance. He said the assurance from the President became necessary following recent complaints after the announcement of 41 non-career ambassadors that some states were not captured.
