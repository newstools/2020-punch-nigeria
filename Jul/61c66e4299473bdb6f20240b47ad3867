Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Osun State Police Command has arrested one Ayo Olawuyi, who allegedly attacked and damaged some facilities at the Muslim Hospital, Ede, after his relation died in the health facility. The spokesperson for the command, Yemisi Opalola, stated this in a chat with PUNCH Metro on Thursday. Ayo, it was gathered, had taken his sick relation to the hospital and while being treated, the said relation died and the doctor on duty broke the news to him. The suspect allegedly attacked the doctor and patients, who were on admission in the hospital, before using an iron rod to break glass windows on the premises. Ayo allegedly returned to the hospital later in the day and forcefully took away the corpse and rejected appeals by the doctor to allow an autopsy to be conducted on the corpse. Opalola said Ayo had been apprehended, adding that because he reportedly slept on the dead body, he could not be kept in the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department until his health status had been ascertained. She stated, “The suspect was arrested with a woman, said to be his sister, on Wednesday. We are aware that he slept on, or had contact with a dead body. Their samples have been taken for COVID-19 test.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
