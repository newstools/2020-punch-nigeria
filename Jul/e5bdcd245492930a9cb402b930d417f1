Godwin ISENYO, Kaduna. Some gunmen on Monday evening invaded Gora Gan village in Zango-Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State and killed no fewer than 10 persons, including the village head. The PUNCH gathered that among those killed was a seven-year-old boy. This is coming less than 24 hours after gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen attacked Kukum Daji village in Kagoro chiefdom of Kaura LGA of the state. At least 21 persons were reportedly killed in that attack while scores sustained varying degrees of injuries. In the fresh attack, scores of residents sustained varying degrees of injuries. It was gathered that the gunmen in large numbers invaded the village around 7 pm on Monday. The Vice-Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria of Zango-Kataf LGA, Pastor Isaac Ango-Makama, who confirmed the incident, said several houses were burnt during the attack. He said corpses of victims were deposited at the Zonkwa General Hospital morgue while the injured were rushed to an undisclosed hospital for treatment. “The villagers are still searching for their missing loved ones,” the cleric said. The Secretary of the Mercy Internally Displaced Persons’ camp, Zonkwa, Ezekiel James, said they were in dire need of support to cater for the displaced persons. James added that IDPs camp was daily receiving victims who had been displaced following persistent attacks on villages. The opposition Peoples Democratic Party in the state while condemning the attack on Tuesday, said the spate of attacks on the Southern Kaduna was unacceptable. The state Publicity Secretary, Abraham Catoh, in the statement, said the state governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai was not doing enough to curb the insecurity in the state. Meanwhile, the Kaduna State Police Command is yet to confirm the fresh attack. The State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, neither returned a call by our correspondent nor did he respond to the text message sent to his phone.
