Adelani Adepegba, Abuja Security operatives on Monday took away Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, for questioning. It was gathered that operatives of the Department of State Services were involved in the operation. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Magu was arrested but fresh facts show that he was taken away for questioning. EFCC spokesman, Dele Oyewale, confirmed this in a statement, saying Magu honoured an invitation by a Presidential panel reviewing the activities of the EFCC at the Banquet Hall wing of the Presidential Villa, Abuja. “He was served the invitation to the panel, while on his way to the Force Headquarters, Abuja for a meeting.
