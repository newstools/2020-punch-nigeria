John Alechenu, Abuja The highly influential nephew of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Mamman Daura, has suggested that the most qualified Nigerian irrespective of zone should succeed his uncle in 2023. Daura made this suggestion in a rare interview he granted the Hausa Service of the BBC, monitored in Abuja, on Tuesday. According to him, since Nigerians have tried the rotational presidency about thrice already, it would be better to go for the most qualified candidate in 2023 irrespective of whether he comes from the north of the south. This, he said, would be better for the nation’s unity. When asked about his relationship with president Buhari, he said, “He is my uncle, he is my father’s younger brother. My father is the first born of their mother and General Buhari is their last.” In response to another question whether it was true that he and the president spent their younger years together, he said, “It is true we are together.” Asked if he visits the president to greet and offer advice now that Buhari is in power, he said, “Yes, I usually go and visit and offer advice. If he asks me, I offer advice but I don’t just go and tell him what to do; you don’t do that with the government.” On issues relating to the 2023 Presidential Elections, Daura, who obviously believes the rotational presidency which began in 1999, has outlived its usefulness, said, “Rotation has been done once, twice and three times-it is important that this nation should be united as one, the most qualified/ competent (among aspirants) should be elected and not someone who comes from a particular zone.”
