Adelani Adepegba, Abuja Gunmen suspected to be policemen, on Thursday, sacked the Federal Capital Territory Mobile Court sitting in Deidei, a suburb of the FCT, for allegedly arresting their colleagues for not wearing face masks. The policemen reportedly fired gunshots and forced the court officials to scamper for safety. Trouble reportedly started when personnel of the FCT Ministerial Joint Enforcement Task Team on COVID-19 Restrictions arrested a policeman, who gave his name as Agada Gabriel, for not wearing a face mask in public and for overloading his vehicle with passengers. He was said to have called on his colleague, one Smart Jacob. The two men were subsequently charged with overloading and non-use of face masks and sentenced accordingly, but they allegedly refused to pay their fines or engage in community service as directed by the court. They were said to have mobilised their colleagues from the Mobile Police Barracks in Dei-Dei, who stormed the court, shooting indiscriminately. The Presiding Magistrate, Theresa Otu; the prosecutor, Emmanuel Yatsegha; and other court officials, including a correctional service officer, fled the court premises. The rampaging policemen allegedly dismantled the canopy used for the court proceedings. The Chairman of the task team, Ikharo Attah, expressed confidence in the ability of the FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, to apprehend and sanction the errant police officers. Copyright PUNCH.
