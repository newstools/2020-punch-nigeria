Tukur Muntari, Kano THE two officials of the Kano State branch of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria who allegedly went into hiding after they were released on bail by the state anti-graft agency, have resurfaced and reported back to the agency. Recall that the two officials of the association were arrested over alleged fraud of N10bn Anchor Borrower loan scheme and released on bail last week with an undertaking to report back to the agency, but they failed to do so. The Chairman of the state Pubic Complaints and Anti-corruption Commission, Muhuyu Rimingado, told The PUNCH in a telephone interview on Thursday that the RIFAN chairman, Abubakar Haruna and Deputy Secretary, Ado Yakasai, had since reported back to the commission.
