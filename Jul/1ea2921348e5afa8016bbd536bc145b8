Adelani Adepegba and Oladimeji Ramon The British Government has refused to grant Diplomatic Landing Clearance to Air Peace Limited for the purpose of evacuating Nigerians, who are stranded in the United Kingdom. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs disclosed this in a statement on Sunday by its spokesman, Ferdinand Nwonye. The ministry regretted that as a result of the development, the airlifting of stranded Nigerians, which was earlier scheduled for today (Monday), had now been shifted to Tuesday. It also noted that instead of the Heathrow Airport as earlier planned, the flight would be taking off from the Gatwick Airport, London. The Federal Government, however, commended the Chairman, Air Peace Limited, Allen Onyema, and the airlines’ management “for their commitment and patriotism in ensuring that our stranded nationals in the United Kingdom return home safely.” The government noted that to make the airlifting of the citizens possible, Air Peace had to, following an appeal by the government, engage the services of another airline, Global Air Charter, instead of refunding the fares made by the stranded Nigerians. “The Federal Government, however, regrets any inconvenience these changes might have caused,” the statement added.
