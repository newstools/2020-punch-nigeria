John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party has urged the Federal Government to immediately charge the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, to court to clear his name over allegations of corruption levelled against him. In a statement titled, “Fraud Allegations: PDP Demands Magu’s Immediate Arraignment In Court
…Rejects Pat on Wrist Approach“ signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, on Thursday, the PDP said, the delay in arraigning Magu was raising concerns about the anti-graft war. The PDP said, “The delay by the Federal Government to arraign the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, over allegations of fraud is raising public apprehensions over the integrity of the fight against corruption in Nigeria.

Ologbondiyan said, “Our party holds that where there are no undesirable underhand dealings, any government that is committed to the fight against corruption, in such a manner that the Buhari Presidency wants the world to believe it does, should have since perfected its processes and arraign the suspended EFCC acting Chairman in court, particularly with the weight of allegations and revelations unearthed at the Presidential panel.“ He further said, “The fact is that the allegations of fraud including alleged stealing of billions of naira recovered by the EFCC among other accusations, which also include alleged transfer of stolen money to certain government officials, are already in the public domain. “The expectation of Nigerians, therefore, is for the Federal Government to immediately arraign Magu before a court of competent jurisdiction and prosecute him in line with the dictates of our laws.
