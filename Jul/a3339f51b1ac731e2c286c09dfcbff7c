Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi on Sunday said he played a pivotal role in the victory of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and the All Progressives Congress in the 2016 governorship election in the state. Ajayi, has been at loggerheads with the governor before and after he left the APC and joined the Peoples Democratic Party. He said this in response to a statement made by his boss, Rotimi Akeredolu, who said Ajayi’s choice as deputy governor was a mistake. But the deputy governor who spoke through his  media aide, Mr Tope Okeowo, on Sunday said, such a statement from the governor could only come from a frustrated politician. Ajaji’s statement read in part, “It must be put on record that Akeredolu contested in the 2012 governorship election and came a distant third in the election won by Dr Olusegun Mimiko of the Labour Party. “It was the experience, weight and political capital Ajayi brought into the 2016 gubernatorial election that produced the current APC-led government in the state. “If there is any wrong choice, it is Governor Akeredolu who has refused to take all-wise counsel not only from his deputy, but by senior citizens of Ondo State.” Copyright PUNCH.
