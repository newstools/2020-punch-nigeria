Sampson Itode, P’Harcourt THERE was a mild drama on Wednesday at a Rivers State High Court in Port Harcourt when a suspected serial killer, Gracious David-West, who is facing trial for the murder of nine women, accused prison wardens of torture. David-West told the court that he was being manhandled by the wardens at the Nigerian Correctional Service facility in Port Harcourt, where he was being held in custody. He said, “Allow me speak to journalists; I must speak with them today. I will tell them how you prison wardens have been assaulting me and beating me in prison. “Even my teeth are hurting me. Let me tell journalists what is happening in the prison; how you people are treating us.” Reacting to the complaints, Justice Adolphus Enebeli, ordered that the wardens should treat the suspected serial killer better at the Correctional Service facility. When the continuation of the trial billed for final adoption of written addresses continued, counsel for defendant informed the court that the prosecuting counsel had yet to serve them their addresses. Justice Enebeli ordered the prosecution to file in their written addresses within seven days. He also ordered both counsels to reply the addresses on point of law within seven days, before adjourning the matter till August 14 for adoption of written addresses. Copyright PUNCH.
