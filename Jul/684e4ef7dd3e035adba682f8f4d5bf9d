Östersunds FK manager, Ian Burchnall, has denied claims that talented 20-year-old Nigerian striker, Attah Kadiri, will be joining Belgian champions, Club Brugge this summer. There have been reports in the Swedish media that Kadiri, who joined the club in 2019 from Nasarawa United, will be making a switch to the Belgian side after an impressive first season at the club. Swedish publication, Östersunds-Posten, had reported that the club were close to selling the striker but the news has been refuted by Östersunds FK manager. Burchnall confirmed that there were several interests for the striker, but added that they were not contacted by the Belgian champions. “I haven’t heard anything about Club Bruges. But there is a tremendous interest in him,” he told fotbolltransfers.com. Kadiri’s stock at the club has increased after scoring five goals and providing two assists in nine appearances for the Swedish outfit.
