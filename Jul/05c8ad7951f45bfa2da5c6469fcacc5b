Samson Folarin Members of the Lagos State House of Assembly have paid tributes to a former Chairman of the House Committee on Information, Strategy and Security, Tunde Braimoh. During a valedictory session in his honour on Monday, the lawmakers  lauded the contributions of the deceased to the Kosofe Constituency II, which he represented, and the Assembly. The Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, described the lawmaker as a man of uncommon intelligence. “Late Braimoh was a man of political sagacity, dutiful, energetic, great man of medals, a profound wordsmith, orator of high repute and a respecter of constituted authority despite his age and experience in public administration in the state,” he said. Another lawmaker, Wasiu Sanni-Eshinlokun, while lamenting the death, prayed that other lawmakers would see the end of the 9th Assembly alive. The Speaker afterwards directed the Clerk of the House, Mr Azeez Sanni, to officially inform the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, and Chairman, All Progressives Congress, of the passing of Braimoh. Braimoh died on Friday, July 10, 2020 in Lagos after a brief illness. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
