Temiloluwa O’Peters The Trade Union Congress of Nigeria on Sunday kicked against the recent move by the Federal Inland Revenue Service to impose various percentages of stamp duty on all tenancy and lease agreements. In a statement signed by the TUC’s President, Quadri Olaleye, and the Secretary-General, Musa-Lawal, the union described the move as “another ploy to further impoverish Nigerians.” It said, “Sometimes, we wonder if there is any milk of kindness left in our leadership. “Should enforcement of stamp duty on house rent and Certificate of Occupancy be on the priority list of the FIRS at a time the country is experiencing a housing deficit and millions of Nigerians have lost their jobs? “We read that Ghanaians will not be paying for power throughout this year. Why is our case always different? Why increase our burden now?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
