Peter David, Benin City The presiding judge of a Federal High Court in Benin City, Edo State, Justice Umar Garba, on Tuesday adjourned to July 14 the N700m fraud case levelled against the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Osagie Ize-Iyamu. The APC governorship candidate was absent in the court due to alleged ill health. Ize-Iyamu and four others, who are standing trial over an alleged N700m fraud case preferred against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, were supposed to appear before the court on Tuesday. Counsel for the 1st defendant, Charles Edosomwan (SAN), told the judge that his client, Ize-Iyamu, could not make it to the court as he was indisposed. He prayed the judge to allow him to present the certificate of his ill health as certified by his medical doctor to the court. The judge, having listened to the counsel for the 1st defendant, adjourned the case till July 14, 2020, for hearing. In Suit No. FHC/BE21C/ 2016, the anti-graft agency had filed eight count charges against the accused persons bordering on alleged illegal receipt of public funds to the tune of N700m for the 2015 general elections. The court had in its last sitting on June 18 validated the corruption charges against the defendants and adjourned the case till July 7 for further hearing. The other defendants are a former state chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dan Orbih; the incumbent chairman, Tony Aziegbemi; a former deputy governor of Edo State, Lucky Imasuen, and Efe Erimuoghae-Anthony.
