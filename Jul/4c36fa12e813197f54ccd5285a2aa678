John Alechenu, Abuja An Ondo State All Progressives Congress governorship aspirant, Dr. Nat Adejutelegan has said eleven out of the 12 aspirants jostling for the APC governorship ticket in the state were asking the party to use the direct mode for conducting the party primary. The aspirant said this while speaking to journalists in Abuja, on Sunday. According to him, the indirect mode which restricts the choice of candidate to delegates, confers undue advantage on the incumbent Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu because his aides and appointees would be recognized as delegates. Adejutelegan said, “In the APC (primary) in 2018, the congress in Ondo State was fraught with irregularities and improprieties. “I respectfully ask the national leadership of our party to adopt direct primary because direct primary would avoid deepening internal crisis in the party, direct primary will unify all members of the party in readiness and preparation for the governorship election it will prevent disenfranchising a majority of the members of the party.
