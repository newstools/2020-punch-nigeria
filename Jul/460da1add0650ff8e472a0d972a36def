Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja Alleged international fraudster, Ramoni Abass alias Huhspuppi, once sold second-hand clothes on the streets of Lagos State, British newspaper, Daily Mail, has reported. The report read in part, “Mr Abbas started out as a secondhand-clothes trader in Lagos before claiming to be a billionaire property developer in Dubai.” There were also reports by some of his old friends that his father was a taxi driver in Nigeria. The PUNCH could, however, not independently verify this. Hushpuppi was arrested in Dubai last month for allegedly diverting over half a billion dollars from private accounts through a series of fraudulent activities. He alongside others were subsequently extradited from the United Arab Emirates to the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation to face charges.
