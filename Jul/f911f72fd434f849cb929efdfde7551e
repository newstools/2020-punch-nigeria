Ade Adesomoju, Abuja Plaintiffs in the suit which led to the suspension of the immediate past National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, on Thursday, withdrew their suit which gave rise to the March 4, 2020 interim order  of the court. The Court of Appeal in Abuja had on June 16, 2020 affirmed the interim order issued by the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in Jabi, Abuja. While the main suit was still pending before the FCT High Court, the National Executive Committee dissolved the National Working Committee of the party led by Oshiomhole on June 25. Parties to the suit were to return to the FCT High Court on Thursday for the continuation of the main case when the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Oluwole Afolabi, told the judge, Justice Danlami Senchi, that his clients had decided to withdraw the suit. Afolabi said the decision was in line with the directive of the APC leadership that all pending suits relating to the party’s leadership crisis be withdrawn. Oshiomhole’s lawyer, Ginika Ezeoke, said she had no objection to the application to withdraw the suit. Justice Senchi then made an order dismissing the suit. The suit was instituted earlier this year by six applicants, including the then Vice-Chairman of the party, North-East, Mustapha Salihu, and the Chairman of the party in Edo State, Anslem Ojezua. Recall that Oshiomhole’s Ward 10 in Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State had in November 2019 suspended him as a member of the party for anti-party activities, a decision which Justice Senchi relied on to order his suspension as the National Chairman of the party on March 4, 2020.
