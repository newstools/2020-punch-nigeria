Ahmadu Adamu, and his team are working tirelessly and continuously liaising with appropriate agencies to ensure the prompt payment of the remaining three months of arrears, in furtherance to the Federal Government’s resolve to improve the welfare of military pensioners in the country.” The MPB urged all military retirees to continue to support the board, “as it continues to ensure that all the retired personnel of the Armed Forces of Nigeria get their deserved entitlements.” Lawal encouraged the retirees to always stick to the established official means of communication provided by the board for authentic information. According to him, these include direct calls to the board’s official call centre and the public relations officer.
