John Charles Makurdi The Police in Benue State have recovered the bodies of 14 of the 26 youths who drowned in River Benue on Sunday. The youths, who were members of the Evangelical Church Winning All, were travelling by boat to a conference known as ‘New Life for All’ at Sabo Rai, on an island called Kwaghter, in the Makurdi Local Government Area, when their boat capsized. According to a statement issued by the command spokesperson, DSP Catherine Anene, eight females and five males were recovered from the river, while other victims are still missing. Anene, who said the command commiserated with the families of the deceased, prayed God to grant them the fortitude to bear the losses. The command urged members of the public to always exercise caution while sailing, as turbulent flow of water during the rainy season could be dangerous. “The CP, while sympathising with the bereaved families, commended the efforts made by sailors and communities around the river bank during the rescue operation and urged them to educate their children and wards on the dangers of using waterways during this period,” the statement said.
