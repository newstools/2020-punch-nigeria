’Femi Asu with agency report Italian prosecutors have asked for Shell and Eni to be fined and some of their present and former executives, including Eni Chief Executive Officer, Claudio Descalzi, to be jailed in a long-running trial over alleged corruption in Nigeria. Eni and Shell jointly acquired the rights to a Nigerian offshore oil block, Oil Prospecting Licence 245, for about $1.3bn but the deal had spawned legal cases spanning several countries. A related trial in Italy continues. The OPL 245 is one of the biggest sources of untapped oil reserves on the African continent with reserves estimated at nine billion barrels. In a Milan court, prosecutors asked on Tuesday for eight years in prison for Descalzi and seven years and four months for Shell’s former Head of Upstream, Malcolm Brinded, according to Reuters. The prosecutors also asked for Eni and Shell to be fined 900,000 euros ($1.04m) each and sought to confiscate a total of $1.09bn from all the defendants in the case, the equivalent of the bribes alleged to have been paid. The companies and individuals accused have all denied wrongdoing in the case. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
