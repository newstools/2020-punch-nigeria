Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Osun State Government had said a new investor had been found for MKO Abiola International Airport, Ido Osun. The State’s Commissioner for Works and Transportation, Remi Owowaiye, disclosed this on Friday during the Ministerial Press Conference organised by the Ministry of Information and Civic Orientation. Recall that ex-governor Rauf Aregbesola in May, 2018, during an interactive session, had said the concession agreement entered with AWOL International Limited, a private consultancy firm, on the project had failed. However, Omowaiye said many investors had indicated interest in the project, adding that government was at the stage of entering into Memorandum of Understanding with one of the investors before the advent of coronavirus. He said, “Many investors have shown interest in the development of the project. Government is at the stage of entering into MOU with one of the investors on a BOT arrangement and serious meeting had been held with the leading investor and their partners from USA. “If not for COVID-19 pandemic, the MOU would have been signed and site handed over by now.” Copyright PUNCH.
