Samson Folarin The Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has congratulated a former minister of State for Defence, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, on his 60th birthday. Sanwo-Olu, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Gboyega Akosile, on Tuesday, described the former Nigerian High Commissioner to Ghana as a seasoned politician and an administrator, who used his positions for the development of Lagos and Nigeria at large. He noted that Obanikoro contributed “immensely to the growth and development of Lagos State as a council chairman, commissioner, distinguished senator and minister.” “Senator Musiliu Obanikoro started his political journey with the progressives, later pitched tent with the opposition, but as a true supporter of progressive ideals, returned to the All Progressives Congress, where he’s currently contributing his quota for the progress of the party,” he added.
