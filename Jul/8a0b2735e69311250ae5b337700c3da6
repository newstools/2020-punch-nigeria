Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has said it is not feasible for states to take the ownership of the Federal government roads  unless the privatisation Act is amended. Gbajabiamila said this while speaking with journalists shortly after he met with the Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, in his Oke-Mosan office in Abeokuta. He said he held deliberations with the governor on how the federal and state governments could collaborate towards the advancement of the state. He explained Abiodun raised the issue of how the Federal Government roads could be ceded to the states. He said, “It is for us to look whether it is even legal for the Federal Government to transfer federal roads to any states. It might even require the amendment of the Privatisation Act. “But if that is not feasible, there are other models that we can look at it in terms of other people fixing the roads and then the Federal Government owing them or setting off whatever debts owed by the state.” Earlier, Abiodun had solicited the support of the National Assembly for the takeover and reconstruction of the Lagos-Sango-Abeokuta and the Sagamu-Ikorodu roads by Ogun and Lagos state governments.
