Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun state Police command on Sunday  raised  the alarm that it had   uncovered plans by members of a notorious cult to launch a statewide campaign of terror and violence on Tuesday. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said this in a statement  on Sunday. Oyeyemi said members of the cult intended to use Tuesday to mark their strange Calendar Day- christened 7/7, where new members would be initiated into the fold. He added that the cult also planned to round off the ceremony with violent confrontation with its rival in a manner that could lead to loss of lives and wanton destruction of property. Oyeyemi said, “In view of this, the command wishes to warn those having such devilish plan to have a rethink and retrace their steps as such move will be met with serious resistance from security agencies.” Copyright PUNCH.
