John Alechenu, Abuja The Secretary of the National Caretaker Committee of All Progressives Congress, Senator John Udoedeghe, has urged party members to work hard ahead of the 2023 general elections. He said the era of people hiding under the integrity of the President, Major General Muhammed (retd.), would be over by then. The National Secretary gave the advice while receiving members of the Coalition of APC Support Groups, led by Frank Ossai, at the APC National Secretariat, Abuja, on Wednesday. Udoedeghe said, “All of you in national politics; make sure that you are relevant in your ward, you are relevant in your local government, you are relevant in your state. In 2023 the personality of Buhari will not be on the ticket.” He also assured aggrieved party members that the caretaker committee was prepared to ensure that justice and fairness in the handling of their grievances just as he said they will be carried along in the party’s rebuilding efforts. In response to a complaint of non-inclusion in the party’s activities as well the party’s contentious reward system, he said, “Owing to your contribution to the party, we will integrate and reconcile aggrieved members to ensure that they are part of the party system.” Earlier the leader of the coalition, Frank Ossai, appealed to the Caretaker Committee to look into a report earlier submitted by the Sen. Ken Nnamani-led panel. Ossai said, “I believe that the report is still with the party. The new APC Caretaker Committee should look into it and see how they can reconcile our members who are aggrieved to come and work for the party.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
