Tony Okafor, Awka The Ohanaeze Ndigbo General Assembly has dragged the Registrar General of the Corporate Affairs Commission and others to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. In a petition to the EFCC made available to our correspondent in Awka, the Anambra State capital on Monday, the Igbo group said its deregistration last week by the CAC was suspicious. The petition by its lawyer, J .O. Ekwenze, alleged that millions of dollar bribe was  given to influence the CAC’s action. The group enjoined the EFCC to investigate the matter. Their petition read in part,”We hereby called on the chairman of the EFCC to investigate the ongoing sharp practices at the CAC, threats to life of Barrister Basil Onyeachonam Onuorah, the president general of Ohanaeze Ndigbo General Assembly and invite one of the principal suspects, Chief John Nnia Nwodo for security questioning. “We have also served pre-action/demand notice to CAC for immediate withdrawal of the purported public notice and reinstatement of Ohanaeze Ndigbo General Assembly at the commission’s portal/database, and failure to so within the expected timeframe will result to court action.” Copyright PUNCH.
