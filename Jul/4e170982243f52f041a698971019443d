Dayo Ojerinde with agency report The United State of America has commenced an experimental COVID-19 vaccine with 30,000 volunteers. According to washingtonpost.com, some Americans received shots of the vaccine on Monday created by the US government as part of the all-out global race to stop the outbreak. The vaccine is being developed by the biotechnology company, Moderna, in collaboration with the US National Institutes of Health. The US Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, said, “The vaccination marks a much-anticipated milestone; the official launch of the first in a series of large US clinical trials that will each test experimental vaccines in 30,000 participants, half receiving the shot and half receiving a placebo.” Fauci predicted that researchers could understand whether the vaccine worked by November or December, although he explained that it was a “distinct possibility” an answer could come sooner. “The vaccine requires two doses, nearly a month apart, and then researchers will have to wait to see whether people get sick from coronavirus. What they hope to witness is a clear benefit.,” he said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
