Peter David, Benin City Immediate past National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has vowed to ensure that the APC wrestles Edo State from the grip of the Peoples Democratic Party in the governorship election scheduled for September 19th. Oshiomhole made the vow on Saturday night while addressing supporters at his Iyamho country home, in the Etsako West Local Government Area of the state. Oshiomhole said, “We want to return to the government of the people by the people and for the people. We have a common mission to bring Edo back to the parts of sustainable development. I am back and ready for Edo, my home state. “I have come home to join you and start the process of reclaiming the house back to the family of the APC. “If the people say yes, and God says yes, there is no man born of a woman that can say no. “So, now, I have only one mission and I know it is our common mission; to bring Edo back to the parts of sustainable development.” Copyright PUNCH.
