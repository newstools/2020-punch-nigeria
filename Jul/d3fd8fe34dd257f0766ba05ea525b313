Sampson Itode, P/ Harcourt THE Rivers State Police Command on Thursday arrested five women in Port Harcourt, the state capital, for their alleged involvement in illegal trading of infants. It was learnt that the suspects were caught at Rumuokwuta Junction while negotiating the purchase of a two-week old baby. Upon investigation, the confessional statements of the suspects revealed that one of the suspects identified as Roseline Nwokocha, who was arrested with N1.1m , which she came with to buy the baby, was the kingpin. Nwokocha was nabbed by the police with his sister, Chioma, who accompanied her to carry out the illegal transaction. She said, “I came from Umuahia. I was arrested at Rumuokwuta junction. My sister, Chi-Chi, called me that there was a two-week-old baby for sale and asked me to come if I had somebody that would buy the baby. “I decided to come and check the baby very well. She told me the baby was N1m, but I decided to come and see the baby first. I came with my sister. This is not the first time I came to buy a baby. “The time, I came to buy the other one; my sister also came with me. I bought the first one at N1.1m. But this one, I also collected N1.1m from the person that wanted the child.” The suspect further confessed that she gave the first baby she bought to a couple in Aba, Abia State, even as she refused to disclose their identities. When contacted, the Rivers state Police Public Relations Officer, Nnamdi Omoni, said the Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mukan, had ordered an investigation into matter. Copyright PUNCH.
