Godwin Isenyo Special Adviser to Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State on Media, Isa Gusau, said his principal embarked on a trip to the Baga area of the state based on information provided by soldiers that they have liberated the town from the hold of Boko Haram insurgents. The PUNCH had earlier reported that members of the sect on Wednesday attacked the convoy of the governor while he was on his way to some internally displaced persons camps in the area. Gusau, while speaking in an interview on BBC Hausa Service on Thursday monitored by our correspondent, said the governor and his team were in good condition. Although the spokesman said he was not in the governor’s convoy but stressed that the soldiers, before the trip, had assured the governor, who was on a humanitarian mission to Baga, that the town was no longer taken by the insurgents. He said, “I was not there physically. The governor was heading to Baga from Munguno because the soldiers told him they have liberated Baga from the control of Boko Haram.” READ ALSO: Ndume faults FG’s amnesty for repentant Boko Haram fighters But along the way, the insurgents opened fire on the governor’s convoy and everyone scampered for their lives. Gusau explained that some of those in the convoy including policeman, government officials, amongst others, sustained injuries in the process. “They crawled for a distance on their knees. They sustained injuries. The Boko Haram insurgents were shooting,” he added.
