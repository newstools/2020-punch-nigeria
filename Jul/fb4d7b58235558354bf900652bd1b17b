Kayode Oyero The Head of the Department of State Services at the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Safiyanu Abba, has allegedly breached security protocol at the airport. Abba also assaulted an aviation security personnel on duty who called him to order, said the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria in a statement on Wednesday. FAAN said the DSS boss had prevented security officers at the airport from performing a mandatory check on a passenger on Friday. The statement read, “We note with dismay that Mr Safiyanu Abba, the Head of DSS at NAIA deliberately obstructed airport security process, and slapped an Aviation Security Officer who was performing his duty by calling on Mr Safiyanu Abba to desist from doing so. “This happened on the 17th July at about 15:25 hours. He breached security procedure by obstructing further search of a visitor who had just walked through the metal detector and activated the alarm. “The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria strongly condemns this abuse of power and the security process in our airport. This has also been duly escalated. FAAN is committed to the core values of safety, security, and comfort.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that the airport authority last week accused former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, and Adamawa State governor, Umaru Fintiri, of breaching Covid-19 protocol at its airports.
