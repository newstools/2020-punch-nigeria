Umar Muhammed, Lafia Worried by the rising cases of flood, the Nasarawa State Government said it had demolished no fewer than 40 illegal structures built along waterways in three local government areas of the state. Similarly, 27 persons have been arrested and prosecuted by the mobile court for violating the monthly environmental sanitation law in the state. Six shops and residential houses were submerged by flood following a downpour in the state. The Chief Environmental Officer in the state Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Mr Abubakar Mohammed, revealed these in an interview with The PUNCH after monitoring the monthly environmental sanitation in Lafia, the state capital. He said the drastic steps taken by the state government were aimed at averting flood, adding that the lukewarm attitude of some residents towards government’s directive against building structures on waterways necessitated the demolition. “Twenty-seven persons were arrested and prosecuted by the mobile court for violating the monthly environmental sanitation law in the state,” Mohammed added.
