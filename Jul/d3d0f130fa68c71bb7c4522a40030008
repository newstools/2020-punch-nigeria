Temiloluwa O’Peters The Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers has called on the Lagos State Government to certify industry experts to enable them to inspect buildings. The Chairman, NIESV, Lagos State branch, Adedotun Bamigbola, made the call during a visit to the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development on Friday. While congratulating the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako, on the signing into law of Urban and Regional Planning (Amendment) Law 2019 of Lagos State, Bamigbola described estate surveyors and valuers as critical stakeholders in the implementation of the new regulation. He said the section of the law on compulsory building insurance for buildings above two floors was a welcome development that required the input of estate surveyors and valuers. “As property managers and also those who are certified under law, according to the ESVARBON ACT, Decree 24 of 1975, now CAP. E13 LFN 2004, to do evaluations for various kinds of properties, we, as critical stakeholders, want to support and be a part of the implementation process,” he said. The chairman proposed that certified building inspectors should be provided to work with the Lagos State Building Control Agency to improve the government’s capacity in project monitoring statewide.
