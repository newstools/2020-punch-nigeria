Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The  House of Representatives has called on the Federal Government to fix the Lagos-Abeokuta road, urging the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency to carry out urgent repairs on the affected portions pending the reconstruction of the road. The House also urged the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to include reconstruction of the road in the 2021 budget. A member, James Owolabi, had at the plenary on Tuesday moved a motion titled, ‘Call for Rehabilitation of Abeokuta Expressway from Abule Egba to Sango Tollgate,’ which was unanimously adopted. Moving the motion, Owolabi said the deplorable condition of the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway made it difficult for commuters to ply without recording accidents and loss of lives and properties, adding that a journey of 30 minutes now takes two to three hours. He said, “The House is concerned that the road has suffered so much neglect and abandonment, particularly from Casso Bus Stop, and anytime it rains, the road is flooded because there is no proper drainage system. Armed robbers, kidnappers, bandits and other criminals alike have continued to carry out their dastardly acts on commuters at the dilapidated portions on the road, thereby causing mayhem on the people plying the road.”  Meanwhile, the House also on Tuesday lamented the fire incident in Akesan Market, Oyo Town in Oyo State. Members from the state had moved a motion titled ‘Devastating Fire Disaster at Akesan Market, Main Commercial Area, Oyo Town, Oyo State.’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
