Chima Azubuike, Gombe The Small-scale Women Farmers Organisation in Nigeria, Gombe chapter, has warned of a possible shortage of food in the state on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic. The State Chairperson, SWOFON, Mrs Airudia Mamman, said the looming food crisis could be averted through clear-cut policies in agriculture. Mamman spoke on Monday during a press conference, in collaboration with Gombe State Public Financing of Agriculture with support from Hope Foundation for the Lonely. She said with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the smallholder women farmers producing over 60 per cent of the food consumed in the state had faced hard times caused by partial lockdown. Mamman added that the restriction caused massive post-harvest loss of food items such as rice, maize, millet, tomatoes, onions, and pepper. She said “the current situation of looming food crisis in the state and in Nigeria” was occasioned by the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic, which she said had nearly crippled all sectors of the economy. She said, “The percentage allocation to agriculture is about 2.5 per cent when compared with the total state budget, which is far from 10 per cent Malabo declaration of 2014. “There should be adequate provision for credits and loans for especially smallholder women farmers and youth; this will greatly enhance their output, food sufficiency, security and employment.” On his part, the Chairman of Gombe State Public Financing of Agriculture, Bashama Yusuf, called on the government to ensure the provision of adequate farm inputs for smallholder farmers. The Executive Director, Hope Foundation for the Lonely, Mansa Adamu, said special palliatives should be given to smallholder farmers, especially women. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
