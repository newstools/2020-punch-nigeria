Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Osun State Government has said a private school proprietor in the state had been handed to over to the police for circulating unapproved plan for school reopening. The school reopening proposal was shared in many whatsapp groups in the state on Wednesday and when attention of Special Adviser to the governor on Education, Mr Jamiu Olawumi was drawn to the proposal, he told our correspondent to disregard it. Olawumi, who claimed that the man circulating the said proposal had been arrested by the police on the order of state government, told residents to wait for the directive of Governor Gboyega Oyetola on the issue. According to the said reopening proposal, schools in Osun state were to resume on July 20, 2020 and only 20 children were to sit in a class It was also proposed that big schools would run two shifts of morning, 8am to 12pm; and afternoon, 1.30 pm to 5.30pm daily. But Olawumi said, “Schools were closed by the President and the power to reopen has been conceded to the state governors. Osun citizens should await the announcement as endorsed by the governor very soon. We have handed him (the person behind the proposal) over to the police. Disregard the proposal please.” Efforts to get reaction of Osun State leadership of National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools to the development proved futile. When contacted for clarification, president of NAPPS in the state, Alhaja Muinat Adepoju, told our correspondent she was in a meeting and promised to call back. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
