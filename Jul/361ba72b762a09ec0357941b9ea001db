Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has decried the perennial crisis in Nigeria’s power sector. They, at the beginning of a two-day investigative hearing on the Nigerian Power Sector in Abuja on Wednesday, also declared that various efforts by successive governments to resolve the issues had failed. The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, while declaring the event open, decried that the Federal Government had made huge investments in the power sector with little to show for it. Gbajabiamila, who was represented by the Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Wase, said, it was no longer news that despite huge investments in the power sector, little progress may have been made. “It is becoming increasingly worrisome that successive governments have been unable to fix the issue of power in our country, with the current state of electricity supply apparently dampening the hopes of landmark industrialisation and national development,” he said. He added, “This investigative hearing is the premise upon which the House shall amass adequate information to guide us in causing the required and appropriate legislative intervention in the power sector.” Majority Leader of the House and Chairman of the investigative committee, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, recalled that the Federal Government invited the German Government to help out given the failure of the sector.
