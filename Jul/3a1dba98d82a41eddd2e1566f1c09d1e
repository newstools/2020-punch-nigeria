Samson Folarin The Lagos State Government has asked the Muslim faithful in the state to celebrate the Eid-el-Kabir on a low key due to the existing government protocols on COVID-19. The Commissioner for Home Affairs, Anofiu Elegushi, in a statement on Tuesday, urged residents to be moderate during the festivities scheduled for Friday, July 31, 2020, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic was still at an aggressive stage. “Elegushi asked that the celebration should be within families as observed during the Eid-el-Fitri celebrations three months ago, while the Eid-el-Kabir prayers should be observed at home, as mosques and churches are still on lockdown in the state. “He noted that the religious rites of slaughtering of animal would be carried out through a live broadcast on Friday at 9am by the Grand Chief Imam of Lagos State, Sheikh Suleiman Abou-Nolla, while all other imams in the state would follow suit thereafter,” the statement added. The commissioner reassured all residents that the siege would soon be over as government was leaving no stone unturned in containing the spread of the pandemic. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
