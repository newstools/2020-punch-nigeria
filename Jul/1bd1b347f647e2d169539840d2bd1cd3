Johnny Edward Lille striker Victor Osimhen’s agent, Osita Okolo, says the former Wolfsburg man has had contact with Napoli manager Gennaro Gattuso and club president Aurelio De Laurentiis. Okolo also admitted that the Nigerian likes the Naples environment. The Nigerian forward is reported to be close to agreeing on a deal with the Partenopei after visiting Naples few days ago. The 21-year-old was outstanding in his debut season in France where he scored 18 goals in 38 appearances. He also won Lille’s Player of The Season and the Marc-Vivien Foe award. “Napoli’s interest is important. De Laurentiis and the manager (Gattuso) really like Victor. There have already been several contacts,” Okolo told Tutto Mercato. “Victor likes Naples, a fantastic city, and obviously he also likes Napoli as a team. The interest of a big Italian (club) personally does not surprise me considering how well he did with Lille.” But Napoli manager Gattuso has distanced himself from speculations that Osimhen is close to joining the club, saying he remains a Lille player. “He (Osimhen) is currently a Lille player. I cannot comment,” Gattuso told the press conference on Friday. Gattuso insisted that the Partenopei will spend a little in the transfer market, but it must be a player with quantity. “We will do little on the market, 70-80 per cent (of players) will remain and whoever arrives will have to give us quality and quantity. “For this, we must raise the bar because many will remain and we must improve.” Copyright PUNCH.
