Peter Dada, Akure The winner of the All Progressives Congress primary and governor of Ondo State, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu has called on the other aspirants who lost to support him in winning the October 10 governorship election. Akeredolu clinched the ticket of the APC after defeating the seven other contestants. In the result declared by the Chairman of the primary and Kogi State Governor, Mr Yahaya Bello, Akeredolu polled 2,725 votes while Chief Olusola Oke came second in the contest, having scored 262 votes while Mr Isaac Kekemeke is in third position after polling 19 votes. The governor, who stated this after the primary on Tuesday, in Akure, the state capital, said the pre-primary campaign was greeted with many issues but there was a need for all to join forces with him for the party to move on. He begged all that he must have offended in the course of the preparation for the primary or in his administration, to forgive him. He said, “The campaigns preceding this day have been noticeably fraught with mixed feelings. Relationships in some cases may have been bruised and interests hurt. “In other cases, methods deployed to run these campaigns may not have been pleasant. I plead with all of us to leave these in the past and move on.  This is more so that, all aspirants, including myself, were either victims or indirectly responsible for such unpleasant circumstances. We must find spaces in our hearts to forgive one another. “I am convinced that our individual pursuits were driven by the altruistic motivation to strengthen our great party and more importantly, take our dear State to loftier heights.” The governor expressed optimism that the party would win the governorship election, saying the party’s unity was very paramount.
