Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Governor of Bayelsa State, Mr Douye Diri, has called on the Nigerian Army to make its Forward Operating Base at Agge in the Ekeremor Local Government Area operational to beef up security in the area and in the state. Diri also appealed that the Nigerian Army base in the Oluasiri axis, Nembe Local Government Area, should be made fully operational to check the movement of light arms and other criminal activities. He made the appeal on Tuesday when the General Officer Commanding, 6th Division, Maj. Gen. Felix Agugo, and other senior officers paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House in Yenagoa.
