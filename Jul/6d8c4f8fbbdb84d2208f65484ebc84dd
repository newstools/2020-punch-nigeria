Ada Wodu, Calabar The Nigerian Medical Association, Cross River State branch has confirmed that one of its members died of coronavirus-related complications. She is identified as Reverend sister (Dr) Kate Okpa, serving in Ogoja. Speaking with our correspondent, the state Chairman of the association, Dr Agam Ayuk, said, “It is true (that) we lost one of our colleagues, and nine others are currently down with the virus.” He said efforts were being made to ensure that doctors and other health workers were well protected. Ayuk added, “We are doing what we have been doing before to encourage the government to equip the hospitals for the response.” On the 100-bed Adiabo Isolation Centre which is allegedly shut, he said, “We have written to the Federal Government. We are still waiting for feedback. We have a National Rapid Response team currently in the state. We have not gotten a report yet from them. They are still doing their work. Let us hope that they will get a favourable outcome. “It is true that patients are stranded at the 5-bed University of Calabar Teaching Hospital isolation centre. That is why we are asking for the Adiabo isolation centre to be opened for patient care. Like I said we are waiting for the National Rapid Response team. They are working. “We will be reviewing all these things during our meeting next week and come out with a concrete statement on all the issues. But we have written to the Federal Ministry of Health outlining all the complaints.”
