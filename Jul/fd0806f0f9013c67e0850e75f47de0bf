Oladimeji Ramon Coordinators of the 120 wards in the Akoko area of Ondo State have declared their support for a former Deputy Clerk of the National Assembly, Chief Olayide Adelami, who is aspiring to be Ondo State Governor on the platform of the All Progressives Congress. The ward coordinators in a statement on Thursday, said the decision was taken at a meeting they held with Adelami. According to them, the office of governor is not for those who want to gain experience but for someone like Adelami, “who has already acquired a wealth of experience at the federal level.” Speaking on behalf of the ward coordinators, Ibitoye Kehinde described the aspirant as the hope of the people for a better life. He said, “Adelami’s name has turned out to be a household name within the short time he has spent as a politician in the state right from the 2019 general elections, when he canvassed the whole South-West region for the return of the Buhari/Osinbajo candidacy. “His unabashed antecedent as a public servant has made the generality of Akoko people to reckon with him.
