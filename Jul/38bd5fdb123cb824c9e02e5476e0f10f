Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta Two yet-to-be-identified persons have lost their lives while one other was injured in a fatal auto crash that happened early Tuesday in Ogun State. The accident occurred close to Christopher University around the Mowe axis of the Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of the state at 07:44 am. The Public Relations Officer of the Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps, Babatunde Akinbiyi, confirmed this incident in a statement. Akinbiyi said the vehicles involved in the crash include a Mitsubishi Lancer with registration number AJW 465 AA loaded with pepper and a truck. He said, ” We learnt that the Mitsubishi Lancer loaded with pepper rammed into a moving truck inbound Lagos from behind with two of the three passengers on board, including the driver losing their lives on the spot. “The cause of the accident cannot be immediately ascertained for now, because, the only person that could have given a lead to that is the injured victim whose case is critical. “For now, he can neither talk nor make any gesture that can give a lead. “But we suspect it could be as a result of brake failure and loss of control due to over speeding.” Akinbiyi said that the bodies have been taken to a private morgue in Sagamu while the injured victim has been rushed to another private hospital.
