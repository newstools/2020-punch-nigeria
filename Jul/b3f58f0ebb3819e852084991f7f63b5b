Ebenezer Bajela French club Lille and Napoli are having different opinion concerning the move of Nigeria international Victor Osimhen. The 21-year-old is one of the most sought after strikers in Europe and has been linked with various clubs, with a move to Napoli looking more of a done deal. But while Lille manager Marc Ingla at a press conference on Thursday all but confirmed that Osimhen would leave the club, Napoli’s sporting director, Cristiano Giuntoli, stressed that the club would start negotiations all over again after the player changed agent. “We’re at the final details for the transfer of Osimhen,” explained Ingla. “There were other clubs in for him too, but the player has now made his decision. “It’s a shame to have to sell him, but he’s leaving us.” However, Giuntoli said that the Azzurri were having difficulty completing the transfer of the centre-forward. “Osimhen’s a very good player, but there are lots of other teams who want him and we’re working on other fronts too,” he said to DAZN. “He changed his agent, so we now have to start all over again. It’s a complex and difficult set of negotiations.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
