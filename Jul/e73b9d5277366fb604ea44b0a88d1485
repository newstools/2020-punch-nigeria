Kayode Oyero Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has denied claims that he destroyed the campaign billboards of the All Progressives Congress governorship candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu. Obaseki, who is seeking reelection on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, will face Ize-Iyamu and candidates from other parties in the September 19 governorship election. In a statement on Saturday by the governor’s Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, Obaseki noted that “the allegations are belated antics of a routinely recycled politician”. Osagie stated that the allegations were “ludicrous and unfounded” adding, “Anyone who knows Ize-Iyamu very well knows that this is his approach to politics. He raises the alarm and cries wolf when no one is chasing him. “The state government has not removed any of his billboards. This is cheap blackmail to score lame political points.”
