Kelvin Ekerete Nigerian wrestler, Odunayo Adekuoroye, and other top wrestlers  have been enjoined to attend a World Anti-Doping Agency educational programme, with the governing body stating that taking such course might become a criteria to attending major events. United World Wrestling tasked wrestlers who have qualified for the postponed Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games to complete the course. Adekuoroye is the only Nigerian wrestler that booked her spot in the quadrennial event before the outbreak of the coronavirus. She qualified for the Olympics after winning a bronze medal at the 2019 World Championships in Kazakhstan. The programme, according to UWW, “gives athletes information about the dangers of doping and the importance of anti-doping controls, and promotes positive attitudes to avoiding doping.” UWW says it has also selected 500 wrestlers, including top-ranked junior and senior athletes from countries with a “higher risk” of doping to finish the Alpha online course. UWW said it would start to make obtaining a certificate from the WADA course or “a recognised equivalent delivered by a National Anti-doping Organisation” a pre-requisite to competing at major events including the Olympic Games and World Championships.
