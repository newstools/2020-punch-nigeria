Kelvin Ekerete Secretary-General of the Nigeria Boxing Federation, Sunny Obot, says he is hopeful the Ministry of Youth Sports will refurbish the Brai Ayonote Gymnasium at the National Stadium, Lagos. The gym serves as a preparatory ground for Nigeria’s boxing team to competitions, but has been in a deplorable state for several years. The facility now boasts just a ring in a deplorable state, and a couple of punching bags Sports minister Sunday Dare had promised to refurbish stadiums across the country with the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja recently wearing a new look. Obot believes the recent visit of the ministerial task force to the gym is an indication that it will get a facelift soon. “Last month, the minister sent some group of people to inspect the place. The inspection has been done and we are expecting that it will be renovated,” Obot told The PUNCH. “I want to believe that if we go for the Olympics qualifiers in France and qualify, something will be done, but for now, we’ll have to wait. “We are hopeful because when we qualify, the ministry will take care of everything, including a good training atmosphere for the athletes, which I’m sure is what the minister is preparing for.” Copyright PUNCH.
