Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The  Federal High Court sitting in Owerri on Wednesday ordered the Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma, to reinstate sacked chairmen and councillors of the 27 local government areas of the state who were sacked by the Emeka Ihedioha-led administration. The LGA bosses and their community councillors were elected in 2018 during the Rochas Okorocha administration. Justice Tijani Rigime, who delivered the judgment, ordered the sacked chairmen and councillors to resume work immediately. He described the interim LGA management committee chairmen appointed by the state governor as “ghost workers.” Justice Rigime said the governor had no right under the law to sack elected LGA chairmen whose tenure was constitutionally guaranteed. The judge ordered that the LGA allocations be stopped until the governor obeyed the court judgment reinstating the sacked chairmen. One of the reinstated chairmen, Chizobom O. Chizobam, told our correspondent on the phone that the judgment “is a landmark judgment.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
