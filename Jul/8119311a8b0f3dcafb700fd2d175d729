Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, on Wednesday suspended the Ebonyi FADAMA III Coordinator, Dr Cletus Nwakpu, over alleged corrupt practices and financial crimes. This came barely 24 hours after two auditor-generals were suspended in the state by the governor. Nwakpu’s suspension was announced during a virtual State Executive Council meeting in Abakaliki, which was presided over by the governor. According to Umahi, Nwakpu’s suspension came following a report presented by the state Fiscal Responsibility Commission, which indicted him of financial misappropriation and other acts against the oath of office. He directed the Secretary to the State Government, Dr Kenneth Ugbala, to take over the office in acting capacity. The governor equally ordered the Head of Service, Dr Chamberlain Nwele, to discipline Nwakpu as a civil servant based on civil service rules. The FRC report read partly, “That Dr Cletus Nwakpu did not release to the farmers the complete agricultural inputs which they paid for and has failed to refund the payment so made. “That the sum of ninety-one thousand naira (N91,000) was paid for one unit of rice machine, but was neither supplied nor the amount refunded to the farmers.”
