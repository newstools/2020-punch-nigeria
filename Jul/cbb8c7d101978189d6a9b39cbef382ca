Tottenham’s Eric Dier has received a four-match ban and been fined £40,000 for climbing into the stands to confront a supporter after his side’s FA Cup exit to Norwich. The England international has been sanctioned by the Football Association on a charge of misconduct for the incident, which happened on March 4. Dier, whose team had just lost a penalty shootout, saw his brother being abused by a fan and raced to his aid. There was no physical exchange and the matter was not pursued by the police after a brief investigation. However, the FA opted to punish Dier.

He recently said he did not expect Dier to receive any punishment after the FA chose not to sanction Arsenal’s Matteo Guendouzi for grabbing Brighton striker Neal Maupay around the neck. Dier’s absence will be a blow for Spurs in their pursuit of European football next season who has been the first choice in central defence since the season restarted last month.
