Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi The Nigeria Customs Service has warned its newly promoted officers to shun indolence and other acts that are capable of bringing the service to disrepute. The Comptroller, Federal Operations Unit, Zone ‘D’ Bauchi, Adesanmi Omiye, stated this during the decoration of 68 newly promoted officers of the Bauchi zonal office. Omiye urged the officers to work hard in discharging their duties, adding that there is always a reward at the end of every hard work. He said: “We are congratulating you today, I pray that you will not give us the cause to chastise you tomorrow because promotion demands more responsibility from you. “Your actions now are expected to be more proactive. Mistakes will not be tolerated. Some of you have entered the management level, so there are certain things that you have to do away with. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
