Adelani Adepegba and Bola Bamigbola The Federal Government has declared Thursday, July 30, and Friday, July 31, 2020, as public holidays to mark this year’s Eid-el-Kabir celebration. The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, disclosed this in Abuja on Tuesday, in a statement signed by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Mrs Georgina Ehuriah. The minister congratulated Muslim faithful and all Nigerians both at home and abroad on the occasion. He called on the Muslims to continue to imbibe the spirit of love, peace, kindness and sacrifice, “as exemplified by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon Him)” and to also use the period to pray for peace, unity, prosperity and the stability of the country, especially as the world continues to witness global health challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Aregbesola promised that the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), was fully committed to battling the scourge with the cooperation of all Nigerians. Meanwhile, the Osun State Government, on Tuesday, announced the cancellation of Eid congregational prayers on Friday. It, however, said Juma’at service would hold in line with existing COVID-19 safety protocols and guidelines in the state. A statement by the Secretary to the State Government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, titled: ‘COVID-19: Osun cancels Eid Prayers’, indicated that the state was still recording rising figures of confirmed COVID-19 cases amidst an active community transmission stage of the pandemic.
