Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on Thursday called on members of the public to discountenance reports of a possible fire outbreak from a vandalised point on its pipeline at Aboru Canal in Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos. It said there was no such hazard as the line in question had since been shut down for repairs and presently contains only water. The corporation explained in a statement that the Atlas Cove-Mosimi stretch of the System 2B Pipeline was shut down on June 25 to enable comprehensive maintenance of some segments of the pipeline. It said the repair work was on the last stage of completion which involves hydro-testing, a process of pumping of water through the entire pipeline for integrity test and leak detection, to ascertain availability of the pipeline for pumping products. The oil firm urged residents of the affected community to remain calm as there was no possibility of fire erupting from the leakage point. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
