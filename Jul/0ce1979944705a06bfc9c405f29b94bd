Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta A mob on Saturday set ablaze a Dangote truck for killing one motorcyclist and injuring three others. The incident happened around 8 am on the Old Ibadan Roundabout Road, Ago-Iwoye, in the Ijebu-North Local Government Area of Ogun State. The accident involved the truck and a motorcycle, said the Public Relations Officer of the Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps, Babatunde Akinbiyi. Akinbiyi said the truck driver lost control of the vehicle and ran over the moving motorcycle, killing the rider and injuring three others. Irked by the incident, protesters thronged the road and set ablaze the truck while the driver was reportedly beaten. The driver was later rescued from the clutches of the mob by security operatives. Akinbiyi in a statement explained that the Dangote truck driver was coming from Ago-Iwoye inbound Ijebu-Ode when the incident happened. He said, “The driver, due to overspeeding, could not control the vehicle as it approached Ibadan roundabout and rammed over a Bajaj motorcycle rider who was trying to negotiate the roundabout at that time. “The driver of the Dangote truck was later apprehended after making attempts to run away and was beaten to stupor by the angry mob that also set the truck on fire. “But for the intervention of TRACE, Police, NSCDC, and the FRSC, the driver would have been killed and the truck would have been completely burnt down. “The driver has been arrested and taken to Igbeba Motor Traffic Division, Ijebu-Ode, as well as the motor boy. “The body of the deceased has been deposited at the mortuary of Femtop Hospital, Ijebu-Ode, GRA.” Akinbiyi, who sympathised with the family of the deceased, urged drivers of articulated vehicles to be more responsible when driving, adding that they avoid speeding especially when approaching bends, corners or roundabouts.
