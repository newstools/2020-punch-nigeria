Maiharaji Altine, Gusau GOVERNOR Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State has declared that the issue of banditry in Nigeria will come to an end if bandits in Zamfara can be eliminated. Matawalle, who made this remark on Thursday when he received the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, who was in the state for a one-day working visit, said, “Zamfara State is the epicentre of bandits in the country.” The governor said, “Once the bandits in Zamfara are dealt with, the issue of banditry in the country would be over.” Matawalle said 90 per cent of the bandits in the country were based in the state. “Most of the bandits live in Zamfara State; as such, I advise that the security agents should as quickly as possible block all the borders in the state and give final blow to these notorious bandits,” Matawalle added. According to him, Zamfara bandits were responsible for most of the attacks carried out in the state and other neighbouring states of Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi and even in Kaduna. In his response, the IG said he was sent by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to investigate the killings by bandits. “Worried by the incessant killings, the President instructed me to come to Zamfara in order to know what needs to be done to stop banditry. We are aware of how weapons come into the country and we are doing all we can to stop that,” he said . Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
