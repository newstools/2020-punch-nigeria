Rivers State Governor, Mr Nyesom Wike, has reportedly intervened in the alleged invasion of the home of former acting Managing Director, Niger Delta Development Commission, Joy Nunieh, in Port Harcourt. In a video that surfaced online, armed security operatives were seen surrounding the home of Nunieh. A House of Representatives’ Committee had invited Nunieh to appear before it today in Abuja, according to Channels TV.
