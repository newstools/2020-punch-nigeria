Johnny Edward The chances of Kelechi Iheanacho and Wilfred Ndidi featuring in next season UEFA Champions League suffered another setback on Sunday as Leicester City lost 3-0 at Tottenham Hotspur. Ndidi, who was handed his 31st start of the season, was replaced on 70 minutes for Nampalys Mendy, while Iheanacho came on for Ayoze Perez in the 59th minute for his eighth substitute (19th eighth of the season) appearance, but could not add to his tally of five league goals for the Foxes. Iheanacho has failed to score in his last three games. James Justin’s own goal and a brace from Harry Kane secured a third consecutive win for Spurs. In the English Championship, Eberechi Eze bagged his 13th league goal of the season for Queens Park Rangers who edged Millwall 4-3 in a seven-goal thriller at Loftus Road. The game was Eze’s 43rd of the season. Eze, who featured for 90 minutes, scored in the 62nd minute to put QPR 3-1 ahead. His Nigerian teammate Bright Osayi-Samuel was not in QPR’s squad for the encounter due to his imminent exit from the club. Leon Balogun was also in action for Wigan Athletic, who drew 2-2 at Charlton Athletic. The defender, who is on loan from Brighton, saw action for 90 minutes in what was his ninth game for the Lactics. At Ewood Park, Nigerian duo, Sone Aluko and Ovie Ejaria missed Reading’s 4-3 loss to Blackburn Rovers. In Spain, Samuel Chukwueze made his 36th LaLiga appearances for Villarreal in Sunday’s home clash against Eibar. The Nigerian has scored three times in the league and provided five assists.
