Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan A former Minister of Education, Prof Tunde Adeniran, has called on the Federal Ministry of Education to constitute inspection panels to visit universities, assess their level of preparedness for resumption and give clearance to any of them that has satisfied the requirements for reopening. Adeniran also said government should make sure that measures to prevent COVID-19 were put in place in primary and secondary schools and reopen them. He said this in an interview with The PUNCH in Ibadan on Sunday. Adeniran, who is also a former Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, said students should not be kept at home forever because of COVID-19 because technology was available to defeat the pandemic. The former minister said, “My position is that the government should make sure that they put everything in order. We are in the age of technology where we cannot be defeated by what is happening, we should be anticipating things. We must not put the lives of our children in danger and at the same time we cannot afford to keep them out of school perpetually. “Nobody knows when this COVID-19 will be over; so what we need to do is to tackle it and defeat it. If we are serious enough the government should be able to put in place sufficient measures to guarantee the safety of our children.” .Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
