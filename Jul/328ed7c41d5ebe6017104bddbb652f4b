Kayode Oyero The Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, on Monday, accused the House of Representatives Committee investigating financial mismanagement in the Niger Delta Development Commission, of bullying him. The House is presently grilling Akpabio as the supervising minister of the NDDC. The investigative hearing is being held at the Conference Room 231 of the House.
