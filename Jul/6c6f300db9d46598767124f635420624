Peter Dada, Akure The immediate former Secretary to the Ondo State Government, Mr Sunday Abegunde, on Tuesday said he had no plan to join the Peoples Democratic Party. Abegunde resigned from the administration of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu on Monday, alleging that the governor maltreated him. The former SSG, who spoke in Akure on Tuesday, said his resignation had not translated to defection, maintaining that he was still a member of the All Progressives Congress. He said, “I am not defecting to the PDP, I remain a loyal member of the APC. “I have decided to team up with Segun Abraham, who will be a good leader and caring governor. I decided to dump Akeredolu because he incapacitated me; he does not have welfare of the party and the people at heart. “I am a loyal party man, I will still support whoever wins the ticket of the party. But if Akeredolu wins the ticket, I will only support my party not Akeredolu.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
