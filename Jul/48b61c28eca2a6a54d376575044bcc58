Fernandes’s superb form has continued this month as he scored against Bournemouth and then again, from the spot, in the 3-0 win at Aston Villa on Thursday night, and also supplied the assist from a corner for Paul Pogba’s strike. He won our Player of the Month prize for June and looks set to be a strong contender again in a few weeks’ time as he bids to win it for the fourth time in a row.
