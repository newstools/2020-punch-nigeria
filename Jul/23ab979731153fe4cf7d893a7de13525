John Alechenu, Abuja THE Peoples Democratic Party has asked the All Progressives Congress to prepare for imminent defeat in the September 10 Edo State governorship elections. It also said the APC and its candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, should perish the thought of rigging the elections just as it advised the party to desist from fabricating reports aimed at arm-twisting the Independent National Electoral Commission into manipulating the outcome of the elections. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘You can’t rig Edo election, PDP mocks APC, Ize-Iyamu …Urges APC to desist from fabrications,’ signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbodiyan, in Abuja, on Thursday. The PDP alleged that the APC was plotting to “use fabrications in a section of the media to arm-twist the Independent National Electoral Commission, to manipulate the Edo state governorship elections for their rejected candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu.” Ologbondiyan said, “In sponsoring fake reports that PDP leaders were putting pressure on INEC Chairman, Prof. Yakubu Mahmood, on the Edo election, the APC has further exposed its hopelessness over their rejection by the Edo people and now seeks to blackmail the commission.” Copyright PUNCH.
