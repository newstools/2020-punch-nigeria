The younger brother of Tottenham defender Serge Aurier was killed in a shooting in Toulouse on Monday, according to a police source. When emergency services arrived on the scene at 5:00 am local time (0300 GMT), the 26-year-old was injured in the abdomen and he later died in hospital, the fire service said. A source close to the investigation said the gunman fled. According to local radio, the victim was Christopher Aurier, who plays for French fifth-division team Toulouse Rodeo. He came through the youth academy at Lens like his older brother, an Ivorian international and former Paris Saint-Germain full-back, but failed to breakthrough at the highest level. (AFP)
