Chukwudi Akasike THE Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra has cautioned politicians from the South-East not to waste their funds on the 2023 presidency, insisting that having a President of Nigeria from the region was impossible. MASSOB’s National Director of Information, Mr. Sunday Okereafor, stated that the plot to ensure that no Igbo would ever assume the position of President began after the civil war. Speaking in a telephone interview with The PUNCH on Wednesday, Okereafor explained that any Igbo, who decided to gun for the presidency in 2023, would only be wasting his or her money. “Those people calling them to be ready for the presidency are not sincere. We know that it will turn out to be a waste of funds and a waste of time. The Igbo will never rule Nigeria; so, the Igbo politicians should avoid wasting their money. “Alex Ekwueme tried it and failed, Rochas Okorocha went and failed, Ogbonnaya Onu went there and failed. Also, Odumegwu Ojukwu tried the presidency and failed; a lot of Igbo tried it and failed,” he said. Okereafor urged Igbo youths to engage themselves in meaningful ventures and shun any politician from Igbo extraction seeking their support for Igbo presidency. He pointed out that some Igbo in government only went there to get money, saying nobody will take them seriously when the time to occupy critical positions in government comes. Copyright PUNCH.
