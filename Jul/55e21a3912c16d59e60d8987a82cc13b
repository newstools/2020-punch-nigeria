Kayode Oyero An accident involving two fuel tankers on Friday morning stalled movement along Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The accident, which occurred around the Kara Bridge section of the highway, saw motorists stranded through the stretch of the road from the Berger area of Lagos State to Mowe in Ogun State. It was gathered that first responders have since arrived at the scene and cordoned off the site to prevent a secondary occurrence. One of the tankers carrying diesel has been recovered but efforts are on to remove the one carrying petrol, Lagos Information Commissioner, Gbenga Omotoso, said in a statement. He added, “As a result of this, the section of the road leading to Mowe from New Garage (Ojodu-Berger) has been cordoned off to prevent a secondary accident while contraflow is in place to reduce delays. “All Traffic Management, Security and Emergency Management Agencies are on the scene managing the incident and traffic to reduce delays and ensure the safety of all.”
