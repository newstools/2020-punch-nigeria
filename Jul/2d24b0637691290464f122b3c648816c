Mobola Sadiq Controversy has continued to trail the reported order by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, to the National Broadcasting Commission to shut down the Big Brother Naija reality television show. The Acting Director-General of the NBC, Armstrong Idachaba, had allegedly told senior management members of the commission at a meeting during the week that he had been directed by the minister to shut down the show due to the coronavirus pandemic. MultiChoice Limited had subsequently replied the NBC stating the measures taken to forestall any violation of the COVID-19 protocols advised by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, adding that the Lagos State Safety Commission gave approval for the show. Meanwhile, Nigerians on Twitter have expressed diverse views on the matter. @VirginSearcher tweeted, “I’m not his fan/APC fan but this one, I support it because it’s a very useless show. How can one sit at home every day watching people seated in a house doing rubbish and waiting to cash out if successful. What is my gain? It is a very hopeless show. Pure waste of time.” @NwokwuIzunna said, “Nigerian youths. None of them is agitating for school reopening. They are here crying foul over the cancellation of that rubbish show that adds nothing to us. There’s no talent hunt there.” @diiphillipo wrote, “A group of people that are suffering the problems brought upon them by the people who wants to ban BBN. Scores are dying in Southern Kaduna and SARS is making mincemeat of Southern youths. The man with whom the buck stops rather went to Mali.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
