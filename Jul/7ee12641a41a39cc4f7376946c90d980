The Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has said the Peoples Democratic can win the elections in the Ondo and Ekiti stated if members are united. Astatement on Wednesday said the governor spoke at the first year anniversary of the PDP South-West United Kingdom chapter via webinar on Monday July 20, 2020, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The PDP South West UK chapter was inaugurated July 20, 2019. The governor said. “We need to restore the PDP’s lost glory and pride by refocusing, egrouping, and restrategising.  Since taking oath of office, my priority has been to bring factions together. “We lost in Ekiti state and Ondo states because the party was not united. The future of the PDP can still be revived in the South-West if the party unite and rebuild their differences.” “The upcoming elections in Ondo and Ekiti states within the next few months will be crucial in restoring public confidence.”
