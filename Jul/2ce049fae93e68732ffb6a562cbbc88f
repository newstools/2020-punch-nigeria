Nike Popoola the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria says it has rescheduled its April diet examinations to hold along with the October diet examinations. A statement by the Head Corporate Communication and External Relations, Mr Nelson Olagundoye, said the examination was rescheduled to ensure the safety of the students and other stakeholders that would participate in it. He said the decision to reschedule the examination was in line with the uncertainty surrounding the full relaxation of the measures imposed by the federal and state governments to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. “The institute regrets the inconvenience caused to the candidates who had registered for the April 2020 examinations and spent time preparing,” it said. CIBN noted that it postponed the examinations indefinitely on March 21, 2020 as a result of the pandemic, which forced governments to introduce stringent measures such as social, physical distancing protocol, limitation of gatherings to a maximum of 20 people and total lockdown of economic and social activities. By this decision, it means the institute’s examinations will hold only once this year at a date tentatively fixed for October 6-8, 2020. The institute advised all the students intending to write the examinations to register on its website. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
