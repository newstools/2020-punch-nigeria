Dayo Ojerinde The South West Regional Manager, Marie Stopes International Organisation Nigeria, Mr. Abimbola Faloye, has said maternal deaths are preventable through combined safe motherhood strategies of focused antenatal care, immediate postpartum care and access to family planning. Faloye said this during the presentation of maternal health medications, misoclear, to the Lagos State Ministry of Health by the organisation in its bid to stop postpartum hemorrhage in the state. He said the high maternal mortality ratio of the country was worrisome, calling on all stakeholders to unite to end it. According to the World Health Organisation, in 2015, Nigeria’s estimated maternal mortality ratio was over 800 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. “With this donation, we are contributing to the prevention of the needless deaths of women from bleeding after childbirth, one of the leading causes of maternal deaths in Nigeria. Most factors causing maternal deaths are preventable through combined safe motherhood strategies of focused antenatal care, immediate post-partum care and access to family planning”. “We are supporting Nigeria’s effort at meeting the United Nation’s goal of reducing global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100, 000 live births by 2030,” Faloye said. The Director, Family Health and Nutrition, Lagos State Ministry of Health, Dr. Folasade Oludara, while receiving the products on behalf of the Ministry, said maternal and child health was a key health area of focus for the state government. She said the donated products would be distributed to health facilities across the state where they would be administered to save the lives of women needing it. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
