Afeez Hanafi Dwellers of a three-storey building on Abeokuta Street, Ebute Metta, Lagos, were lucky on Friday when the structure collapsed. The incident occurred around 1pm when most of the residents had gone to work, sparing them of a serious tragedy that might have happened if the building had collapsed when they were home. Two kids and a policewoman had died when a three-storey building on Freeman Street, Lagos Island, fell on a bungalow around 2am on Saturday, July 11. Commenting on the Ebute Metta incident, the General Manager, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, said a woman was rescued from the rubble and rushed to a hospital. He said no life was lost, adding that the cause of the building collapse would be investigated. He stated, “The agency received a distress call at 1.10pm. Upon arrival at the scene of the incident, it was discovered that a three-storey building collapsed as a result of yet-to-be determined cause. Fortunately, the incident happened when most of the residents had gone to work. “Search, rescue and recovery operations were carried out and an adult female of about 30-year-old was rescued from the rubble using the agency’s DELSA equipment. She has been transferred to hospital. The area has been cordoned off and adjacent buildings are being checked for any damage.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
