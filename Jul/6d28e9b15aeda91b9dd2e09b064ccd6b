Kayode Oyero Fire on Saturday morning gutted a tanker loaded with 46,000 litres of petrol at the Secretariat Bus Stop in the Alausa area of Lagos State. It was gathered that the incident happened around 1 am and the head of the truck was badly burnt by the fire. But tragedy was averted when first responders drafted to the scene put out the fire before any probable explosion of the liquid content. No life was lost and no injury recorded, said Lagos State Emergency Management Agency spokesperson, Nosa Okunbor, in a statement. Explaining how the operation was conducted, Okunbor said, “While the fire in the engine compartment was being attacked, the tanker portion was being blanketed simultaneously to keep the temperature of the content stable and safe.” He added, “The fire was put out successfully by the combined efforts of the LASEMA Response Team, as well, as men of the Lagos State Fire Services. “The fire affected only the head of the tanker. No spillage was observed. Efforts were made to take the affected tanker off the road with the use of the Agency’s Super metro. “The affected oil tanker has been towed-off the road to a safe place nearby. The road is now free for vehicular activities.”
