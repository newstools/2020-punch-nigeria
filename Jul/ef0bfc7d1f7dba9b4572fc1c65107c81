Samson Folarin The Lagos State Government has started a weekly distribution of food packs to indigent pregnant women to encourage attendance at the state health care facilities. The wife of the state governor, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, flagged off the initiative, tagged, Mother, Infant and Child programme, on Tuesday at the Igbogbo/Baiyeku Local Council Development Area. According to Mrs Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by Mrs Funmi Omotosho, the pilot scheme will be in 11 local government and local council development areas, which are Ikeja, Badagry, Epe, Ikorodu, Agege, Lagos-Island, Eti-Osa, Alimosho, Shomolu, Kosofe and Ibeju. She said, “This MICH, in the short-term, will reduce the incidence of abysmally low attendance of expectant mothers at the state government’s primary and secondary health facilities for their pre-natal clinics occasioned by the economic hardship in the society. “The social, health and economic benefits of the programme are enormous. The food pack, which will be given to expectant mothers during their weekly pre-natal visits, will contain the essential food and vitamins needed for the expectant mothers’ well-being and apt development of the baby’s brain, even from the womb. “This will not only encourage attendance of the indigent pregnant women at our primary health facilities, but will enhance delivery of healthy babies with well-developed brains as well as reduce neonatal, infant and maternal mortality among the target group.” Copyright PUNCH.
