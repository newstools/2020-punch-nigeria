Peter Dada, Akure The recent governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress in Ondo State has been generating reactions as one of the aspirants in the primary, Isaac Kekemeke, has condemned the outcome of the election. Kekemeke, who was a former chairman of the party in the state, alleged that the election was predetermined, making the election not to be fair. The former APC aspirant scored 19 votes behind Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, who won with 2458 votes, and Olusola Oke who scored 262 votes. Speaking in Akure, the state capital on Tuesday, Kekemeke said, “It is still my conviction that the process leading to the voting was slanted, skewed and compromised to produce a predetermined result. “The advantages and opportunities that incumbency confer were overstretched to constitute the incumbent into both an umpire and a contestant.” READ ALSO: Gbajabiamila gives Akpabio 48 hours to name lawmakers who received NDDC contracts He, however, vowed not to go to court to challenge the process but would abide by the position of the party on the matter. “I have been approached by some persons and groups to run my aspiration on their platforms. Others have advised that I challenge the process in court. My answer; I remain in the All Progressives Congress and I shall not be going to court. “The delegates have spoken clearly and so be it. I wish the winner and our party well,” Kekemeke submitted.
