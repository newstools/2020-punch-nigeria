Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta A truck owner, identified as Fatai Salami, has committed suicide  after his truck was seized by officials of the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps for flouting COVID-19 laws in the state. Salami reportedly drank an insecticide, snippers, on the premises of the TRACE  after he was asked to pay N215,000 for flouting COVID-19 law in the state. A source told our correspondent that TRACE officials seized the deceased’s  truck from his driver   in Abeokuta on Thursday for flouting social distancing order and failure to use face mask . He was said to have gone to the premises of TRACE and pleaded for the release of  his  truck, but failed to get his truck back . According to the source, he had been sleeping on the premises since Thursday until Monday when he was able to raise a sum of N150,000, which was rejected. The source said the man threatened to  kill himself, but was not taken seriously until he drank the snippers and died . The Public Relations Officer of TRACE, Babatunde Akinbiyi, confirmed the death of the man. He said, “The man was neither a truck driver not a truck owner. We only saw him there, he sat on the floor  and the people asked him to stand up and as he stood up he brought out  something from his pocket and drank it. “We later discovered that it was snipper that he drank. He was rushed to the General Hospital, where he gave up the ghost. The case has  been reported to the police.” Akinbiyi  denied that the man was fined. “He was neither a driver nor a truck owner; what he came here to do we don’t know,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
