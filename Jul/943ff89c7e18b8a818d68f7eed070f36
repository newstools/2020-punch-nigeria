Johnny Edward Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti has left out Nigerian duo Sunday Oliseh and Mikel Obi from his all-time best 11 players he’s coached. Oliseh worked with Ancelotti at Juventus during the 1999/00 season. Mikel was one of his midfield stalwarts during his two-year spell at Chelsea, where they both won the Premier League and FA Cup titles. The squad, which has a large number of Serie A stars, also excludes Cristiano Ronaldo, Filipo Inzaghi, Del Pierio and Didier Drogba. Ancelotti, who has won silverware in Italy, Spain, England, Germany and France, listed Cafu, Paolo Maldini, Andrea Pirlo, Kaka and Andriy Shevchenko in his ideal 11, according to British tabloid, The Sun. Thiago Silva and Zlatan Ibrahimovic were also listed in the squad. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
