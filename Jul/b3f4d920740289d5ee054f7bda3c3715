Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has described the judiciary as the last hope of the common man. This follows the Appeal Court’s decision affirming his victory at the November 16 governorship poll. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the Court of Appeal in Abuja on Saturday affirmed the governor’s re-election after dismissing four appeals challenging his victory at the poll. In separate judgments all of which were unanimous, the five-man panel of the court led by Justice Adamu Jauro dismissed the four appeals for lacking in merit. The appeals dismissed were filed by the Peoples Democratic Party, the Actions People’s Party, the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic People’s Party. Among the four appeals, the one filed by the PDP along with its governorship candidate, Musa Wada, was the most keenly fought.
