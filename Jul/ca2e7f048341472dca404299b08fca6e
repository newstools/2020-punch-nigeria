Kelvin Ekerete Crotone striker, Simeon Nwankwo, will be hoping to find the back of the net when they face 19th-place Trapani in their final game of the season to improve his chances of ending the season as top scorer in Serie B. Nwankwo played an important role in helping his side return to the elite division as they are billed to finish second on the league table behind champions Benevento. The Nigerian, who is Serie B’s current top scorer with 20 goals, is closely followed by Perugia’s Pietro Iemmello on 19 goals. The Italian will be hoping to score when they play 13th-placed Venezia. Nwankwo has been the most clinical striker in the league, scoring 13 goals at home while finding the back of the net seven times away from home. Crotone, according to reports in Italy recently rejected an offer from Udinese for the 28-year-old. The Calabrian club want to hold on to the striker to help them navigate the Serie A. Crotone spent two seasons in the lower league after they were relegated in the 2017/18 league season, finishing 18th on the table. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
