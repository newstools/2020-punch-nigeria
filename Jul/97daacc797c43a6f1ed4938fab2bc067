Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday dismissed a suit filed by five deregistered political parties seeking the restoration of their registration which was cancelled by the Independent National Electoral Commission in February this year. The five deregistered parties are, the Nigeria Community Movement Party, Liberation Movement, United Peoples Congress, Democratic Peoples Congress and Movement For Restoration and Defence of Democracy. Earlier this week, Justice Nkeoye Ojukwu also of the Federal High Court in Abuja, upheld the deregistration of the  Democratic People’s Party and the Reform and Advancement  Party. The parties were among the 74 deregistered by INEC on February 6, 2020. They were deregistered for their inability to meet the minimum constitutional requirements of election victories in the 2019 poll as stipulated in Section 225(a) of the Nigerian Constitution. Since February the Federal High Court had through its various judges upheld the deregistration of at least 40 of the 74 affected political parties. Justice Anwuri Chikere of the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday dismissed the case filed by NCMP, LM, UPC, DPC and MRDD to challenge their deregistration. The court in its judgment held that INEC justifiably deregistered the plaintiffs for breach of Section 225 (a) of the Nigerian Constitution by failing to meet the minimum conditions stipulated in it.
