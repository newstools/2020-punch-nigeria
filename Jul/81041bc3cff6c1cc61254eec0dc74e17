The Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Mr Mudashiru Obasa, has commiserated with the family of late Tunde Braimoh who died on Friday, saying that his death hit him “like thunder.” Obasa, who is also the chairman, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures in Nigeria, made this known in a condolence message in Lagos on Saturday. The News Agency of Nigeria reported that the late Braimoh was the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Security and Strategy. Obasa said, “It has been over 24 hours, yet I am still in search of the right words to portray how I feel currently. It did not come like a lightening. “No. It hit me like thunder. Maybe, maybe worse than that. Or how best can one describe the blow death brought upon us with the sudden demise of Hon. Tunde Braimoh? “How best can I understand that one backbone of the Lagos State House of Assembly has been expunged, not even like something taken away temporarily to be returned someday?
