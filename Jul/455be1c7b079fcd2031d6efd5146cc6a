Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin The Commissioner for Special Duties in Kwara State, Hajia Aisha Ahman-Pategi, has debunked reports accusing the state Ministry of Finance of withdrawing N300m local government fund. Speaking with journalists in Ilorin on Monday, Ahman-Pategi said, “I never made a pronouncement like that nor did I ask anyone to write or say anything like that on my behalf. These are rumours which were formed by figment of bloggers’ imagination.” Recall that that the accusation had reportedly led to argument between the Finance Commissioner, Mrs Florence Oyeyemi, and Ahman-Pategi, who until recently was the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs in the state. The state governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, had last week invited the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to probe funds so far disbursed to the 16 councils in the state. Ahman-Pategi said, “I urge the general public to disregard the rumours of financial misappropriation of N300m local government funds. The LGA fund is intact. All write-ups circulating online or in conventional media attributing such claims to me are lies orchestrated by naysayers that I call propagandists.” “I also want to clear the air on the report that Mrs Oyeyemi and I engaged in fisticuffs. Again, these are frivolous claims by bloggers. It is false and unfounded and need to be disregarded. We never exchanged blows.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
