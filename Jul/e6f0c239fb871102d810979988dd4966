Raphael Ede, Enugu The Peoples Democratic Party has threatened to expel any member found wanting in the party’s chances to reclaim Anambra State in the 2021 governorship election. The PDP’s National Vice Chairman, South East, Chief Austin Umahi, gave  the warning while speaking with journalists in Enugu. Umahi alleged that some party members in Anambra State were instrumental to the party’s failure since 2006 till date. He threatened to invoke the party’s constitution to expel any party member found wanting in its responsibility, as he claimed that the party was ready to reclaim the state. He said, “Without mincing words, we are resolute, we are determined, we are dogged that Anambra State is the PDP state.  A state where you have many House of Rep members and two senators. We have House of Assembly members, so what is remaining is the government house, and that is our target. We are determined as zonal officers to take charge of Anambra State. “If we see you as an incorrigible child, you will go to another party. We have capacity to do it and we will not hesitate to do it. The most important thing is that many have accepted to work together to reclaim Anambra State government house which is our destination and determination. It is our resolution and we are not going back. “But we know that there are some people that have set out because it is like a tradition that once there is an incoming election in Anambra State, you will begin to see litigations, but I want to warn if you are a member of PDP and you do not withdraw all those litigations and court orders, we will not hesitate to expel you from the party.” Copyright PUNCH.
