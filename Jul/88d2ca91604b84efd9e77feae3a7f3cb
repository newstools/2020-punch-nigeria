Peter David, Benin City Youths, under the aegis of the Edo Youth Solidarity Movement, have thrown their weight behind the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, in the September 19 governorship election in the state. They expressed confidence that his SIMPLE manifesto would create jobs and improve the economy of the state if implemented. Speaking on behalf of the youth during a courtesy visit to Ize-Iyamu, the Edo-South and Edo-North leaders of the group, John Izegaegbe and Godwin Aigbokhaode, respectively, stated that they had started mobilising youths across the three senatorial districts to garner votes for the APC candidate. “We are assuring the APC candidate and other members of the All Progressives Congress that in addition to the guaranteed votes from thousands of our members across the three senatorial districts, we have commenced mobilisation efforts in all the 18 LGAs to garner more votes on September 19,” they stated. Responding, Ize-Iyamu lamented the state of the economy and the declining level of employment and economic opportunities for the youth. He said, “Instead of empowering our youths and exploring all opportunities to positively engage them, the governor continues to denigrate and insult them as ‘agberos’. “Many of you here are well-read, qualified, and competent enough to handle complex tasks and projects. Instead of patronising you, the governor insults you and chooses to do his business elsewhere.” Also addressing the youths, a former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, said with their number, he had no fear of victory in the election.
