Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Workers at the headquarters of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission on Thursday protested against what they described as poor working conditions at the NIPC. It was gathered that the protest disrupted work activities at the commission for hours, as the workers stopped visitors from gaining entry into the commission’s building in Abuja. The Chairman of the workers’ union, Yusuf Mustapha, alleged that workers of the NIPC were poorly treated by the commission’s Executive Secretary, Ms Yewande Sadiku. But the commission, in a reaction, expressed concern at the unexpected protests and grounding of work activities by the protesters. It argued in a statement that it had always made staff welfare and development a priority, as welfare improvements were initiated by management without being prompted. The commission argued that it had introduced productivity allowance to reward employees, particularly when set targets were achieved. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
