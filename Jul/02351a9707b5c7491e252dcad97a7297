’Tana Aiyejina Pay TV operator, StarTimes, has acquired the rights to broadcast LaLiga matches live on its platform in Nigeria from next season, The PUNCH reports. The news comes as relief for the country’s teeming football populace, millions of whom are followers of LaLiga, as the latest development affords them the chance to watch live Spanish top-tier league matches on the platform of StarTimes. It also brings to an end the exclusivity clause in live sports content broadcasting rights in Nigeria, after stakeholders had clamoured for its removal. In January, the Federal Government prohibited exclusivity rights in broadcasting sporting events in the country. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, directed the National Broadcasting Commission to implement a new regulation mandating broadcasters and exclusive licensees to share such exclusive rights with other broadcasters. Mohammed stated, “This regulation prevents the misuse of monopoly or market power or anti-competitive and unfair practices by a foreign or local broadcaster to suppress other local broadcaster in the television and radio markets. “This is so, having removed exclusivity from all content in Nigeria and mandated the sharing of all content upon the payment of commercially viable fees.” StarTimes’ entry into LaLiga is expected to redefine the Pay TV sector and further attract more Nigerians to the league, which boasts some of the biggest names like Lionel Messi, Sergio Ramos, Jan Oblak, Luiz Suarez in world football, a top stakeholder told our correspondent. “Their (StarTimes) affordable pricing, when compared to the other major players in the sector, will bring a competitive edge,” our source said.
