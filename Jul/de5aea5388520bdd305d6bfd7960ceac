Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The review of petrol price should not be solely managed by the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency, oil marketers said on Sunday. Since March 19, 2020, the PPPRA had been releasing guiding prices for Premium Motor Spirit (petrol) after it declared that the downstream oil sector had been deregulated. But oil marketers under the aegis of the Petroleum Products Retail Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria said on Sunday that  the PPPRA should involve other stakeholders while modulating PMS price . The President, PETROAN, Billy Gillis-Harry, said a stakeholders meeting involving leaders of the various oil and gas marketing associations and government representatives should be constituted to determine the price changes.
