Temiloluwa O’Peters The Architects Registration Council of Nigeria has said it planned to induct 50 architects and 10 firms that are registered and licensed to practise architecture in Nigeria. The association disclosed this in a statement issued by the President, ARCON, Dipo Ajayi, on Saturday, with the title ‘ARCON will hold 9th induction ceremony’. Ajayi said the induction would be done virtually, adding that the council deemed it necessary to think outside the box. While urging Nigerian architects not to be indifferent in their professional calling, he urged the new architects to see beyond today. He said the council would continue to respond positively towards lifting architectural practice in Nigeria and beyond. Ajayi, who wished the inductees success in their chosen field, urged them to strive towards developing entrepreneurial skills without compromising professionalism. He said the council had arranged to give certificates to the inductees at the council’s nearest office to them. The president said, ‘’Architects are leaders in the construction industry all over the world and Nigerian architects can’t afford to be indifferent. ‘’Our council will continue to work ahead of time to position newly registered architects and indeed all architects at a vantage standing.’’ Ajayi, who noted that the challenge of COVID-19 had greatly impacted every sector of the economy, said it had made ARCON go extra mile in delivering its mandate. According to him, the mandate entails licensing of architects, regulation of architectural practice and improving the standards of architectural education. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
