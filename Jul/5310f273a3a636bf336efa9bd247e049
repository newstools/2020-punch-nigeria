Kelvin Ekerete Nigerian striker, Taiwo Awoniyi, has thanked German referee, Marco Fritz, whose quick reaction and first aid helped save his life after colliding with Augsburg defender, Felix Uduokhai, in a German Bundesliga match on June 14. Awoniyi was left unconscious in the 18-yard box but the situation was quickly handled by Fritz, before the arrival of the club’s medical team. The 22-year-old, who has returned to full fitness, says the referee was sent by God to save his life. “I must commend the referee, medical staff, they did a great job and I think even my teammates were not conscious of it, only the referee was aware, something must have pushed him to know that someone is on the ground, and for me that’s God,” he told Omasports. Awoniyi says he has reached out to the referee personally to thank him. “Yes, I did (call him afterward). I requested his number from my agent, so I texted him, expressing how grateful I am to him and he responded saying he’s happy he could help and he hopes to see me on the pitch again very soon.” The 2013 U-17 World Cup winner added that he received a message from Uduokhai asking about his health. “I don’t know how he got my number, he said ‘Taiwo I’m really sorry for what happened, I’m your brother and I hope you come back soon.’ This shows football is not just all about the competition, there’s so much love in it as well.” Copyright PUNCH.
