Peter Dada, Akure Ondo State Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, said on Sunday that he was instrumental to the victory of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and the All Progressives Congress in the 2016 governorship poll in the state. Ajayi, who has been at loggerheads with the governor before and after he left the APC and join the Peoples Democratic Party, was reacting to a statement by the governor that he was a wrong choice as a deputy. Akeredolu was said to have made the statement on Saturday at the meeting of the APC party delegates at Ese Odo Local Government Area. The governor reportedly said despite the criticism and attack from various quarters alleging that Ajayi was his cousin, he felt he made a wrong choice. However in a statement issued by his media aide, Tope Okeowo, the embattled deputy governor said such a statement from the governor could only come from a frustrated politician.
