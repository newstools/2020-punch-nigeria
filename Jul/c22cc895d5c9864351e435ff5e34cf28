Peter Dada, Akure Supporters of the All Progressives Congress in Ondo State, under the aegis of the Aketi Women Campaign Network, have urged Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, to pick a woman as his running mate in the forthcoming governorship election. Akerodolu is the APC candidate for the October 10, 2020, governorship election. The women, who staged a protest in Akure on Tuesday, decried what they alleged was the marginalisation of women in the state by successive administrations. The coordinator of the group, Dr Adebunmi Osadahun, said, “Since 1976, women have never been given a chance in politics in this state and we are always there. They use us during elections. “Many of us are used for singing and dancing during campaigns and on the election day, we are the highest number of voters, yet we have not been given higher positions. The governor should this time consider one of us as his running mate.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
