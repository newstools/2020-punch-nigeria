Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State Publicity Secretary of the Afenifere Renewal Group, Michael Ogungbemi, has urged the South-West leaders to convene a meeting of the progressive politicians within the geopolitical zone for unity. Ogungbemi also said that the leaders should, at the meeting, consider the possibility of presenting an acceptable candidate for the 2023 presidential election. Speaking in an interview with newsmen in Ado Ekiti on Sunday, he said the South-West had all it required to produce the nation’s president in 2023. He added that political leaders of the zone would be held responsible if the opportunity was allowed to slip. The ARG spokesperson said, “About 2023, the ARG had met and we concluded that the Yoruba nation is ready to lead Nigeria. We have a blueprint that we can present to any presidential candidate that can bring better democratic governance to all Nigerians. “The South-West is ready to take over. We have human and material resources. The political leaders must go on consultations. We have six geopolitical zones; South-West is just a bloc. Tinubu must lead this bloc. Also, luckily, Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, who is the Nigeria Governors’ Forum Chairman, is from the South-West. “They must move for a united family to clamour for presidency for the South-West and produce a unified front. If they can speak with one voice, we will actually clinch this ticket, because it is our turn.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
