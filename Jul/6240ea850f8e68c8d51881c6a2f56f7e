Matthew Ochei, Asaba A team of local vigilance groups have apprehended eight suspected kidnappers allegedly terrorising residents of Issele-Uku in the Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State. The Chairman, Issele-Uku Vigilance Group, Mr Nkeadi Obunwa, disclosed this on Saturday after a monthly meeting of all the vigilance groups in the area at the Unity Hall, Issele-Uku, the headquarters of the council. Obunwa said the groups worked in collaboration with the police. “We are helping the police and our efforts have yielded fruits,” he added. He called on the state government to support the guards with tools and incentives that would encourage them to do more. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the arrest, adding that the suspects had been handed over to the Issele-Uku Divisional Police Officer. She said, “Yes, eight persons were arrested. I called Issele-Uku DPO and he confirmed it. They went to raid and eight kidnappers were arrested, but the main person, who is the leader, is still at large.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
