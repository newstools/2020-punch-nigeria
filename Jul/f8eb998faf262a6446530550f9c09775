Johnny Edward Glasgow Rangers manager Steven Gerrard is pleased to have signed Leon Balogun and is confident the arrival of the defender will add depth to the Gers ahead of next season. Rangers announced the signing of Balogun on a one-year deal on friday, with the Gers having an option for a further year. The news comes 48 hours after The PUNCH reported that the 32-year-old was on the verge of joining a top Scottish club. Balogun joins Gers to add further competition in the centre of defence, following injury to Niko Katic. “I am pleased to secure the signature of Leon,” Gerrard told the club’s website. “He is an experienced centre half who will add strength and depth to our squad. “His experience in the Premier League as well as his international pedigree strengthens our squad and will assist in the development of our young defenders. “Leon has just finished a round of competitive fixtures with Wigan, so will hit the ground running. He’s a positive and bright character and we are looking forward to his influence around the group” Sporting Director Ross Wilson also added, “We quickly targeted Leon after adapting our transfer plan when Niko Katic suffered an injury a few weeks ago. “We agreed on terms with Leon shortly before going to France enabling Leon to give Wigan his full focus, particularly in the situation they found themselves in. “Leon impressed Steven and me with his enthusiasm and excitement to join Rangers from the moment we first spoke whilst the staff at Brighton and Wigan couldn’t have spoken any higher about his personality and abilities.” Copyright PUNCH.
