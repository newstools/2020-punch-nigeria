Striker Kelechi Iheanacho scored for the second consecutive game as Leicester City beat Crystal Palace 3-0 in their PremierLeague clash at the King Power Stadium on Saturday. The Nigerian grabbed the opener  in the 49th minute after he was set up by Youri Tielemans. Jamie Vardy’s double in the 77th minute and added time then ensured an emphatic win for the home side. Vardy’s brace took  his topflight tally to 101 to give Leicester their first win since the restart and boost their hopes of achieving a top-four Premier League finish. Iheanacho, who was replaced in the 64th minute by Dennis Praett, now has five goals in 16 EPL games for Leicester this season. Meanwhile, Foxes boss Brendan Rodgers said it was “a privilege” to work with Vardy after the striker’s “phenomenal achievement” of reaching 100 Premier League goals. “From the first moment I came here I told him I was happy he was here because he is a master finisher,” Rodgers said of the 33-year-old. “Sometimes these milestones can weigh on you a little but it was only going to be a matter of time before he reached it.”
