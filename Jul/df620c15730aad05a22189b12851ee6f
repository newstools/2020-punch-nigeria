Temiloluwa O’Peters The International Facility Management Association, Nigeria Chapter, has lauded the Federal Government’s initiative of handing over the National Theatre, Iganmu, Lagos to the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Banker’s Committee. According to a statement, entitled ‘IFMA Nigeria lauds Federal Government’s handover of National Theatre’, which was obtained on Friday, the acting President of the association, Segun Adebayo, said the development was  not only commendable but also a step in the right direction. According to him, the initiative of the government through the Ministry of Information and Culture, the CBN and the Banker’s Committee should also be extended to other national facilities such as the National Museum and National Stadium that had not been put into optimal use. While commending all parties including Lagos State Government, Adebayo also advised the CBN and the Bankers’ Committee to activate the ‘sustainability road map’ through the proactive engagement of professional facility management process as they commenced the revamping of the national monument. According to him, one of the challenges with the effective operation of National Theatre was lack of professional management of the facility. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
