John Alechenu, Abuja THE Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, has said Edo State will return to the All Progressives Congress by the time the governorship election is held on September 10. He described the election as a must-win for the APC, which currently does not have a single governor in the entire South-South geopolitical zone. Sylva spoke with newsmen shortly after the inaugural meeting of the Contact and Mobilisation Committee of the APC National Campaign Council for the Edo State Governorship Election, at the APC National Secretariat, Abuja, on Tuesday. He said, “A few months ago, as you are all aware, they took Bayelsa State from us through the back door after we won the election, and now through the back door again, they have taken Edo State. “But luckily we have the opportunity of reclaiming Edo State in a few weeks from now and every South-South APC member is of the consensus that we must reclaim Edo.” Copyright PUNCH.
