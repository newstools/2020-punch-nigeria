John Alechenu and Godwin Isenyo The highly influential nephew of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Mamman Daura, has suggested that the most qualified Nigerian irrespective of zone should succeed his uncle in 2023. Daura made the suggestion in a rare interview he granted the Hausa Service of the BBC, which was monitored in Abuja, on Tuesday. According to him, since Nigerians have thrice tried rotational presidency, it would be better to go for the most qualified candidate in 2023 irrespective of whether he comes from the North or the South. This, he said, would be better for the nation’s unity. When asked about his relationship with Buhari, he said, “He is my uncle; he is my father’s younger brother. My father is the first born of their mother and General Buhari is the last.” In response to another question about he and the President spending their youthful years together, he said, “It is true we were together.” Asked if he visits the President to greet and offer advice now that Buhari is in power, he said, “Yes, I usually go and visit and offer advice. If he asks me, I offer advice, but I don’t just go and tell him what to do; you don’t do that with the government.” On issues relating to the 2023 presidential election, Daura said, “Rotation has been done once, twice and three times; it is important that this nation is united as one; the most qualified/competent should be elected and not someone who comes from a particular zone.” Copyright PUNCH.
