John Alechenu and Godwin Isenyo The highly influential nephew of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Mamman Daura, has suggested that the most qualified Nigerian irrespective of zone should succeed his uncle in 2023. Daura made the suggestion in a rare interview he granted the Hausa Service of the BBC, which was monitored in Abuja, on Tuesday. According to him, since Nigerians have thrice tried rotational presidency, it would be better to go for the most qualified candidate in 2023 irrespective of whether he comes from the North or the South. This, he said, would be better for the nation’s unity. When asked about his relationship with Buhari, he said, “He is my uncle; he is my father’s younger brother. My father is the first born of their mother and General Buhari is the last.” In response to another question about he and the President spending their youthful years together, he said, “It is true we were together.” Asked if he visits the President to greet and offer advice now that Buhari is in power, he said, “Yes, I usually go and visit and offer advice. If he asks me, I offer advice, but I don’t just go and tell him what to do; you don’t do that with the government.” On issues relating to the 2023 presidential election, Daura said, “Rotation has been done once, twice and three times; it is important that this nation is united as one; the most qualified/competent should be elected and not someone who comes from a particular zone.” Reacting to Daura’s suggestions, elder statesman, Dr. Junaid Mohammed in a telephone interview with The PUNCH agreed with Daura. He said, “If you are talking about democracy you must allow free choice. Competence, integrity and truthfulness must be the kind of qualities to look for in a leader. “I hope those who have now seen the light are sincere. We have to accept that zoning and rotation which we have practised for over two decades has not worked. The ultimate test of any process is if it has delivered. “You don’t choose people to lead on the basis of returning a favour. All the leaders we have produced based on this faulty premise of rotation have not delivered why should we continue with it?” The Director-General of the Voice of Nigeria who is also a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Enugu State, Osita Okechukwu, is however of the view that the emergence of a President of Igbo extraction was required to strengthen Nigeria’s bond of unity. He said, “My views on this issue are known, the clamour for a president of Igbo extraction is to strengthen the bond of our nationhood.

He, however, said “Nigeria, was not yet politically mature enough at this time to jettison zoning and rotation because other component parts of the country whose turn it is to produce president in 2023 will consider such actions as an affront on their political sensibilities. Okunniyi also cautioned that, “Any attempt by Daura and co to foist this agenda on the country may backfire as it’s likely to throw the country into political division, civil strife and political instability. “ Copyright PUNCH.
