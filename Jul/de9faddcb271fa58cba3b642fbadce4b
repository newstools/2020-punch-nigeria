Gbenga Adeniji The Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress on Saturday reacted to the rumour making the rounds that it endorsed a former commissioner in the state to contest the Lagos-East senatorial district bye-election. The position became vacant following the death of Senator Bayo Osinowo aka Pepperito who died on June 15, 2020. There have been several permutations regarding persons the party would give the ticket to fly its flag during the election. The party in a statement on Saturday by its spokesperson, Mr Seye Oladejo, forwarded to our correspondent by the APC Secretary, Lanre Ogunyemi, described the development as speculation. It said, “Our attention has been drawn to the various speculations as regards the emergence of a candidate for the yet-to-be scheduled Lagos-East senatorial by-election. Lagos State APC will like to state emphatically that the process of selecting a candidate has yet to commence for a number of reasons. “First, our party is still mourning the demise of Senator Sikiru Adebayo Osinowo whose sudden departure sent shock waves through the fabrics of the party. The Independent National Electoral Commission has yet to officially notify the party of the scheduled by-election.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
