Dayo Ojerinde The Managing Director, Clina Lancet Laboratories, to Dr. Olayemi Dawodu, has reiterated the commitment of the laboratory to fight COVID-19. Recall that the laboratory was one of the seven private laboratories approved by the Lagos State Government to conduct COVID-19 test in the state. Dawodu, in a statement on Tuesday, said the laboratory was selected and approved by the Lagos State Ministry of Health to carry out the COVID-19 test after a rigorous accreditation and validation process by the Health Facility Monitoring and Accreditation Agency. “We are happy to be partnering the government in the fight against COVID-19. This partnership will enable a larger number of people to have access to the COVID-19 test thereby increasing our testing capacity as a country and bringing us closer to fighting the global pandemic. ‘In addition to increasing Nigeria’s capacity for testing, this partnership and accreditation is in line with our vision to be the undisputed market leader that provides an extensive range of specialised and advanced tests to support the fight against key health issues such as the COVID -19 affecting our continent. Our test results are guaranteed between 24 and 48 hours after sample collection,” he said. Dawodu added that patients could book for COVID-19 test on the laboratory’s website, walk into their tests centres or could call to have their tests done for them at home. Copyright PUNCH.
