Ada Wodu, Calabar Four suspected kidnappers have been paraded by the police in Calabar, Cross River State, after a 38-year-old victim, Cecilia Onyago, was rescued. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, paraded the suspects at the Police Command Headquarters, Diamond Hill, Calabar, on Monday. The suspects are Eyo Nsa, aka Eteobong; Okon Asuqwuo, aka Okikpo; Ernest Akpan; and Paulinus Ogar. According to the police spokesperson, no ransom was collected for the victim’s release. She explained that the woman and her husband were going about their normal business when the armed kidnappers attacked them and took Onyago on July 10, 2020, in the Akamkpa Local Government Area of the state. “The police got distress calls from people and we swung into action. In a bid to know the location where the woman was taken to, we arrested one of the suspects, who led us to other members of the gang. “A lot of items were recovered from them, including two vehicles — a Toyota Camry with number plate, NEM 828 AY, and a Volkswagen Jetta, with the number plate, LSD 879 AV — and several locally-made guns,” she added. Ugbo said the suspects had given the police useful information, adding that they would be charged to court at the conclusion of investigation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
