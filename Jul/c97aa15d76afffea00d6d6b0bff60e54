Deji Lambo Men of the Lagos State Police Command have arrested two ex-convicts for alleged traffic robbery in the state. PUNCH Metro gathered that the men, Tunde Olaiya and Tokunbo Omotola, allegedly attacked and robbed unsuspecting members of the public of their valuables during separate operations in the Ojodu-Berger and Oshodi areas of the state. The duo were said to be returning to Oshodi to sell the stolen property, including an iPhone X, to buyers, when personnel of the Rapid Response Squad intercepted them. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, said in a statement that the suspects, during interrogation, could not explain where they got the phone, adding that other items recovered from them included a powdery substance used in breaking the glass of vehicles stuck in gridlock. The police spokesman said the man whose phone was retrieved from Olaiya described his experience in the hands of the suspects as traumatic, adding that the command had returned his phone. “Both suspects confessed that once phones are collected, they remove the SIMs and sell them at N2,000 each. “The Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has reaffirmed his commitment towards ridding the state of criminals. The suspects will be charged to court,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
