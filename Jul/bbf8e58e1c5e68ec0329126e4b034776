Toni Ufoh Former Super Eagles midfielder, Etim Esin, has advised Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo to come out of international retirement. The former Watford striker, 31, announced his retirement from the national team last July, after helping the Eagles clinch bronze at the 2019 African Cup of Nations in Egypt, where he finished as tournament’s top scorer with five goals. Ighalo, who joined the Red Devils in January, has been impressive for the club, scoring five goals in 11 appearances in all competitions. Etim said Ighalo’s inclusion in the Eagles would impact on the younger players in the team, adding that it would help build their confidence. “I think this is a job for the coach (Gernot Rohr), he’s the one in charge and he should try and convince Ighalo to rescind his decision on retirement from the national team,” Esin told The PUNCH on Wednesday. “Ighalo’s return to the Eagles will help to boost the confidence level of younger strikers in the team and this will help us going forward. “Samuel Chukwueze, Victor Osimhen and others would benefit from his experience if the coach brings him back. “We should learn to tap from the resources we have in our hands. Ighalo is one of the best strikers we have today, Rohr should convince him to return.” The ex-Flying Eagles star added, “How can Nigeria have a player in Manchester United and he is not in the national team? Playing in an elite team like Manchester United alone is an experience on its own. “Do we want to waste all that? It is wrong. He needs to share his experience with young strikers in the team. That is how a team grows. This is where the coach needs to come all out and encourage him to help the team with his experience.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
