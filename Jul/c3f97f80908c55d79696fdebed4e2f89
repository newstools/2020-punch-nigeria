Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The combined patrol teams of the state vigilance service and the police have foiled another kidnapping attempt on the Lokoja-Okene  highway. It was gathered that four of the kidnapping suspects met their Waterloo when they tried to kidnap travellers around 6.30pm on Sunday. The Lokoja Okene, Abuja highway have been a hotbed of kidnappings in the last two weeks. This has prompted the state security adviser, Navy Commander Jerry Omodara, to deploy men of the state vigilante services in the area. The efforts paid off on Sunday when the four suspects were reportedly killed. The state police command spokesman, DSP William Aya, said he would get back to our correspondent. Omodara, however, said the success recorded was a result of renewed onslaught ordered by the state Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello. He said the onslaught was intensified on Friday following a tip-off leading to “hot chase of the kidnappers deep into the bush where four were shot and one Ak 47-rifle  was recovered.” Copyright PUNCH.
