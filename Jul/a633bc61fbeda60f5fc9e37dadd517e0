JOHN CHARLES THE Benue State Livestock Guards has impounded 92 cows for contravening the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law of the state. The Commander of the Livestock Guards, Mr Linus Zaki, told journalists that 60 cows were impounded in Ohimini and 30 in the Logo Local Government Areas of the State. He said that owners of the affected livestock must pay the stipulated fines to get back their cattle. Zaki emphasised the commitment of the guards to the enforcement of the legislation, saying that animals being kept in ranches were also enjoying the legal protection provided by the law. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Security Matters, Col. Paul Hembah (retd.),  expressed the commitment of Governor Samuel Ortom to the rule of law and the safety of Benue people. He decried a situation where cattle owners abandoned herders arrested by the state livestock guards to their fate and engaged new herders to look after their animals. Copyright PUNCH.
