John Alechenu, Abuja A former acting National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Hilliard Eta, has urged party members with litigation against the party to withdraw such matters as part of sacrifices required for reconciliation. Eta, who also served as the National Vice Chairman (South South) in the Adams Oshiomhole-led APC National Working Committee, which was dissolved by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), said this while addressing journalists in Abuja on Thursday. He said, “I appeal to our party members to also embark on this cause of action out of respect for the directive issued by the President and our party’s National Executive Committee. It is the right thing to do in order for us to quickly rebuild our party for optimum performance.” Buhari had at the last NEC meeting in June directed that all pending court cases filed by party members against the party and its officers be withdrawn. He warned that dire consequences awaited those who would flout the directive. Eta spoke against the backdrop of his recent victory at the Federal High Court, Calabar. Copyright PUNCH.
