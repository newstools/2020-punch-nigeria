Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo THE Taraba State Commissioner for Health, Dr Innocent Vakkai, has said the state Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Rev. Peter Gambo, did not die of COVID-19, but complications from diabetes. Vakkai said the late labour leader had COVID-19 test before he died, adding that the result came back negative. “He was suspected of  having COVID-19, but his result came back negative. Gambo was being treated for diabetes and his sugar level became high, leading to his death,” he stressed. Meanwhile, the Taraba State governor, Darius Ishaku, has expressed shock over the death of Gambo. Ishaku described Gambo’s death as devastating to his administration. In a statement signed by the governor’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Bala Dan-Abu, Ishaku said Gambo played a vital role in making labour in Taraba State a strategic partner of government in the development of the state.
