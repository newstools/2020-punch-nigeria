Kelvin Ekerete Former Newcastle and Olympique Marseille defender, Habib Beye, believes ex-Super Eagles captain, Austin Okocha, could have won the Ballon d’Or with the talent he had. The French-born Beye was an academy player at Paris Saint-Germain when the Nigerian, alongside Barcelona legend Ronaldinho, played at the club before the Eagles legend made a move to the Premier League. While Ronaldinho went on to become a successful player with Barcelona, where he won the UEFA Champions League and was crowned World Footballer of The Year twice, Okocha joined modest Bolton Wanderers, where he also became a cult figure hero. “Okocha is one of the great players who could not play in big clubs. Ronaldinho could have had two to four gold balloons. Jay Jay Okocha is such a talent and could have been too,” Beye told Canal plus. Okocha despite his talent was not on the books of some of the biggest clubs in Europe. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
