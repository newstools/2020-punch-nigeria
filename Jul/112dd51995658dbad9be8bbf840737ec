Norwich had two players sent off in an extraordinary first half as they lost to Burnley on another night to forget for the relegated side. Emiliano Buendia was shown a straight red for violent conduct on Ashley Westwood after referee Kevin Friend watched a replay in the referee review area. Nine minutes later, Josip Drmic’s high-studded tackle on Erik Pieters received the same punishment, before Chris Wood’s scuffed overhead kick put Burnley in front on the stroke of half-time. It had been an uneventful opening half an hour before Norwich’s capitulation, with just one shot on target from either side. The hosts defended well at times in the second half to keep the score down but Burnley’s victory was confirmed when Ben Godfrey poked the ball into the back of his own net with 10 minutes remaining. Norwich become only the third club in the Premier League to lose five in a row at home without scoring, while Burnley move above Arsenal into ninth place. For Norwich, the season could get worse still when they travel to Etihad Stadium to face Manchester City in their final game.
