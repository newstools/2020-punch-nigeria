Johnny Edward Former Chairman of the League Management Company Nduka Irabor says the LMC lacks the “modern sophisticated production capacity” to televise matches of the Nigeria Professional Football League. According to Irabor, Nigeria’s over-reliance on foreign production companies for television coverage of NPFL matches has left the LMC “stranded” and without any alternative. “These last few years we’ve been depending on foreign production companies, they’ve withdrawn now and we are stranded,” Irabor was quoted as saying in an interview with busybuddiesng.com. “I think there’s an urgent need to increase or introduce a more modern sophisticated production capacity. “The LMC is exploiting ways to bring this about so that we have products that we can put online, we have products that we can dice and cut in a manner the digital space is filled with sporting activities. “We are trying to build a production company, financing is going to determine how fast we move but we are seriously working on having our own independent production company. “First of all, we need to address the rather weak infrastructure particularly in terms of the digital platform. “We can do better than this, the penetration is there but it could be deeper and the stability and latency of the internet we have is not the best. “So, let’s improve the digital penetration – the backbone – that the Nigerian Communication Commission has been preaching a long time. Once we do that, then you can find streaming production products on the internet. “But then to stream, you have to produce. I do know for football and most other sports we lack production capacity. So, it’s time to invest in production capacity to have our own means.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
