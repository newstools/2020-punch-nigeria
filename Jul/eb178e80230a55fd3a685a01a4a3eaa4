Ted Odogwu, Kano The Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje on Wednesday said his administration had embarked on conversion of abandoned public structures in the state into purposeful infrastructure. He said, “Instead of allowing economically viable structures to lie fallow, we are considering proposals on how to translate the projects that will change the physical landscape of Kano, as well as become revenue earners for the state.” Apparently responding to allegations by critics that his administration was selling public properties, Ganduje said government needed to be innovative in ensuring that abandoned structures were converted into edifices that “will ensure the sustainability of Kano City.” “Therefore, critics will not derail us from our goal,” he added. Ganduje spoke at the sState executive council meeting, shortly after the presentations of two companies willing to work with the state government to transform two abandoned public structures on build-operate-transfer basis. The first proposal was from FARI Properties Limited, intending to transform the abandoned Daula Hotel in the state capital into a residential complex, while the other had proposal was from LAMASH Properties Limited, which signified intention to remodel the old Triumph Publishing Company to a Modern Forex Market. Ganduje said, “The state Executive Council is to consider proposals on how to make best use of the abandoned public properties and make due consultations before taking at decision that would be in the best public interest.” Copyright PUNCH.
