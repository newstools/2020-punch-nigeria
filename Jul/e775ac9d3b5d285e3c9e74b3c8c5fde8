Kelvin Ekerete Jorge Masvidal has apologised to his fans after his welterweight title loss to Kamaru Usman on Sunday in UFC 251 in Abu Dhabi. Masvidal lost 50-45, 50-45, 49-46 on the three judges card, the 14th loss of his career and his fifth in his last 11 fights. The “Gamebred”, after the loss, took to Twitter to apologise to his fans, promising he’ll bounce back in his next fight. “Sorry I couldn’t bring it home this time. Next time #theresurrection,” Masvidal replied US senator Marco Rubio, who had earlier tweeted in support of the 35-year-old, “Let’s goooo @GamebredFighter representing the #305 in #UFC251.” Champion, Kamaru Usman, has also given the Miami-born Mixed Martial Arts star credit for being a worthy contender. “Jorge is a tough guy and I give him credit for that,” said Usman. “They call him ‘Gamebred’ for a reason – he’s always game to fight. “I’m just a level better. I have more tools in the toolbox.” Mashvisal, who had six days to prepare for the fight after replacing Gilbert Burns, had told Usman he would be interested in a rematch after getting more wins, to put him in contention for the title. “I’ll get a couple wins and we’ll run it back,” Masvidal said after the bout.
