Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The wife of the Imo State Governor, Chioma Uzodinma, and the senator representing Anambra Central in the Senate, Uche Ekwunife, have rescued a 20-year-old woman, Nkechi Ezenwa, who was delivered of a set of triplets prematurely. Ezenwa was allegedly raped while hawking bananas in Owerri and became pregnant as a result. The lady, who was delivered of two of the triplets through caesarean section at the Paveliar Care Clinic in Ubomiri, after she had earlier given birth on her own to the first baby at a health centre, was being held at the hospital because of the outstanding bill. Ekwunife, on Saturday, made a donation of N500,000 for the upkeep of the triplets. The senator, who was represented by Ify Chinwuko, during a visit to the triplets at the hospital, said she was touched by their story. According to the lawmaker, the triplets and their mother deserve to live. Also, the wife of the governor evacuated the triplets and their mother to the Federal Medical Centre, Owerri, for proper care. Chioma, who visited the children at the hospital on Saturday, said the state government would assume responsibility for their welfare. The governor’s wife, who was represented by the state Commissioner for Gender and Vulnerable Groups, Nkechi Ugwu, said the state government would rehabilitate the mother as well. Our correspondent was told by medical personnel at the FMC, Owerri, that the triplets were under incubation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
