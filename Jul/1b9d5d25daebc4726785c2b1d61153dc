Ted Odogwu, Kano The Kano State House of Assembly, on Wednesday, commenced the process to further amend the State’s Penal Code amendment (No.12), the law of 2014, so as to provide for castration, as penalty for rape offenders in the state. The Assembly made the proposal, following a motion presented on Wednesday by a member, Nuraddeen Al-hassan, representing Rano Local Government Area seeking for the review of the law. During the plenary session presided over by the Speaker, Abdulazeez Gafasa, the majority of the Assembly members were unanimous in the decision. While calling for the review of the law to further reflect a harsher punishment for rapists in the state, Al-hassan emphasised that the current 14 years jail-term punishment for offenders is not enough. To this extent, he, therefore, called on the House to recall the law and amend it so as to provide castration punishment for rapists. “I believe this is the only measure to be taken to end the rampant cases of rape in our society as it is so worrisome. “I also want to appeal to the House to look into the security challenges so as to strengthen their efforts in tackling the rape cases in the state,” he said.
