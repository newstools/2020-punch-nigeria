Peter David, Benin City The Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party on Monday taken a swipe at the former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, saying he was a deceitful leader. Referring to Governor Godwin Obaseki while addressing the APC supporters in Benin on Sunday, Oshiomhole said he sold a bad product to the people of Edo State in the 2016 election. But at a press briefing on Monday, the state Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr Chris Nehikhare, said Oshiomhole could not continue to hoodwink the electorate, adding that the people were wiser. Nehikhare, who described Oshiomhole as a man full of deceit, said the former national chairman had again come out to beg Edo people for forgiveness, which was another ploy to deceive them. He said, “We also noticed yesterday (Sunday) that the former chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, while apologising to Edo people, knelt for forgiveness. We are not amused and we find it ridiculous that a man who stood on a podium four years ago to condemn his candidate for the September 19 governorship election in Edo State has resurfaced singing his praises.

Edo people should ask; can this man be trusted?  Edo people should not take him seriously. In 2008, he talked about ending godfatherism but we all know it was a ruse; as his present-day actions do not suggest what he said then and shouldn’t be taken seriously.” Copyright PUNCH.
