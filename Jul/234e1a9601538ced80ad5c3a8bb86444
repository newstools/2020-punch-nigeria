Patrick Odey, Uyo Some elders, under the auspices of the Akwa Ibom Leaders’ Vanguard, have thrown their weight behind the clamour for an Igbo President in 2023. The coordinator of the group, Senator Anietie Okon, said the support for the Igbo cause was in pursuit of equity, political inclusiveness, peace and development that had since eluded Nigeria. Okon, who spoke with journalists in Uyo, also reiterated the call for restructuring, which he said would allow states or zones to manage their resources and pay royalties to the centre. He said the presidency should be zoned to the South in 2023, adding, “When it is zoned to the South, then it will be fair to micro-zone it to the South-East geo-political block, which rightly deserves that next slot.” On restructuring, he said, “The current structure is an aberration in which resources from one region are taken to develop other zones and fund their development agencies such as the North East Development Commission.” Copyright PUNCH.
