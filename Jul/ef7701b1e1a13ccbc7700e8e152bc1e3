Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who gained national recognition for her handling of turbulent anti-racism protests, tested positive Monday for coronavirus. “COVID-19 has literally hit home. I have had NO symptoms and have tested positive,” Bottoms tweeted. In an interview with CNN, she explained that she and her husband, who also tested positive, had decided to get tested because he had been sleeping more than normal since Thursday. “I’m still in a state of shock because I don’t have any idea how we were exposed,” Bottoms said. She also experienced light symptoms — a mild headache and dry cough — but attributed them to allergies.

She has since been mentioned as a potential running mate for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The US is the world’s hardest-hit country, both in confirmed cases and deaths. It has reported almost 3 million COVID-19 cases over 130,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
