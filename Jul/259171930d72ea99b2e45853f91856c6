Leke Baiyewu, Abuja A bill seeking to bar National Commissioners and Resident Electoral Commissioners of the Independent National Electoral Commission from seeking elective offices within five years after retirement or resignation passed second reading in the House of Representatives on Tuesday. If the bill scales through the legislative process and is assented to by the President, such persons would be barred from seeking elective public offices within five years after their disengagement. This proposal is contained in a bill seeking to amend the Electoral Act 2019, which the lawmaker representing Epe Federal Constituency of Lagos State, Mr Olawale Raji, sponsored. The piece of legislation is titled ‘A Bill for an Act to Amend the Electoral Act to Prohibit Electoral Officers from Engaging in Partisan Politics within Five Years of Retirement, Resignation and Official Relief of Duties’. Raji said, “The bill seeks to amend the Electoral Act to prohibit electoral officers from engaging in partisan politics within five years of retirement, resignation and official relief of duties and other related matters.” The REC in charge of Cross River State, Dr Frankland Briyai, had on August 8, 2019, resigned his appointment to enable him to contest the governorship race in Bayelsa State.
