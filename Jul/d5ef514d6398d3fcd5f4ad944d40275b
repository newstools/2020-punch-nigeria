Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Two women, on Monday, appeared before an Osun State Chief Magistrates’ Court sitting in Osogbo for using abusive words on some police officers while performing their lawful duties. The defendants, Rufiat Saliu, 22, and Tosin Babatunde, 50, were also accused of assault and breach of the public peace. The prosecutor, Femi Adebayo, explained that the defendants committed the offence on July 11, 2020, at the Omiasoro Breweries area of Ilesha. Adebayo said the defendants used abuse words on the police officers and other security men at their duty post and by their conduct, made a crowd to gather around the victims. He said the defendants, who disregarded the COVID-19 lockdown order of the Osun State Government, also assaulted one Sergeant Akinro and hit Latiran Olaosebikan with a stick, thereby inflicting an open wound on his head. The offences were said to be contrary to the Osun Infectious Diseases Emergency Prevention Regulation, 2020, and punishable under ‘sections 61, 516, 356, 355 and 249(d) of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Vol. II, Laws of Osun State of Nigeria, 2020.’ The defendants pleaded not guilty to the five counts bordering on breach of the peace, assault and conspiracy pressed against them. Their counsel, Mr Kehinde Adepoju, urged the court to admit the defendants to bail. The presiding Magistrate, Mrs Modupe Awodele, admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N100,000 with two sureties each in like sum. She adjourned the matter till July 20, 2020. Copyright PUNCH.
