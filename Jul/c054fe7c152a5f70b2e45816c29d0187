Ife Ogunfuwa PricewaterhouseCoopers says that a properly implemented African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement will liberate Nigeria and other African countries from foreign aid and donor funds. The consulting firm, in a report entitled ‘COVID-19 and the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement’ said that the Intra-African market could help to mitigate some of the negative effects of COVID-19. This, according to the report published on Friday, will limit the continent’s dependence on external partners, particularly in food and pharmaceutical industry. Analysts at PwC led by Fiscal Policy Partner and West Africa Tax leader at PwC, Taiwo Oyedele, said this could be achieved by developing the regional value chain, supply chain and logistics within the continent. PwC said, “A well-executed AfCFTA will go a long way in reducing Africa’s reliance on donor funds and external aid in a global or continental recession. Through the AfCFTA, Africa has an opportunity to reconfigure its supply chain, to reduce its dependence on external partners and to speed up the establishment of regional value chains that will boost intra-African trade.” The analysts also highlighted the importance of a digital economic strategy for the sustenance and development of the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. They noted that Egypt, with three active digital strategies on e-commerce, social responsibility in ICT, and Arabic content, would have an edge over countries with weak or no digital framework to support trade in goods and services.
