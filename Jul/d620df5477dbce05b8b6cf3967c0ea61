Joseph Olaoluwa Airline operators have been directed to contact the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority on the status of any airport before selling tickets to passengers. The Director-General of the NCAA, Capt. Musa Nuhu, gave the directive during a webinar that held on Tuesday night. Nuhu said a few operators had gone ahead to advertise flights to airports that were yet to be approved for operations. He said, “I just want the operators to please contact FAAN to confirm which airports are open for normal operations before they start selling tickets to the travelling public. “I have seen some airlines advertising tickets when those airports have not been certified open. Please let’s proceed with caution. It is a matter of consumer protection and we should not misinform the public.” Meanwhile, a total of eight airlines have got the NCAA’s approval to restart operations. Chairman, NCAA COVID-19 Committee, Godwin Balang, gave the feedback at the webinar. He listed the airlines that had secured approval to resume operations as Aero Contractors, Air Peace, Arik Air, Azman Air, Dana Airlines, Ibom Air, Max Air and Overland Airways Limited.
