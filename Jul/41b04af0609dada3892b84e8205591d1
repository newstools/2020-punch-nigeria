Johnny Edward Victor Osimhen has reportedly decided not to train with Lille until he has taken a decision on his future, thus fueling rumours of a move to Italian giants Napoli on Thursday (today), The PUNCH reports. Our correspondent learnt that the Nigerian was unhappy with the development surrounding his exit from Lille, having previously made it known this summer, that he wanted a new challenge. “Osimhen has not trained since he arrived in France after his father’s burial because there’s an ongoing negotiation with Napoli over a summer transfer move but nothing has changed,” Osita Okolo, the striker’s brother-in-law and agent, said. “But both clubs (Lille and Napoli) are back on the negotiation table, so there is hope for a way out in the coming hours.” The PUNCH also gathered that Osimhen had parted ways with his old agents Jean-Gerard Benoit Czajka and Didier Frenay and had gotten himself a new agent under the direction of Lille president Gerard Lopez. His new agent, William D’avilla, who currently manages other Nigerian stars Emmanuel Dennis, Moses Simon, Samuel Kalu among others, was recommended by Lopez. D’avilla was involved in Osimhen’s transfer from Sporting Charleroi to Lille last summer. Osimhen, who scored 18 goals in 38 matches for Lille last season, is currently valued at €81m by Lille.
