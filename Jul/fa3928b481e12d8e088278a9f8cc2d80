Raphael Ede, Enugu The South-East Governors Forum and leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, have resolved to jointly tackle the current infrastructural deficit in the zone. They lamented that the Federal Government abandoned the zone since the Nigerian civil war in 1970. President General of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo was quoted as saying this during the inauguration of 54-member Steering Committee for the Alaigbo Stabilisation Fund in Enugu, on Wednesday. This was contained in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Chief Emeka Attamah. The statement said the committee arrived at the decision during a virtual meeting with the members. It quoted Nwodo as saying, “The fund is in-order to build a home land that is industrialised with modern world-class physical and social infrastructure, competitive, attractive for investments and generates employment for the teaming youthful population.” Chairman of the Steering Committee for the Fund, Prof Ogbu, who spoke on behalf of other members commended the selfless service, visionary leadership and clarity of expression of Chief Nwodo.
