Okechukwu Nnodim The President Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers, Emmanuel Wike, on Friday kicked against the decision of the Federal Inland Revenue Service to impose six per cent stamp duty on all tenancy and lease agreements. He condemned the new FIRS policy while speaking on the sidelines of an inspection tour of the institution’s headquarter building in Abuja. On Thursday, the FIRS charged all landlords and property agents to ensure that they collect and remit to the service six per cent as stamp duty on all tenancy and lease agreements. It said landlords and property agents should make the remittance in order not run foul of the Stamp Duty Act. But reacting to this on Friday in Abuja, Wike argued that the policy was going to be a very big burden on the Nigerian masses who were mostly tenants. He said, “It is going to impact on the industry. Although I wouldn’t want to give a personal opinion as the institution is looking at that. “We have a Presidential Advisory Committee that we just formed and we have handed the matter to them. We have a legal committee that is looking at it also. “However, as a person, I can tell you that that is a very big burden for members of the society that are not property owners, especially those who are tenants.” Wike told journalists that the institution would definitely come up with its position on the matter. He said the position of NIESV would be sent to the FIRS once the institution completes its recommendations on the matter. On the building project, Wike expressed satisfaction with the level of work at the site and expressed hopes that the building would be in use before 2022. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
