Umar Muhammed, Lafia The Federal Government has said that no fewer than 50,000 smallholder farmers will benefit from the OCP Africa post-COVID-19 intervention package across the country. The Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Mustapha Shehuri, stated this on Tuesday at Karshi Market, Abuja, while inaugurating the OCP Africa post-COVID-19 intervention package for farmers in the country. The minister explained that it was critical to put food security measures in place, given the prediction that hunger might be a fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shehuri said, “No fewer than 50,000 smallholder farmers are to benefit from the OCP Africa post-COVID-19 intervention package across the country. “The OCP, one of the leading companies in the global production and exportation of phosphate-based fertilizers, is working within the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative of the Federal Government of Nigeria, and with blending plants under the Fertilizer Producers and Suppliers of Nigeria, to contribute to the PFI objectives of providing access to locally-produced NPK 20:10:10 fertilizer for smallholder farmers.” Copyright PUNCH.
