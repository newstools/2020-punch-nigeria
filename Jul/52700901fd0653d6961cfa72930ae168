Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa THE Ijaw Youth Council has written to the Independent National Electoral Commission, demanding that a date be fixed for the bye-elections to fill the vacant seats of Bayelsa Central and Bayelsa East senatorial districts. The two seats became vacant following the inauguration of the former occupants, Douye Diri (Bayelsa Central) and Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo (Bayelsa East), as governor and deputy governor of the state, respectively, on February 14. In the letter signed by the Chairman, IYC, Western Zone, Kennedy Olorogun, the Ijaw youths expressed worry that the six-month long delay was shortchanging the two senatorial districts in the National Assembly. The letter, which was copied the state Resident Electoral Commissioner, was addressed to the INEC National Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu. Olorogun said the people of the districts were becoming restive and perturbed by the “unpleasant development.” The letter read in part, “We write to express the fears and predicament of our people to you and to draw your attention to the lack of representation of the people of the Bayelsa West and Bayelsa Central senatorial districts at the National Assembly.” Copyright PUNCH.
