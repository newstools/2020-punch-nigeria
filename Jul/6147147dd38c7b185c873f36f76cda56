Peter David, Benin City Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, on Tuesday, accused the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, of sponsoring protests over an alleged N20bn loan to be taken by the state government from the Nigeria Stock Exchange. Obaseki, who is the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the September 19 governorship election, advised Ize-Iyamu to go to court and face his corruption trial instead of sponsoring protests over non-existent issues. A group, Joint Forces for the Defence of Democracy, on Tuesday, rejected the alleged move by Edo State Government to borrow N20bn from the Stock Exchange. Leaders of the group, Felix Isere and Marxist Kola Edokpayi, in a protest rally round major streets in Benin, said the state government had no justification to acquire the loan. Responding to allegations made by the group, Special Adviser to Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie, said, “In a bid to distract Edo people from his ongoing trial in court for a N700m fraud allegation, the candidate of the APC has resorted to sponsoring protests over non-existent issues. “There is no such thing as the N20bn debt proposal by the Edo State Government, and Edo people cannot be distracted by such wild claim.” But the Chairman of Edo State APC Media Campaign Council, John Mayaki, while responding to Osagie, said, “It is ludicrous and insulting to the people of Edo State for Crusoe Osagie to suggest that the anger they expressed today on the streets of Benin over the N20bn loan Obaseki is trying to obtain for his collapsing campaign was done at the behest of Osagie Ize-Iyamu.” Copyright PUNCH.
