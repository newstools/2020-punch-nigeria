Kelvin Ekerete A section of sports enthusiasts have called on the government to extend the lockdown on sporting facilities across the country due to the rise in COVID-19 cases. The Federal Government recently relaxed restrictions on worship centres, while primary and secondary schools graduating pupils were given the go-ahead to return to school. Blessed Onaemor, a businessman, believes the government should only allow sectors that contribute to its Gross Domestic Product to resume normal activities. “I quite agree with the lid still placed on sporting facilities because the reality for us as a country is that sports is not a money-spinning venture yet. It is just for recreation. We can’t compare ourselves with Europe and America in terms of the value sports bring to the economy,” Onaemor stated. “Opening of sporting facilities now is a matter of misplaced priority. As much as I love sports, it should be one of the last sectors of the economy to be reopened,” Godstime Amenaghawon, a studentt, added. Biola Ajayi, a banker, stated, “Those clamouring for sports to return are majorly football lovers and league players. CAF has released a medical guideline on how football should resume and we are yet to meet that. CAF has made things easier by postponing the AFCON. The government should take its time before opening its gates to sports lovers. For now, we should enjoy other sporting events across Europe.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
