Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Oyo State Command, said it had arrested eight hoodlums, who allegedly specialised in snatching motorcycles in Ibadan. The suspects are Mustapha Suleiman, 35; Sanni Ataka, 37; Sarafadeen Amodu, 29; Muktaka Gambo, 17; Abubakar Ibraheem, 27; Haruna Adamu, 28; Ado Adamu, 29; and Lamidi Saidu, 28. It was gathered that one of the suspects asked a commercial motorcyclist, Adeyi Olalekan, 25, who resides in the Awososo area, Bembo Apata, Ibadan, to convey him and one other person to Iyana Celestial, NNPC area, Apata, around 6.30pm on Sunday. The motorcyclist was overpowered by other members of the gang and was attacked with a locally-fabricated gun and knife, while his motorcycle was snatched. In an attempt to escape from the scene, one of the hoodlums fell off the motorcycle and tried to bolt away, but he was arrested at the Johnson Awe area of Apata by men of the NSCDC. The state Commandant of the NSCDC, Mr Iskilu Akinsanya, while parading the suspects on Monday, said other members of the gang were later apprehended by the Intelligence and Investigation Department of the corps. “The suspects were arrested with one locally-made gun, six mobile telephone sets, one NIMC identity card, three red Boxer motorcycles with the number plates, Osun BDS 725 QR, Oyo MNY 929 QM and Ogun JGB 136 WF,” he stated. Akinsanya commended the people of the area for providing intelligence report that led to the arrest of the suspects. “We are seizing this opportunity to call for more support from the people of Oyo State in a bid to get rid of criminal elements in our communities,” he added.
