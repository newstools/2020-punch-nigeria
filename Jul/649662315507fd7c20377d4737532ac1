Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja A former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has again dumped the opposition Peoples Democratic Party for the ruling All Progressives Congress. Announcing the development to State House correspondents on Friday, the Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Committee, Mai Mala Buni, said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), was happy seeing Dogara return to the party. Dogara, alongside a former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, and some governors had left the APC for the PDP ahead of the 2019 general elections. But Buni led him to a meeting with Buhari on Friday to announce his return to the President. Dogara, who is still a member of the House of Representatives, however, refused to speak with State House correspondents. Buni told reporters that they were at the Presidential Villa for a courtesy visit to the President in continuation of their efforts to rebuild the party and to brief him on the developments in the party. When reporters talked about people expressing surprise that Dogara accompanied him to meet with the President, Buni said, “They shouldn’t be surprised because the former Speaker is a member of the APC and it is because the reason why he left the APC is no more there.” When asked to be specific if Dogara had returned to the party, replied, “Yes, he’s back.” The Yobe State governor further revealed that Buhari was happy with the development. “He (the President) welcomed him. He is happy with the development. That is what he’s looking for. “We are rebuilding the party and these are the steps we are taking towards rebuilding the party.” Copyright PUNCH.
