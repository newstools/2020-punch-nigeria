As the drive to reach 80 per cent financial inclusion target by 2020 given by the Central Bank of Nigeria intensifies, more PoS terminals are being issued for super agents to extend the reach of financial services to remote areas where banking services are not available. Speaking at a virtual event recently, the Head, Digital Financial Services, CBN, Stephen Ambore, stated that recent figures showed that 36.6 million Nigerians were excluded from access to financial services, including pension and insurance. According to him, the industry started from 58 per cent financial inclusion in 2012 and is targeting 80 per cent inclusion by the end of 2020. He said, “What that means is that we want to improve the penetration of payments by 70 per cent this year. Improve credits to 60 per cent, improve insurance by 40 per cent this year.” According to Ambore, the CBN revised the national financial inclusion strategy and provided a level playing field for the provision of financial services in order to attain 80 per cent financial inclusion by the end of the year. He said through the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities initiative, the apex bank was looking to expanding the digital payments access points from zero to 500,000 by the end of this year.
