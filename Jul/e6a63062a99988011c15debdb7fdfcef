Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The management of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria on Wednesday said it strongly condemned the conduct of a former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, at the Kano airport on Saturday. In series of tweets via its official Twitter handle, FAAN said Yari blatantly violated the public health procedures against COVID-19 on travels at the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport on Saturday. The airports authority said, “He (Yari) refused to adhere to the protocols and procedures put in place by the Federal Government through the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 by forcefully pushing away an officer of the Environment Department when he insisted that his luggage must be disinfected. “The former governor said the officer should have known he is a VIP. This irresponsible act endangers all other airport users; it is unacceptable and as such it has been duly escalated.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
