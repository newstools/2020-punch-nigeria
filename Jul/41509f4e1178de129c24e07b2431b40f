Oladimeji Ramon The International Chamber of Commerce Nigeria has appealed to the Federal Government to find a lasting solution to the problem of insecurity bedeviling the country, saying the survival of many Small and Medium-scale Enterprises is being threatened. The ICCN, which described the SMEs as the bedrock for economic emancipation of nations, said the government must create a conducive environment for their operation because they were vital in Nigeria’s effort to survive the economic hardship occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chairman, ICC Nigeria, Babatunde Savage, said this at the virtual Annual General Meeting of the organisation, with the theme, “SMEs, bedrock of economic recovery after COVID-19 pandemic,” held on July 9. Savage said, “The business environment has remained hostile due to illegal touting activities by hoodlums, armed robbery, kidnapping activities, Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East, banditry in the North-West, etc. “Certainly, we cannot continue this way; we need to ensure that peace prevails and becomes the order of the day to strengthen the economic recovery process after the COVID-19 pandemic. “We therefore wish to suggest the need for governments at all levels to intensify their efforts in making the environment more conducive for the SMEs because the subsector constitutes the bedrock for economic emancipation anywhere in the world.” He said while Nigeria moved 15 places up on the ease of doing business index last year, “the country still has anti-business variables that stifle operations of businesses.” The ICCN urged the government to ensure that the COVID-19 support being given to SMEs got to the target end.
