John Alechenu, Abuja The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress Caretaker/ Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni; his Kano State counterpart, Abdullahi Ganduje; and the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, have arrived the APC National Secretariat for the inauguration of the Edo State National Governorship Campaign Council. Other early callers include Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, and Senator Andy Uba among others. Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the partyâ€™s candidate for the September 19 governorship election in Edo, would face Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party, amongst other major contenders. Ganduje, who is APC Edo Campaign Chairman, said the opposition Peoples Democratic Party took Obaseki in because he was in control of the state treasury. Ganduje said this while addressing Journalists soon after the campaign council was inaugurated at the APC National Secretariat, Abuja, on Monday. He also said the APC was not bothered about the governor Nyesom Wike-led Peoples Democratic Party National Campaign Council because the APC has a candidate who has all it takes to win the governorship elections.
