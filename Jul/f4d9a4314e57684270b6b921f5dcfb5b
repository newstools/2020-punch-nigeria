Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A group of hoodlums led by a man simply identified as ‘Ikeja’ and some Hausa traders clashed on Saturday in Osun State. Although the cause of the clash was not yet known, heavily armed policemen were seen moving towards the Sabo area of Osogbo, the state capital. Many were reportedly injured in the clash but no casualty has been confirmed as of the time of filing this report. Police Public Relations Officer for Osun State Command told our correspondent that “policemen have been deployed to the scene. The situation is under control.” Speaking to our correspondent, a resident of Sabo, Babatunde Ojo, linked Saturday’s clash to an altercation involving a Hausa commercial motorcyclist and a mechanic on Friday. Ojo said the Hausa bikeman reportedly rode in a reckless manner and nearly hit a mechanic walking along Sabo/Oja Oba Road. He said, “When the mechanic complained about what the Okada rider did, there was exchange of hot words. The Okada rider rushed to a table belonging to a tea seller, picked a knife and attacked the mechanic. But the knife did not penetrate the man’s body. “In retaliation, the mechanic who had some of his tools with him, hit the rider with an iron rod and the rider slumped. I don’t know whether he died or not. “Other Hausa men in the area rushed to the scene and attempted to attack the Yoruba mechanic. Some hoodlums that were also around the area also rushed down and it became a free for all.”
