Watford head into Sunday’s Premier League clash with Arsenal knowing that they will likely need at least a point to have any chance of avoiding relegation. The managerless Hornets are in the bottom three heading into the final round of fixtures, behind 17th-placed Aston Villa on goal difference, while Arsenal are 10th and have one eye on next weekend’s FA Cup final. Watford’s destiny is no longer in their own hands following a dramatic round of midweek action that saw Villa stun Arsenal 1-0, shortly after Watford had crashed 4-0 to Manchester City. Watford have to better the Villans’ result against West Ham, with goal difference possibly coming into the mix, and the Hornets are currently one goal worse off than Villa in that regard. It is not out of the question that a third deciding factor will have to be used to separate the sides, which is goals scored – a deficit Watford, six goals worse off than Villa, are unlikely to make up.

This fixture is perhaps not as daunting on the face of it as it may seem, however, even if Watford have only won two of their last nine games since an incredible 3-0 win over Liverpool on February 29. That is largely down to the fact that Arsenal have little to play for on the final weekend, with eighth place now the best they can hope for after the 1-0 loss to Villa in midweek.
