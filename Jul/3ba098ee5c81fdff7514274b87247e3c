Samson Folarin The Lagos State Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola, has asked the new permanent secretaries and chief executive officers of agencies in the state public service to justify their appointments by being proactive in the discharge of their duties. He urged them to see the positions as trust that come with high expectations. A statement on Thursday said Muri-Okunola spoke at the virtual induction of the new leaders. According to the statement, the head of service said the officers, as highly experienced senior public servants and accounting officers, must provide leadership and direction for the agencies under them. He noted that their actions, decisions, comments, utterances and directives had “far reaching implications, not only on the directive principles of state policies and government business, but on the lives of all members of staff.” The Permanent Secretary, Public Service Office, Mr Bashir Braimoh (rtd), in his presentation, titled, ‘The Role of Accounting Officers in the Actualisation of Assignment of Ministerial Responsibilities,’ urged the inductees to manage effectively the resources committed to their care. He pointed out that the way forward was for them to embrace a multi-sectoral synergy approach and be abreast of all the functions, processes as well as procedures of governance. Braimoh said this would enhance productivity and service delivery to residents of the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
