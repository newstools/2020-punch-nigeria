Daud  Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State Government has replaced the striking resident doctors  working  at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital  Isolation Centre, Sagamu, with  volunteer  doctors. The Association of Resident Doctors  had last week asked their colleagues  who were working at the centre to join them in their ongoing strike which commenced  on July 1, 2020 over   alleged failure of the government to meet their welfare demands. The Commissioner for  Health,  Dr Tomi Coker,  said the striking doctors at the isolation centre had been replaced. She said, “Only two doctors at the isolation are ARD members. They have been replaced by other doctors who are happy to serve the people of Ogun State by volunteering at the isolation centre.” The Secretary, ARD,OOUTH, Dr Tope Osundara, confirmed the replacement, adding that the doctors were hopeful that the government would call for a meeting this week.
