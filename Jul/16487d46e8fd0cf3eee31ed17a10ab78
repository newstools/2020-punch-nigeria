Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Four suspects transporting precious stones under the cover of darkness from Osogbo, Osun State, to an undisclosed location in Lagos State have been arrested by men of the Amotekun Corps. The suspects, travelling in two trucks filled with the items, were said to have left Oba Oke, a town in the Olorunda North Local Council Development Area, late Monday, heading for Lagos. But following a tip-off by residents, the trucks were intercepted by the Amotekun Corps on the Osogbo/Iwo road bypass around 7.30pm. When contacted on Tuesday, the Director General of the Amotekun Corps in Osun, Mr Amitolu Shittu, confirmed the arrest. He said, “I led our men to the point where the suspects were interpreted around Lameco area in Osogbo at about 7.30pm. The four suspects were travelling in two separate trucks fully loaded with precious stones at the time we arrested them. “The suspects told us that they were heading for Lagos and insisted they were registered miners. But so far, we don’t have any proof that they are registered miners. We have handed them over to the police. The impounded trucks are also with the police.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
