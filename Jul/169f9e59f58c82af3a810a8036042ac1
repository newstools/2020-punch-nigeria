Ebenezer Bajela New head coach of Abia Warriors Imama Amapakabo has warned officials of the Nigeria Professional Premier League side not to impose players on the technical crew. Speaking to journalists at his unveiling in Umuahia on Wednesday, the former national U-23 coach said he was ready to respect and honour his contract terms but would walk away should the club try to impose any player on him. He said, “I want to state it categorically that Imama Amapakabo is not the one that can have players imposed on. I won’t be here because I will walk away.” Also commenting on his backroom staff, the 1985 U-17 World Cup winner said he would welcome whoever the management appointed to work with him. “It is the responsibility of the management to tell me who I work with or who I don’t work with. I think my contract terms are clear and I want to respect and honour my contract terms and I believe that the management will also honour the contract terms,” Imama added. The gaffer, who won the NPFL title with Enugu Rangers in 2016, also hinted on what to expect from his new team next season. He stated, “Everybody knows that no matter where I go, I want to play, I want to play and enjoy good football. If I don’t enjoy football, what is the point? “I want to build a team that even when the LMC chairman comes to watch our games, he will enjoy himself. This is what I want to bring to Abia Warriors. “My personality precedes my person, when I was coming here, everyone said I am back in the league and I will win the league. For me, it is a plus and for Abia Warriors.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
