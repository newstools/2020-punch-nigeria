Ebenezer Bajela martin Schmidt, former manager of Victor Osimhen at Wolfsburg has explained why the Nigeria international was unable to break into the squad during his time in the German Bundesliga. Osimhen made just 12 appearances for The Wolves and was unable to find the back of the net during two seasons at the club that was blighted by injuries. Speaking on Radio Kiss Kiss, a Naples-based radio station; Schmidt blamed Osimhen’s poor performance in Germany on inexperience and the competition from big names like Mario Gomez and Divock Origi, but expressed confidence that Osimhen would come good at Napoli. He said, “At Wolfsburg, he did not explode because in his experience after the World Cup in Chile he was just 17 years old, he was very young. “And then there was a lot of competition, Mario Gomez and Origi were big-name players but we could see that he is a real diamond. “Osimhen is ready for Napoli, today he is mature despite the young boy age. His experiences at Charleroi and Lille have left him even stronger and I am sure that in Italy he will be able to do very well.”   Napoli are expected to announce the signing of the 21-year-old from Lille any time soon and Schmidt, while highlighting the qualities of the youngster, also mentioned the area he would need to improve on. He added, “Osimhen is a good player, good at aggressive pressing and a game-changer. “He is a box-to-box player, he has quality, a lot of speed, but above all, he has a great heart and a great mentality. He can play both with the 4-3-3 and with the 4-2-3-1, from offensive terminal. “He is a predestined. He can improve in tactics and Italian football will help him in this. He can improve his left.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
