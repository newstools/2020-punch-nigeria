Ada Wodu, Calabar Passersby found twins abandoned by their mother in a dustbin dead on Friday morning in Calabar, Cross River State. An eyewitness, Randy Emmanuel, said the dead twins were found in a dustbin located at Goldie by Mayne Avenue. He said, “Around 7:30am when we were returning from the church, we went through Mayne Avenue by Goldie where there is a dustbin. We saw the twins. By then they were lifeless. I don’t know if they were alive when they dumped them there. “Around 9am, someone passed there and returned home to tell us about it. That morning, everybody who passed there watched the dead kids and since I was with my phone, I had to snap it.” It was gathered that the bodies were evacuated from the scene later in the day by some officials. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, said she was not aware of the incident. She added, “They have been calling me in respect of that. I have called all the divisions to ask if they saw any twins and they said no. I don’t know where they took the twins to. Nobody has reported to the police.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
