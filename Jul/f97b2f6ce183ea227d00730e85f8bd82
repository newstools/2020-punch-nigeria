Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna A former governor of old Kaduna State, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, said on Sunday that the National Consultative Forum would address the misgovernance of the country. Musa also said he accepted membership of the the new political group (NCF) to salvage Nigeria from the current challenges bedeviling her. Recall that NCF announced its formation recently with Col. Abubakar Umar (retd.), who is a former military governor, among other prominent Nigerians as members. But the former governor and a former Nigerian Bar Association president, Olisa Agbakoba, Femi Falana (SAN), distanced themselves from the new political group. Musa, alongside other members of the forum, stated at a joint press conference held at his residence in Kaduna, that Nigeria was being misgoverned, adding that the country was in dire need of good governance.
