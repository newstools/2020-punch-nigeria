Oladimeji Ramon The Electoral Committee of the Nigerian Bar Association has declared Olumide Akpata winner of the NBA presidential poll, which held electronically between 11pm on Wednesday and 11pm on Thursday. The Chairman of the ECNBA, Chief Tawo Tawo (SAN), announced at the end of the poll late last night that Akpata polled 9,891 votes to defeat Dr Babatunde Ajibade (SAN) and Mr Dele Adesina (SAN). Ajibade emerged first runner-up with 4,328 votes while Adesina picked the rear with 3,982 votes. Though a total of 29,636 lawyers were accredited to vote in the e-election, only 18,256 succeeded in casting their ballots.
Akpata scored 54.3 per cent of the cast votes to emerge winner. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Adesina, on Thursday, described the association’s national officers’ election as a sham and called on the electoral committee to cancel it. The call is contained in his petition which he personally signed and addressed to the electoral committee chairman on Thursday. He alleged in the petition that the voter register used for the election contained “grave errors” which violated the provisions of the NBA constitution. “I  call on you  Mr  Chairman and members of the  Electoral  Committee of the Nigerian  Bar  Association to cancel this sham Election. “It is needless to say that if the process is bad,  the product cannot be good. Thank you,” he stated.
