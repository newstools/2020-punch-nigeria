He said, “My brother, No feud at all. The GMD (Mele Kyari) is my very close friend and ally. He has been super supportive. I’m leaving to return to my family in the United States. “I have been in NNPC for five years mostly away from them. With the pandemic, I can’t travel to visit them and they can’t come to visit me. It’s tough. At the core, I’m a family man. Stepping down solely for personal family reasons. That’s the truth.”
