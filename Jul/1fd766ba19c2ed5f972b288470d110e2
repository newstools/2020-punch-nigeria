John Charles Makurdi Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State on Saturday declared that the result of his COVID-19 test was negative. Ortom disclosed this while confirming the positive status of his wife, Mrs Eunice Ortom, son and top government functionaries, as well as his domestic staff. The governor, who said he had gone into self-isolation since the disease had hit his family, however, promised to go for another round of COVID-19 test this week. While displaying the result of his test, Ortom advised people of the state to learn a lesson from the positive status of the first family in the state that no one is immune to the dreaded disease. He warned the people to adhere strictly to the protocol set up by the World Health Organisation, urging people to stay alive and that life has no duplicate. “Though, I have my result here; which shows that I’m negative, but I will still go for another test in the next few days now that my family has been hit by COVID-19,” Ortom said.
