Tunde Oyekola the Kwara State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has urged the Speaker and leadership of the state House of Assembly to swear in its candidate for Ilorin South constituency, Raheem Agboola, as ordered by the Appeal Court. The Appeal Court at its sitting in Ilorin, on Wednesday, held that the All Progressives Congress had no candidate for the Ilorin South constituency in the March 10,2019 election. It subsequently declared Agboola as the winner of the election. The PDP, in a statement signed by its state Chairman, Kola Shittu, on Thursday, asked the Speaker, Yakubu Danladi, to swear-in Agboola without further delay. Shitu said the people of the state were disappointed, “in the manner the Speaker disregarded the court judgement and (was) flaunting his disrespect to judiciary and the nation’s constitution.” The PDP noted that the judgement delivered by the appellate court “clearly indicated the Speaker cooked excuses to prevent Agboola from being sworn-in since November 2019 as any litigation was supposed to come after his swearing-in.” It, therefore, called on the Speaker to swear-in Agboola and treat his swearing-in as matter of urgency, upon the resumption of plenary. The party chairman said, “Your immediate compliance with the court’s ruling will indicate the level of respect the assembly’s leadership accord to the people of the state and prevent Kwara from being perceived as a lawless state.” Copyright PUNCH.
