Ted Odogwu, Kano The Kano Council of Ulamas, on Monday, rejected a proposal by the Kano State House of Assembly that rapists should be castrated. The state House of Assembly had adopted the proposal for the castration of confirmed rapists, following a motion sponsored by a member, Mr Nuraddeen Alhassan, on July 15, 2020. A communiqué, signed by the Council’s Chairman, Sheik Ibrahim Khalil, and made available to The PUNCH, noted that the council opposed the proposed castration, after due consultations, hence it was advocating a review of the Kano State Shari’a Penal Code 2000. Khalil, however, pointed out that the council’s position did not mean they were supporting the criminal act of rapists. He said  the council had resolved to visit the House of Assembly for advice and possible solutions in line with Islamic injunction.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
