Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta No fewer than 148 students were sworn in by the management of Chrisland University, Abeokuta at a virtual matriculation ceremony to kick-start the 2019/ 2020 academic session. The students, who were sworn-in at a zoom meeting which had over 350 participants, were admitted into three colleges; College of Management and Social Sciences; College of Natural and Applied Sciences, and College of Basic Medical Science. Speaking at the fifth matriculation ceremony, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof Chinedum Babalola, lamented that COVID-19 disrupted the ceremony which was earlier slated for March. Babalola, however, said the university was able to adapt to the new normal because of its commitment to becoming an Information Technology-driven tertiary institution. The vice-chancellor said, “This matriculation was slated for March, our usual matriculation period, but alas, it was disrupted by four months. “Indeed, this is our year and session of New Things/New Beginning at Chrisland University. You will recall that we termed this session/year, the session/year of New Beginning. I did mention that we will change the ways of doing things at Chrisland University including the fact that technology will speak for us this session. Without knowing it, COVID-19 has practically brought our education to the e-learning mode.”
