Peter David, Benin City The Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, has warned politicians against turning the state into a war zone. The Benin monarch in a statement on Wednesday titled, ‘Appeal for peace in Edo State,’ by the Secretary of Benin Traditional Council, Frank Irabor, observed with dismay the unruly behaviour of some youths at the palace gate on July 25. Supporters of the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party engaged in an affray around the palace of the Oba of Benin shortly the inauguration of Governor Godwin Obaseki’s re-election campaign. The Oba, who reiterated that the palace remained apolitical, said he was committed to peace and tranquillity in the forthcoming governorship election. The statement read, “We are surprised to hear later that there was an incident outside the Palace, directly in front of Oredo Local Government secretariat. His Royal Majesty condemns this unruly behaviour that occurred in front of the Palace. “We wish to emphasise once more that the Benin Throne is not partisan. The BTC uses this medium to advise all political party members not to turn Edo State into a war zone because of gubernatorial ambition.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
