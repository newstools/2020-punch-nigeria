Grace Edema The management of the University of Lagos has said that the Academic Staff Union of Universities’ threat to disrupt the forthcoming council of the institution meeting is against the law. In a recent report, ASUU had threatened a showdown with UNILAG’s if its Pro-Chancellor, Dr Wale Babalakin, should visit the institution. In a statement on Sunday, the Registrar and Secretary to Council, Oladejo Azeez, UNILAG, said ASUU had shown clearly that it was a group that did not adhere to the Constitution of Nigeria or the Trade Union law, which it was a part of. The statement read in part, “ASUU as a trade union under the laws of Nigeria is also expected to know that Section 4 of the Trade Union Act states that ‘No person shall subject any other person to any form of constraint or restriction in the course of persuasion.’” Copyright PUNCH.
