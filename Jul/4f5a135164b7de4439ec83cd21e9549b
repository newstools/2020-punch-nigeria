Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The crisis rocking Imo State House of Assembly has yet to abate  as the lawmaker representing Njaba state constituency, Uju Onwudiwe, has petitioned the Speaker, Collins Chiji, over an alleged attack on her by Sam Otuibe, who represents Ahiazu Mbaise state constituency. In the  petition Onwudiwe alleged that Otuibe attacked her with a bottle and class cup with the intent to kill her on July 6 during a caucus meeting of lawmakers who are members of the ruling All Progressives Congress. The petition which was sighted by our correspondent in Owerri on Thursday stated that the incident happened at the Owerri residence of the deputy speaker, Amara Iwuanyanwu. Onwudiwe said she was under intense pressure from husband, children and constituents to seek legal redress over the incident. She threatened that should the Speaker fail to sanction Otuibe after seven days of the receipt of the petition she would proceed with a criminal complainant and civil right suit against the lawmaker. The petition partly read, “Mr Speaker sir, this unwarranted violent assault on me with wine bottle and glass during a meeting of legislators and presided by your esteemed self, was a serious threat to my life, a violent conduct, abuse of my privileges as a lawmaker and gross violation of our House Rules which forbids any member of the House from attacking a colleague no matter the level of provocation.” When contacted, Otuibe insisted that he did not attack Onwudiwe.
