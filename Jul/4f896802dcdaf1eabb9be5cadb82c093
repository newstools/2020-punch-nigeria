China’s coronavirus-delayed Super League football season will begin on July 25, the Chinese Football Association announced Wednesday. The top-flight competition, which had been orginally due to kick-off in February, would open with fixtures in the cities of Dalian and Suzhou and “strictly abide by the requirements of national epidemic prevention work,” said the CFA.
