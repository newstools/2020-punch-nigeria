Tukur Muntari, Kano Flood has washed away two bridges in the Rimingado and Tofa local government areas of Kano State. The Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency, Dr Sale Jili, said in Kano on Sunday that the incident which happened on Wednesday, had cut off many towns and villages from the headquarters of the two local government areas. He said the flood which was caused by torrential rain, had also cut off the two local government areas from the state capital. “One of the affected bridges is in Watari village which links Ungoggo LGA to Tofa LGA, while the second bridge is between Tamawa village and Karofin Yashi village in the Rimingado LGA. “So many villages have been cut off from the headquarters of the two local government areas while the two areas have also been cut off from the state capital,” Jili said. He said the flood which affected seven local government areas, had affected no fewer than 3,954 people. “The Nigerian Meteorological Agency had predicted flood in some local government areas in some states, including Kano,” he said. He said SEMA had since forwarded its comprehensive report to the state government for immediate assistance to the victims of the disaster. He called on Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to release funds to enable the agency to provide interim support to the victims to alleviate their sufferings. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
