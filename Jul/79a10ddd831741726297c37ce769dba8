Johnny Edward Victor Osimhen is on the verge of joining Napoli from Lille this summer, with the deal set to be announced on Friday, The PUNCH reports. The PUNCH reported on Monday that Osimhen’s move to Napoli was delayed by negotiations over the striker’s image rights. However, the 21-year-old will make his much-awaited switch to the Naples outfit with Gennaro Gattuso’s side set to pay €80m for the Nigeria international after reaching an agreement with Los Douges. “There’s an agreement already with Napoli, so we wait for the announcement on Friday,” his agent and brother-in-law, Stanley Okolo, told The PUNCH. Should the deal be completed, Osimhen will become Nigeria and Africa’s most expensive footballer. He will eclipse the African record held by Ivory Coast’s Nicolas Pepe, who also moved from Lille to Arsenal for £72m last summer. Osimhen scored 18 goals and provided six assists in 38 games across all competitions for Lille and was voted the club’s Player of The Year last season, winning the Marc-Vivien Foe prize for the best African footballer in Ligue 1 in the process.
