Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The Southern Kaduna Peoples Union on Tuesday decried the continued imposition of curfew on two local government areas in the southern part of the state. Following heightened tension over the killing of a teacher, Yusuf  Magaji, by some bandits in his farm in Zango Kataf, the Kaduna State Government imposed a 24-hour curfew on  Zangon Kataf and Kauru LGAs. Since the imposition of the curfew apparently to check the escalation of a possible crisis, the government has yet to lift curfew, 19 days after. A statement Tuesday by Luka Binniyat, the National Public Relations Officer of SOKAPU, an umbrella body of the Southern Kaduna people, said the curfew was taking an excruciating toll on the people, majority who were farmers. The SOKAPU called on the National Assembly, the Nigeria Human Rights Commission, well meaning Nigerians, as well as the international community to intervene in the matter. Copyright PUNCH.
