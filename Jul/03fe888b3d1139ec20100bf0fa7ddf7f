A former Minister of National Planning, Dr Shamsuddeen Usman, has joined the Dantiye Centre for Good Leadership and Journalism. The announcement was made in a letter signed by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the DCLJ, Emeritus Professor Munzali Jibril. Jibril said the decision to appoint Usman as the Honorary Economic and Regional Adviser of the DCLJ was taken because of his “contributions to the economic development and stability of Nigeria and countries in the West African sub-region” and also because of his passion for service. He said he hoped that Usman, who was also Nigeria’s Finance minister between 2007 and 2009, would use his vast experience to continue to mentor young people and “tackle the multifarious development problems” facing the country and the continent. The DCLJ is a non-governmental and a not-for-profit organisation, with a coterie of professionals set up to promote good leadership and excellent journalism. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
