The PZ Cussons Foundation has donated soaps to the Lagos State Ministry of Health as part of its support to control the spread of COVID-19 in Lagos State. The company, in a statement on Tuesday, said the donation received by the Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Ministry of Health, Dr Olusegun Ogboye, would encourage hand washing. The foundation said it had previously donated soaps to over 40,000 people in six major cities across Nigeria in collaboration with the Foundation for Refugee Economic Empowerment. Speaking on the donation in Lagos, the Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Foundation, Prof. Eyitayo Lambo, said, “After learning that one of the simplest ways to stay protected against the coronavirus is by consistent hand washing with soap, we made a commitment to support the effort of government in its fight against the spread of the virus. He explained that the foundation started with the Northern part of the country as there were quite a number of vulnerable persons there and considered Lagos State due to the surge in the number of cases in the state. According to him, the goal is to support the tremendous efforts of the Lagos State Government, as well as encourage Lagosians to stay protected by washing their hands regularly. While expressing appreciation to PZ Cussons Foundation, Ogboye said the donations would go a long away in supporting the state’s efforts in preventing the further spread of the coronavirus.
