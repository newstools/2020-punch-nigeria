Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The Federal Government has disclosed plans to force the Digital Satellite Television, owned by MultiChoice, a South Africa-based cable service provider, to provide pay-per-view options to Nigerian subscribers. The government also said it has amended Nigeria’s broadcasting code to prevent DSTV from monopolising its channels and contents. This is just as the House of Representatives ordered the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission to ask DSTV to reverse its subscription rates introduced on June 1, 2020.
