Sampson Itode, P/ Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has suspended a Permanent Secretary, Sunny Okere, for flouting and obstructing the enforcement of COVID-19 guidelines in the state. The governor, who disclosed the suspension of Okere on Wednesday, during his statewide broadcast, added that such would serve as a deterrent to other errant public officials. Wike also announced the inauguration of a task force that would enforce the wearing of face masks in the state and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew from 8pm to 6am on the Bonny Local Government Area and Onne Community in the Eleme Local Government Area with effect from July 10, 2020. He said, “Burial ceremonies are also reportedly being conducted in clear breach of the 50 persons maximum attendance limit, such that a serving Permanent Secretary had the temerity to chase away officials of the State Ministry of Health who went to enforce the established guidelines on public burials at Oyigbo. “The Permanent Secretary, Establishment, Mr. Sunny Okere, has been relieved of his appointment with immediate effect for flouting and obstructing the enforcement of the guidelines on public burials. This should serve as a lesson to all other public officers who may wish to be irresponsible.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
