’Tana Aiyejina Plans have reached an advanced stage to have Nigerian sports return with non-combat sports, with table tennis, tennis and track and field events set for an early return, Minister for Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare has stated. Speaking on Voice of Nigeria’s Issues in The News, Dare admitted there was no fixed date yet for the return of the non-combat sports. He added that the ministry would observe global practice in ensuring a safe return of sporting activities in the country. “We hope that our athletes can get back to action soon with non-combat sports, although no date has been set. But we must submit to the COVID-19 protocols in line with the practice all over the world. We have submitted our protocol and hopefully, our athletes will soon be back to compete,” the minister said. Dare’s announcement comes after the Chairman, Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, stated in Abuja on Monday that sports and other activities, which involved large gatherings, might remain shut down following the rising cases of COVID-19 in the country. Mustapha said the COVID-19 statistics were not encouraging, adding that there would be no room for compromise. “The rising and domestic statistics shows that COVID-19 has not given any relaxation, therefore we cannot afford to slow down and we must never compromise in more sectors including those with potential large gatherings like sports and all interactions between groups of people,” he stated.
