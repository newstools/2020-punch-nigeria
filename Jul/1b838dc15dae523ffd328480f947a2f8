Johnny Edward Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes Bukayo Saka will be a good addition to the England senior squad and will offer him his advice on where to switch his allegiance if consulted. Saka scored four goals with 11 assists in 38 games during his breakthrough season for the Gunners. He has also represented England at the U-16 and U-19 levels. He is courted by both England and Nigeria, whom he is also eligible to play for. Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham previously turned down the chance to play for the Super Eagles. However, Alex Iwobi, Victor Moses and Shola Ameobi pledged their allegiances to Nigeria after featuring for the youth teams of England. “If I get asked the question then I can give my opinion,” Arteta told Daily Mail. “He hasn’t come to me with that, so, for now, I will leave it totally independent with the player and his family as they normally have a big say with their background, their culture and where they are coming from. I don’t want to step in there. “Absolutely (he is good enough to play for England) – and he’s very clever to make the right decision, as well.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
