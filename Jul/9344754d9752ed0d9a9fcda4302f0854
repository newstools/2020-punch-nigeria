Toni Ufoh Ex-Super Eagles winger, Victor Moses, has agreed terms with Inter Milan till August, after extending his loan deal with the Nerazzurri. The Nigerian joined the Italian side in January from his parent club, Chelsea, after a loan stint at Turkish side Fenerbahce. Moses, who is recovering from injury, has also embarked on loan deals to Liverpool, Stoke City and West Ham since he joined Chelsea in 2012. “A new agreement has been reached between the clubs, which means Moses will be on loan at Inter until August 31, and will be available to play for Inter in the Europa League. If Chelsea don’t agree a deal to sell him before that date, he will leave Inter,” SempreInter.com said via Corriere dello Sport. The 2013 African Cup of Nations winner has made 12 appearances across all competitions, providing three assists but yet to score a goal, since his arrival at the club in January. Copyright PUNCH.
