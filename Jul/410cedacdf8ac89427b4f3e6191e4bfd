Abiodun Nejo, Ado-Ekiti the Peoples Democratic Party in Ekiti State was on Monday unsettled by a viral video, which showed some members loyal to former governor, Ayodele Fayose, purportedly swearing to an oath. In the five-minute video, during a meeting of ward leaders and executives in the Ijero council area, the attendees took turns to make a vow to be loyal to Fayose and promised not to betray him. Leaders at the meeting included former state PDP Chairman, Chief Bola Olu-Ojo; former House of Assembly member, Akinleye Ekundayo; and Mr Mike Adeosun. A source in the PDP expressed the belief that the move was taken to prevent some of the leaders and ward executives from shifting allegiance from Fayose to Senator Biodun Olujimi. The PDP in Ekiti State has been polarised between the groups loyal to Fayose and Olujimi in the battle for the soul of the party. But a former PDP state chairman, Olu-Ojo, “It was not oath-taking, but affirmation of loyalty to our leader, Fayose. “There was nothing secret. It was an open meeting. It was not oath-taking because in the course of activities, there was no Bible, Quran, iron, blood or any other object to swear with.” Also reacting, Fayose, who spoke through his media aide, Lere Olayinka, said, “There was no oath-taking anywhere. Did you see Fayose in that video? Did you see any object like Bible, Quran or iron? If no, how does that amount to oath-taking?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
