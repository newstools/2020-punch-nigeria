In a statement on Wednesday, Abubakar said Arotile was “a very intelligent, disciplined, confident and courageous young officer who added value wherever she served.” He added, “As a squadron pilot in Operation GAMA AIKI in Minna, Niger State, she flew her quota of anti-banditry combat missions to ensure a safer, more secured Nigeria. “I recall meeting her at the Minna Airport, while on operational visit, after one of such missions and seeing her eagerness to contribute towards the restoration of lasting peace to the affected areas. Her death is a huge loss to the Nigerian Air Force family and indeed the entire Nation. “On behalf officers, airmen, airwomen and civilian staff of the Nigerian Air Force, I once more condole with the family of late Flying Officer Arotile over this irreparable loss and sincerely pray that the Almighty God grants her soul eternal rest.”
