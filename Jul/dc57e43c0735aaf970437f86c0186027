Joseph Olaoluwa The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, on Friday, authorised the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria to reopen Benin and Jos airports. The approval was contained in two separate statements signed by the Director-General of the NCAA, Capt. Musa Nuhu, and entitled ‘Restart plan approval.’ The airports were instructed to reopen after satisfactorily meeting the NCAA requirements. The statement said, “Therefore, having satisfactorily fulfilled most of the requirements of the All Operators Letter of 18th May 2020 with ref: NCAADG/GC/8/16/302 and Advisory Circulars: NCAA-AC-ADR-007 and NCAA-AC-AMS-002 as amended on Post Covid-19 Restart Guidelines and Health Protocols, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria is hereby authorised to resume normal operations at Benin Airport, Benin. “Kindly note all standards and protocols applied to the above airports shall be implemented in other airports operated by FAAN for authorisation by NCAA for the resumption of operations.” The NCAA, however, stressed that both airports must observe all guidelines issued by it and the Nigerian public health authorities on the implementation of Public Health Corridor and Aviation Security.
