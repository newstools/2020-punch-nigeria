Joseph Olaoluwa Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, has said the true test of road user compliance with the partial closure of the Third Mainland Bridge would be accessed on Monday (today). Oladeinde said this Saturday in an interview with our correspondent while he monitored traffic situation on the bridge. The partial closure of the bridge started on Friday and it is expected to last six months. The commissioner, who said the government was observing the traffic situation, said, “I think the true test will be Monday but we have Saturday and Sunday to observe the situation and put out the signs. “If people know where to go, compliance is 100 per cent but if they do not know where to go, that’s where the problem is. This is why we are sensitising stakeholders and going around.” The commissioner who called for calm amongst road users stressed that the closure was partial. He also noted that the partial closure was based on time. He added, “In the morning, people going from the mainland to the Island can access the bridge from midnight to noon. Between noon and 1pm, we will clear the bridge and then switch.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
