Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki A federal highway police patrol team on Thursday shot dead a suspected armed robber on Abakaliki-Ogoja Road in Ebonyi State. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs Loveth Odah, confirmed the incident. Odah claimed that two policemen were shot during a gun duel with the deceased and his gang members. She said the robbers mounted a road block at Nwezienyi junction and robbed unsuspecting passengers around 1am on Thursday. The spokesperson said, “After we got a tip-off from road users, the Izzi Police Division swiftly swung into action. When they got there as usual, they released harassing gunshots to know if the hoodlums were still in operation. “But to their surprise, the place was calm. So, some jumped down to dismantle the road block. Unfortunately, the hoodlums opened fire on them and the team leader was shot in the stomach, while another policeman was hit in the cheek. “At the end of the day, one of the hoodlums was gunned down. One AK-47 rifle with one exhausted magazine and many empty shells were recovered. “The motorcycle the hoodlums used was also recovered, as well as the charm the deceased used as his bullet-proof power. Unfortunately for him, the charm disappointed him yesterday (Thursday). The hoodlum who was gunned down is yet to be identified.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
