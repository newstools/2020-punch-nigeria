Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo. Seven cows belonging to a Fulani herder, identified only as Alhaji Abdullahi, in Elepo village, Ifon, Osun State, were in the early hours of Tuesday struck dead by lightning. The incident, which reportedly occurred during an early morning rain, threw the village into panic. The cows were said to have been tethered to a place in the village, when a loud deafening noise was heard around where the animals were kept. Seven of them were found dead after the incident, though there were more cows on tether at the spot that were not affected. A resident of Ifon, Alao Saheed, said it was the first time such an incident would occur in the town. He called on relevant government agencies to remove the dead animals to prevent the outbreak of an epidemic. The Seriki Fulani in Osun State, Alhaji Sulaimon Oloruntoyin, confirmed the incident to our correspondent. Oloruntoyin told PUNCH Metro that the cows belonged to Alhaji Abdullahi, the son of the Seriki Fulani of Ifon Orolu. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
