Peter David, Benin City Over 5000 youths across the 18 Local Government Areas of Edo State under the aegis of the Edo Patriotic Youth Movement on Thursday endorsed the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, for the September 19 election. The endorsement was disclosed during a meeting between selected representatives of the group and the APC candidate, as well as other APC leaders. This is coming after some political appointees of the Governor Godwin Obaseki recently resigned their appointment in support of Ize-Iyamu. Receiving the endorsement alongside his running mate, Mallam Gani Audu, the APC governorship candidate thanked the youths and reassured them that his government would prioritise job creation and youth empowerment. He criticised the incumbent administration for implementing harsh policies and prolonged detentions of the poor over their inability to pay unfair fines and taxes. Ize-Iyamu said, “Government should solve problems, not lament, fold its hand, and insult people. I have an agenda of what I will do, the incumbent has nothing to show after four years in office.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
