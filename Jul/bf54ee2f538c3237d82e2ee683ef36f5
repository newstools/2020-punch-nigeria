Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt A factional Caretaker Committee Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, in Rivers State, Dr. Sokonte Davies, has said the perceived standoff between the Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, and former Senator representing Rivers South-East, Magnus Abe, was not responsible for the party’s crisis in Rivers State. Davies, said this during a press briefing in Port Harcourt, on Wednesday. He said, “Nobody owns the grassroots. There is no faction at the grassroots level. Magnus and Amaechi are not in contention; the problem in Rivers APC is mismanagement of ambition and grievances. “We have the capacity to run the party and make it enjoyable in the state. We are not taking anyone to court. We want to build the party and to strengthen it and to carry everyone along. “We have tried to reach out to all of those we feel are aggrieved; we have called them personally to discuss. We have started a reconciliation process on time headed by Senators Andrew Uchendu and Wilson Ake.” Davies further said, “Igo Aguma was granted the privilege to be Chairman of the Caretaker Committee and other statutory members are not challenging the court’s judgement. We are only saying, Aguma contravened the order of the court by running the party as a sole administrator from his private residence, taking unilateral decisions. Each time he is questioned for that, he gives flimsy excuses; that is why he was suspended.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
