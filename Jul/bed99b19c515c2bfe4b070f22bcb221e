John Alechenu, Abuja The Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akerodolu SAN, has vowed to defeat his deputy, Agboola Ajayi, in his ward. He also said the emergence of Eyitayo Jegede as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, would in no way scuttle his re-election bid. Akeredolu said this in an interview with newsmen soon after defending himself before the Ondo APC Governorship Primary Election Appeal Committee, at the party’s National Secretariat, in Abuja, on Monday. In response to questions about the defection of his deputy, to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, the governor said, “For me, the deputy leaving the APC to return to the PDP is good riddance to bad rubbish. “We thought we could accommodate him at the APC but since he returned to where he truly belongs, it is all well and good. I always wish people the best I can. “He has made a case that he helped me to win, let him help him to win and we will confirm that he is popular. “What I know is that he is of no importance, he has no hold on any local government, I can assure you that come during the election, I will defeat him in his local government and he will never recover from it.” He advised the deputy governor to remain with the PDP candidate and prayed that the Ondo Governorship campaigns will be issue based. The governor also said he was reaching out to aspirants who contested against him as well as party stakeholders to unite the party ahead of the October 10 governorship election. Copyright PUNCH.
