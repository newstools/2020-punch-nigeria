Fisayo Odumuyiwa The founder, Concerned Parents and Educators Initiative, Yinka Ogunde, has called for a campaign for education reforms in Nigeria. Ogunde made the call on Tuesday in Lagos during a press briefing with stakeholders on her concern about the decay in the education sector. “There is perhaps no better time than now to embark on this advocacy for change. A former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, once said that education is the most powerful weapon which can be used to change the world,”she said. Ogunde said parents and stakeholders in the education sector needed to come together to deliberate on ways of improving the standard of education. “We need to empower teachers with the necessary information and skills, support parents, protect our children and ensure that we have better outcomes in our schools,” she added. Ogunde said CPE was ready to use its 116,000 members across Nigeria in talking about issues that were critical in the education sector and proffering solutions to the multiple challenges inherent there. She added, “We need to advocate and show parents across the country how to steer the wheel of sustainable development and holistic transformation in the education sector. She added that many people complain that graduates were unemployable without proffering solutions to this problem. “If we don’t do anything, nothing is going to change. We need people who will be able to take ownership of the problem and not just talk about the problem,” she said. A member of the board of trustees, Jole Layi-Babatunde, said parents had a major role to play in their children’s lives, no matter the standard of their school. Copyright PUNCH.
