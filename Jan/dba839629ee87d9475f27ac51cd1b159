We are going the whole nine yards. “From the mega station in Ebute Metta to Apapa and all the way to Ibadan. A large chunk of this rail line is in Oyo State. “Looking at the state of work in Apapa, completing the project in April doesn’t seem feasible, especially the extension of the rail line to the seaport. “We’ll, however, continue to work and redouble our efforts to complete the project and meet set targets.” See photos from the inspection:
