About 50 directors, deputy directors and assistant directors at the Federal Inland Revenue Service have been redeployed in a major shake-up at the agency. A report by an online medium, TheCable, said on Sunday that over 100 other workers of the agency were also affected by the reorganisation. The Executive Chairman of the FIRS, Muhammad Nami, has reportedly approved the redeployment of top directors in the agency. “While some of the directors were said to have moved up in relevance and ranking, a senior official was sent out of the agency while a new director also joined the service,” the report stated.
