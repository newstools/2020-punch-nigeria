Johnny Edward Inter will demand fitness test results from Fenerbahce and Chelsea before signing former Nigeria international, Victor Moses. Antonio Conte is eager to land the 29-year-old this January transfer window to bolster his squad, but there are few problems already on the horizon. According to Corriere dello Sport, Conte wants extra fitness tests to ensure Moses is ready to go after suffering two serious thigh strains while playing for Fenerbahce. Moses enjoyed his most productive time at Chelsea under Conte, winning both the Premier League and the FA Cup while playing as a right wingback. He will return to Stamford Bridge at the end of the season, as he has struggled for game time in Turkey this season. Meanwhile, Chelsea are reportedly prepared to sell Moses for â‚¬10m even though Inter may only want him on loan. Moses has been previously sent out on loan to Liverpool, Stoke City and West Ham by the Blues. Copyright PUNCH.
