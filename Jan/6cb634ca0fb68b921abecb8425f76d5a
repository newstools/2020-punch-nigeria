Daud Olatunji The Federal Government has pleaded with residents of   border communities in Ogun State  to have  patience  following  the ban  on fuel supply to their areas. The Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution, which  is an agency under the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made the appeal at Agosasa in  Ipokia Local Government Area of the state on Saturday. A research fellow at IPCR, Charles  Okunlola, who addressed  the border community residents, said the agency had noted  their complaints over border closure. Okunola said  it  was  for the betterment of the nation’s economy. The FG last year suspended  the supply of petroleum products  to filling stations within 20 kilometres radius to all Nigerian borders. The people of the areas  have since been complaining that the policy is having adverse effect on them. Okunlola  said  the people should continue to be peaceful, even with security officers they  had accused of worsening the situation. He said the IPCR had gathered information from traditional rulers in the area, adding that  the report would be submitted to the appropriate authorities. He said, “Please continue to be patient and be peaceful. The people have really talked about the adverse effects the closure of the  border   are having on them, especially the ban on supply of petroleum products to border communities.” Copyright PUNCH.
