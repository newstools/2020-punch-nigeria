RB Leipzig’s extraordinary Champions League comeback against Benfica helped Sunday  Ehis win ₦2,431,430.45 with betPawa. The Edo resident needed the German team to avoid defeat in one of the final matches on his ₦3,000 betslip. They were losing 2-0 until two 90th-minute goals changed everything. He said: “I already gave up. Upon checking the score again, it was 1-2. Seeing that seven minutes was the added time, I had a bit of hope. Checking the final score and seeing 2-2, I broke my remote control out of excitement. “My wife-to-be was sleeping. When I found out that I have won the ticket, I screamed, trying to wake her up, but she was not answering me, so I moved to the next flat, telling my neighbours to come and celebrate with me.” Sunday’s initial winnings of ₦934,011.00 were increased to ₦2,431,430.45 by a 160% win bonus for betting on 26 legs. betPawa offer the best win bonus in Nigeria for all bets with three legs or more, including 250% for bets with 30 legs. “I will be getting married so some of the funds will come in handy,” he revealed.
