Olaide Oyelude, Katsina A man identified as Umar Faruk Funtua was, on Monday, shot dead by gunmen in Malumfashi, Katsina State. Funtua, who until his death was a lecturer at the Ahmadu Bello University School of Basic and Remedial Studies, Funtua, was said to be visiting a friend in Malumfashi when he was shot by the bandits. Sources in Malumfashi said the gunmen swooped on the town in search of a businessman with a view to kidnapping him. They reportedly attacked the residence of the businessman in the Kwandala area of Malumfashi. One of the sources said, “It was while they were trying to gain access to the businessman’s house that they started shooting sporadically, which resulted in the killing of the lecturer.” Funtua was said to have died on the spot, while his remains were later evacuated to the General Hospital, Malumfashi. The gunmen were also reported to have snatched mobile phones from some youths in the area before storming out of the town.
