He said, “As we rebuild the PDP for the challenges ahead, I urge you to give special positions to hard working youths that have done their best for the PDP.” Another commentator, Susan @SusanHenshaw50,  said, “No matter what this party does, it may want to consider not disrespecting Nigerians again, by putting its worst foot forward.
