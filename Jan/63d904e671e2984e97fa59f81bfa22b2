Ted Odogwu,  Kano The Federal Road Safety Corps, on Wednesday, confirmed that 12 persons lost their lives in a fatal auto crash on the Wudil-Maiduguri Road in the Gaya Local Government Area of Kano State. The accident occurred around 11.20am. The Public Relations Officer, Kano Sector Command, FRSC, Kabiru Daura, who confirmed the accident, said 26 persons made up of 19 male and five female adults, and nine male and five female children suffered varying degrees of injury. He said two commercial vehicles, a Volkswagen Golf and a Toyota Hiace bus with number plates BBR 690 AA and KTG 467 YG, respectively, were heading for Kano from Azare and Maiduguri from Kano with 38 passengers. An eyewitness told PUNCH Metro that the crash occurred at a road diversion in the Tsaida village, near Gaya. It was gathered that the vehicles had a head-on collision. Daura stated “The corpses of the victims and those who sustained injuries have been taken to the Gaya General Hospital. “Speed violation caused the accident. The drivers of both vehicles disregarded warning signs on road diversion, hence the head-on collision. “We have warned drivers on several occasions to avoid excessive speed and pay attention to warning signs, which they often neglect and which are the causes of numerous road accidents.” The Chairman, Gaya Local Government Area, Ahmed Abdullahi, who also confirmed the crash said, “The local government has already rendered support to the victims by facilitating their treatment.” Copyright PUNCH.
