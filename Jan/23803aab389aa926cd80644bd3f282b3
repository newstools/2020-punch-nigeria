Peter Dada, Akure No fewer than four naval ratings were killed by some youths suspected to be sea pirates in Gbagira village in the llaje Local Government Area of Ondo State. The men were killed while trying to rescue three foreigners from being abducted in the area. It was gathered that the suspected killers also went away with the four military rifles and seven magazines belonging to the killed naval ratings. A source said one of the sea pirates was apprehended in a suburb of Awoye community in the Ilaje Local Government Area. The source added that the suspected kidnappers, who eventually abducted the foreigners, came from Balyesa State. The Commanding Officer, Forward Operating Base in Igbokoda, Navy Commodore Danjuma Ndanusa, said he had directed community leaders to produce the stolen weapons of the deceased or face the wrath of law.
