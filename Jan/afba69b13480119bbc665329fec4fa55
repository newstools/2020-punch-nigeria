Prince Harry has arrived in Canada, where he is expected to spend most of his time after announcing his decision to “step back” from royal duties. Sky News and other media showed Harry leaving a plane as he arrived at Vancouver Airport early Tuesday. Harry’s wife, Meghan, and the couple’s eight-month-old son, Archie, returned to Canada earlier this month. Buckingham Palace announced on Saturday that Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, would “no longer (be) working members of the royal family”.
