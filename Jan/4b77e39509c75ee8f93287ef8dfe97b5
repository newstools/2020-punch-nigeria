Feyisayo Popoola Notore Chemicals Plc says it has secured a N13.2bn loan for equipment maintenance. The company said in a statement that the loan was secured from the African Export-Import Bank for the planned turnaround maintenance. It announced the commencement of the TAM of its plant, which it said was aimed at returning the plant to its 1,500MTPD and 500,000MTPA nameplate urea production capacity. It said it would also increase reliability index from the current level of 67 per cent to 95 per cent. According to the statement, following the drawdown of the N13.32bn loan facility from AFREXIM Bank, the company has started ordering all key components for the maintenance. It stated that the TAM project would include the procurement of critical spare parts required to sustain the nameplate capacity of the plant and installation of a back-up power supply to the current gas turbine generator. “Upon procurement of all the key components and critical spares required, the objective is to accomplish the maintenance activities within a period of 30-day production to production,” the statement added.
