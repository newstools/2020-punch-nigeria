Olaide Oyelude, Katsina. The Nigerian Army, mainly from the 17 Brigade, Katsina, on Wednesday launched attacks on bandits hideouts and camps in the forest in Jibia. The actions were still on as of press time. The spokesman for the Brigade, Captain Kayode Owolabi, confirmed the development, but could not give the precise figures of the bandits who had been neutralised, adding that the action was still on. The spokesman said, “For now we cannot confirm the number of bandits neutralised but we are hitting them.” He said two soldiers wounded in action had been moved to Katsina for treatment. Gunmen suspected to be bandits had earlier in the day abducted four Customs men at Dan- Bedi village. The bandits had also on Tuesday stormed a viewing centre in Magama Jibia, killing two viewers and injuring many. Copyright PUNCH.
