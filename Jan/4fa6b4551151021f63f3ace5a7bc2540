Nike Popoola The Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers has bemoaned the fire disaster that ravaged Akesan Market, (Oja Akesan) in the Oyo area of Oyo State, where properties worth millions of naira were destroyed. The council commended the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, for promising to provide succour for the victims of the incident, as well as provide fire-fighting equipment to forestall a reoccurrence of the ugly disaster. The President, NCRIB, Dr Bola Onigbogi, who stated this, decried the spate of fire disasters in the country, noting that such calamities were preventable. She used the forum to underscore the pivotal place of insurance in disaster management in the country. According to her, risks are part of the inevitable circumstances of life which can be better managed by engaging insurance as it is practised in advanced countries of the world. Onigbogi noted that to maximise the value of insurance, the best option for existing and potential clients was to engage the services of insurance brokers who would advise on best type and rate of insurance, as well as assist them to make their claims when a loss occurred. She called on government to fully embrace insurance for effective management and to assist the citizens by shifting the burden of compensation to insurers when losses occurred. Copyright PUNCH.
