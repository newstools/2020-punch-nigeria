Okechukwu Nnodim The Nigerian Meteorological Agency has announced an increase in the number of meteorological stations across the country by 103 outlets to ensure accurate rainfall prediction. NiMet’s Director-General, Prof. Sani Abubakar, who disclosed this in Abuja at a press briefing, stated that the increase was achieved through the installation of new meteorological equipment. He said the facilities were installed in partnership with relevant tertiary institutions, adding that the general upgrade of the equipment was with international collaboration. Mashi said, “We have witnessed an increase from 54 to over 157 meteorological stations.” He noted that the agency had received the ISO 9001:2015 for Aeronautical Meteorological Service Delivery, thereby becoming the first meteorological organisation in Africa to achieve this. Mashi said NiMet had also received the ISO 29990:2010 for training services at the regional training centre, Lagos. “On this, NiMet’s meteorological institution is the only institution in Africa and one of the seven in the world to have achieved this ISO certification,” he stated. The NiMet boss said the agency had established a new National Meteorological Training Institute in Katsina State for the training of Nigerians in meteorology at the National Diploma and Higher National Diploma levels.
