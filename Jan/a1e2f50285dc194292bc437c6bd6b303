Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government has inaugurated the National Gas Expansion Programme Committee to steer the gas sector for optimal performance and better utilisation of Nigeria’s abundant gas resources. The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who inaugurated the committee in Abuja, said the country was on the verge of becoming a gas hub for the African subregion. “We must make the industry relevant to the people by touching the lives of the ordinary citizens through equitable distribution of petroleum products in the country,” the minister stated. Sylva tasked members of the committee to work hard to achieve their mandates, adding that the team would serve as a catalyst for the development and  utilisation of available assets. He said they would ensure strict adherence to the National Gas Policy as gazetted and would reform and implement a market infrastructure strategy to promote cost-effective distribution. He said the committee would also engage state and non-state stakeholders on the gas policy. Sylva told the team that the programme if effectively implemented could reduce poverty and increase the per capita income of Nigerians. He therefore implored the committee to show utmost commitment in the discharge of its duties in the coordination of the programme. Chairman of the committee, Mohammed Ibrahim, promised the minister that his team would deliver on the mandates of the gas expansion programme. “We are aware of the task before us and the expectations. We shall hit the ground running to bring to bear our expertise to make the programme a success,” Ibrahim told Sylva. CopyrightPUNCH.
