Ihedioha, who was sacked by a Supreme Court judgment on Tuesday in Abuja, was reacting to a statement made by his successor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, who ordered a probe of three former governors of the state. The former governor, who spoke to our correspondent through his media aide, Chibuike Onyeukwu, said he was not tensed by Uzodinma’s probe order.
