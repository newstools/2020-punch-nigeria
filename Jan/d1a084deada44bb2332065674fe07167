Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will not call Liverpool the greatest team in Premier League history until they have the trophies to prove it. He still thinks that honour should be bestowed upon Alex Ferguson’s treble-winning United side in 1999. Solskjaer scored the dramatic late winner against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final that year to cap United’s incredible campaign. Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool are on course for a historic season of their own, holding a huge lead in the Premier League as they chase a first English league title since 1990. They remain in the FA Cup and face Atletico Madrid in the last 16 next month as they try to defend their Champions League crown. But Solskjaer believes Liverpool have to demonstrate the ability to keep winning year after year before they deserve to be ranked alongside United’s best outfits. “I would say our 1999 team was the best, but let’s see when the season has finished,” Solskjaer said. “That showed we as a squad could cope with three tournaments. It was an amazing season, an amazing group, the personalities, the camaraderie. “I’m sure Liverpool can win all three, so I’m not going to say yes or no, but let’s see in May. “You have to do it again and again and again and Sir Alex is the only manager who has won it three times. “He had an exceptional way of motivating us and getting us ready, a way of just letting trophies be trophies, win them and move forward.” AFP
