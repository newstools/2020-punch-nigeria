A middle-aged palm oil merchant in Umuahia, Mr Basil Odoemelam, who was robbed of over N1 million in broad day light, has died from gunshot wounds. News Agency of Nigeria  learnt that Odoemelam died around 6pm on Friday at the Federal Medical Center, Umuahia, where he was taken to after the attack. His business ally told NAN on the condition of anonymity that he gave up the ghost in the theatre, while doctors were carrying out a surgery to remove bullets that reportedly lodged in his lower abdomen. The gunmen were alleged to have shot him five times in the leg and lower abdomen before dispossessing him of the bag containing the money. The deceasedâ€™s younger brother, Ejima, who was seen weeping profusely at FMC, also confirmed the death to NAN. It will be recalled that a three-member armed gang on Thursday allegedly trailed the deceased from an old generation bank after he had reportedly withdrawn about N2 million to pay for goods supplied to him.
