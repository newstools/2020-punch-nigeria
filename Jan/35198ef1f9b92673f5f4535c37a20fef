Sola Shittu Benin The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has reaffirmed that he is not in government to impress anybody but to serve the Edo people. He noted that his administration will continue to put the interest of the ordinary Edo person first as the state develops. He stated this when he received executive members of the National Union of Printing, Publishing and Paper Products’ Workers (NUPPPPROW) Edo State Chapter, led by Comrade Queen Obaghagie, who paid a courtesy visit to the Government House, Benin City. Obaseki, who condemned neglect of government institutions by successive leaders, said that Edo people will remain the topmost priority of his administration. He said his administration is focused on training public servants at the John Odigie Oyegun Public Academy to make them useful to the service and the society after retirement. Obaseki said, “As a government, we are not here to impress anybody or group of people but very concerned about the future of the state and its people. “We will partner with some of the best institutions in the world to offer the best trainings around. It’s not another certificate-awarding institution but a place to enhance your life. Training and retraining are our focus.” The governor said there was something fundamentally wrong in any society where governments establish institutions and make an investment but they are neglected by successive leaders, noting that such a society wouldn’t experience rapid growth and development. “We must do things differently and ensure that what we are investing in survives, hence avoiding a repeat of past mistakes. The equipment we brought to the press has been paid for and partially financed and needs to be run for sustainability. “In 1968, that press was one of the best with state-of-the-art equipment but something went wrong; this must be fixed and all those involved should be held responsible. In 1968, we had less than 100 million people in this country but now it has doubled.
