China which has continued to increase its exports to Nigeria, and is now the biggest trading partner, however, not on the list of the top 10 countries Nigeria was exporting its products to in the first half of 2019. While China remains Nigeria’s biggest source of imports, India currently stands as the nation’s biggest export market. Major items imported from China include natural rubber, motorcycles and others. In April 2018, the Central Bank of Nigeria signed a Bilateral Currency Swap Agreement with the People’s Bank of China. By the end of 2018, the CBN disclosed that it had injected CNY669.66m in the foreign exchange market to support businesses trading with China. Worried about the trend, experts had said if something was not done to correct the negative trade balance trajectory between Nigeria and China, the gap would continue to widen. An export analyst and Chief Executive Officer, Multimix Group, Mr Obiora Madu, pointed out that China had commenced heavy export of services to Nigeria. Nigeria is home to numerous Chinese restaurants, for instance. Madu said, “The reason is that China is very aggressive with its exports. “It is so serious that if you go to the Chinese embassy to discuss business, you might come out with a proforma invoice. “Nigeria’s trade balance with China has been in the negative for years. Now, they have started exporting services to Nigeria. They are all over – construction, the new Dangote refinery, rail; you name it. “We could be in for colonisation.” He called on the Nigerian agency responsible for export matters to research and come up with a strategy to address the situation. He said Nigeria had a lot of goods to export to China including agricultural products and hardwood but added that strategy was needed. “We can even do without some of the items we are importing from China; we can produce them locally,” he said. Another export analyst and Lead Consultant, 3T Impex Trade, Mr Bamidele Ayemibo, advised Nigeria to look for products that could be exported to China and ship them to the country. Copyright PUNCH.
