Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Governor of Osun State, Adegboyega Oyetola, has charged security agents in the country to regard their jobs as a national call and service to humanity. He charged them to remain committed and continue to demonstrate a high level of integrity while discharging their duties. He spoke at the opening of a two-day ministerial strategy retreat in Ilesha, Oyo State, tagged, ‘Driving Performance in Achieving the Presidential Mandate on Nigeria’s Internal Security’, organised by the Ministry of Interior. Oyetola called on them to see their commitment to service as an act of rescuing the country from negative consequences of security negligence which could adversely affect all citizens, including their family members. He said, “A motivated staff is not likely to compromise his duty. Efforts must therefore be made to ensure that the welfare of staff is taken care of. “Security agents must regard their jobs as service to humanity and a national call. They must therefore approach their jobs with unbridled loyalty, integrity, commitment and hard work in the interest of the nation and posterity. “They must remember that service to the nation is service to themselves and their families as compromise can breed security breach whose consequences are better imagined.” Speaking earlier, the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, tasked the paramilitary agencies to look for strategies to curb security challenges facing the country. He enjoined them to articulate strategies that would promote collaboration and create the necessary synergy that would guarantee the safety and security in Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH.
