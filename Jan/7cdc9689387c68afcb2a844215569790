Zamfara State government has warned doctors and other health workers in the state to desist from absconding from their duty posts or face sanctions. The State Commissioner for Health, Alhaji Yahya Kanoma, issued the warning in Gusau on Tuesday while receiving members of Bungudu Emirate Council’s Hospital Committee who were on a courtesy visit. Kanoma expressed dismay with the attitude of some health workers in the State who abandon their duty stations, leaving patients unattended to.
