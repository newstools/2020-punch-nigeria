The Nigerian Ports Authority has raised the alarm, that residents of  Apapa are turning their properties into private jetties and terminals where they berth barges and evacuate cargoes. Managing Director of the NPA, Hadiza Bala-Usman, who raised the alarm at a stakeholders’ meeting organised by the Nigerian Shippers’ Council in Lagos recently,  said that  the agency had   done its investigations, identified these facilities and would soon descend on them with sanctions. Bala-Usman, who was represented by the Lagos Port Manager, Mrs Bola Olotu, said that virtually every building in Apapa had access to water and many of them were now handling containers and barges. According to her, NPA did not license any of the jetties to operate. “When we tried to gain access into some of these properties on Creek Road, we were attacked, we had to turn back, but I and my team, we were able to finish our investigation when we accessed the place through the waterways. “We have taken pictures and sanctions will be netted out soon.” she said Confirming the trend, the Chairman of Apapa Residents Association, Brigadier Ago Vaughan, said some businessmen in the commercial section of Apapa had bought properties in the Government Reserved Area and had converted them into private jetties and terminals handling trucks daily.
