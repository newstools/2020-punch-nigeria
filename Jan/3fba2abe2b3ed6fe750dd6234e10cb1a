Gbenga Adeniji Playwright and social critic, Prof Wole Soyinka, has advised those he said were sleeping all the while Nigerians were being killed to return to sleep, instead of tagging as illegal Operation Amotekun (leopard) initiated by the South-West governors to tackle insecurity in the region. The Western Nigeria Security Outfit codenamed Operation Amotekun was launched in Ibadan, Oyo State, last Thursday. But the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), declared the security task force as illegal on Tuesday. Speaking in Lagos on Wednesday, the Akogun of Isara traced his past concerns for sanity on roads through a memo to the then military governor of the Western State, Maj.-Gen. David Jemibewon (retd).

Owoeye Azazi (retd) including hosting the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, in his Abeokuta, Ogun State home on security matters. Soyinka stated that citizens have the right to defend themselves against attacks. He said,” Some people who have been sleeping all this time, taking belated actions, watching the people being decimated… and telling us that this initiative is illegal. They should go back to sleep. Amotekun has come to stay. ” He also urged the South-West governors to include Awosikun (think of how to feed the people of the region) after its laudable Amotekun initiative.
