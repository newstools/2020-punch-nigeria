Dele Ogunyemi, Warri Officers and men of the Safe Delta unit of the Nigeria Police Force, led by CSP Anietieh Eyoh, on Monday, arrested a notorious female armed robber, Bella Lucky, and two other members of a criminal gang at the McClivers Market area in Warri, Delta State. The robbery syndicate had been on the police wanted list and included two men and the trio presently in custody at the state police command headquarters in Asaba. Knives and mobile phones were recovered from the suspects by the police, who tracked Lucky down to a hideout after she allegedly stabbed and inflicted bodily injuries on a yet-to-be identified woman. Our correspondent gathered that the suspect specialised in luring her victims to the criminal gang said to be terrorising Warri and its environs in commercial tricycles. Confirming the arrest of members of the syndicate, the state Commissioner of Police, Hafiz Inuwa, told journalists in Warri, “Three of them were arrested. One of them is a very young woman. “These are armed robbers, who were using a woman. It’s not a question about notorious armed robbers, it is a gang using knives to stab people and rob them.” According to the police boss, the modus operandi of the syndicate is to use the female member “to sort of deceive passengers, engage them in a discussion until they get carried away and the members of the gang rob them.” “They’ve been arrested and they’re in our custody,” the CP stated. Inuwa was, however, silent on whether or not an armourer was among those arrested as he asked our correspondent to get in touch with the Commander of the Safe Delta, CSP Anietieh Eyoh, for more details. But, when contacted, Eyoh declined comments on the matter. Copyright PUNCH.
