Samson Folarin The Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Dr Wale Ahmed, on Tuesday asked workers in Lagos not to see him as a ruler, saying he was only a co-worker. He said he needed the cooperation of the civil servants to work effectively and support the goals of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Ahmed, who was the Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, was redeployed to the Ministry of Local Government and Community Affairs after a minor cabinet reshuffle by the governor last week. He was received into his new ministry by top officials and management staff, led by the Permanent Secretary, Dr Taiwo Salaam. The commissioner, who addressed the staff members, charged them to come up with new ideas that would impact residents. Ahmed assured all the stakeholders of the ministry, including traditional rulers and local government officials, of better service delivery. He promised to operate an open door policy, adding that his tenure would be all-inclusive with no one left behind. “My position here as the commissioner, is just by providence. By implication, there is nothing I cannot do without all of you here. Don’t see me as a ruler, but as a co-worker who is here to coordinate the activities of all of you and the ministry as a whole. “My humble plea is that let us design all our activities to align with the THEMES agenda of Governor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu’s administration and the onus is on you to make this agenda translate into programmes that will impact the life of Lagosians such that they can be able to relate with it,” Ahmed said.
