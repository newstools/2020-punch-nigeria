Olaide Oyelude, Katsina The police in Katsina State have shot dead two suspected bandits and rescued a 14-year-old-girl, Lantana Haruna, who was kidnapped 18 days ago. The spokesman for the state police command, SP Gambo Isah, said the incident occurred in the early hours of Thursday. Isah gave the names of the dead bandits as Gambo Balejo and Ali Dan Maishago. The rescued teenager was abducted at the Tashar Mai Alewa village in the Danmusa Local Government Area of the state. It was learnt that the Operation Puff Adder team, along with some repentant bandits, stormed the hideout of the bandits at the Jigawar Sawai forest, where the girl was being kept by her abductors and rescued her unhurt. The police team and the repentant bandits were said to have rescued Haruna after a fierce gun battle with the hoodlums. Isah said, “Today, Thursday, January 9, 2020, around 10am, a joint rescue operation conducted by the Operation Puff Adder in collaboration with repentant bandits at the Danmusa LGA of Katsina State succeeded in rescuing one Lantana Haruna, 14, of the Madawa village, Danmusa LGA of Katsina State. “The victim was kidnapped 18 days ago at the Tashar Mai Alewa village, Danmusa LGA of Katsina State. After a fierce gun duel with her captors in their hideout at the Jigawar Sawai forest, the team succeeded not only in rescuing the victim, but in killing two of the notorious bandits terrorising the area. Those killed are Gambo Balejo and Ali Dan Maishago.” He added that investigation into the crime was still ongoing. Copyright PUNCH.
