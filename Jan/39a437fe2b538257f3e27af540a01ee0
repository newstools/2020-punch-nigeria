The Edo State Skills Development Agency also known as EdoJobs in collaboration with the Industrial Training Fund, Oxfam, Siemens, Market Development in Niger Delta and Coven Labs has trained and empowered 29,269 youths across the 18 Local Government Areas of Edo State. The Managing Director of EdoJobs, Mrs Ukinebo Dare, was quoted to have disclosed this to journalists in Benin City. A statement by the agency quoted Dare as saying EdoJobs was looking to surpass Governor Godwin Obaseki’s promise to create 200,000 jobs at the end of his first term in office. She said the youths were trained on various skills including solar system design and installation, digital skills and marketing, web design and graphics and phones and laptop repairs. Other areas included automobile engineering, POP tiling and paint production, fashion and beauty and food production and sales. According to Dare, some of the start-ups at the Edo Innovation Hub and the Edo Production Centre also got seed support to the tune of N50m from the different partners. Other partnering organisations are Slot Foundation, Micliz Paint Industry Ltd, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbei otherwise known as GIZ and the Genius Hub Global, among others.
