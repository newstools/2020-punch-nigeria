Tony Okafor, Awka The All Progressives Congress in Anambra State has described political parties that will contest against it during the 2021 governorship poll in the state as midgets. It boasted that the election would be a walkover, stressing that it had long prepared to take over the state. The All Progressives Grand Alliance has been ruling the state since 2006, while the Peoples Democratic Party has remained the major opposition party. But on Thursday, the state chairman of the APC, Chief Basil Ejidike, said the party had long prepared itself to defeat other contenders in 2021. Ejidike, who spoke to journalists in Awka, the state capital, said with APGA’s poor performance and the rejection of the PDP in the state, the APC was the party to beat. He said he had been working round the clock with members of the State Working Committee and other stakeholders to ensure victory at the poll. He said, “I am quite upbeat about the chances of the APC in Anambra State come 2021. I am just coming from the solidarity rally held for our national chairman in Edo State and I even addressed the crowd that gathered there. “I am quite upbeat because we are the party on the ground and we have our sensors connected to the pulses of the people. “We feel their pain owing to the failings of successive governments in the state. “APGA has indeed failed, the PDP isn’t prepared for leadership and so it behoves us in the APC to begin to present our ideas and agenda to the people in order to win them over; and that we have reasonably done.” Copyright PUNCH.
