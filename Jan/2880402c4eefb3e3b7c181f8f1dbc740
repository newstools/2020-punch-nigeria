Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The governorship candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement in the last election in Ogun State, Adekunle Akinlade, has said he will still be called the governor of Ogun State, someday. Akinlade expressed the optimism on Tuesday during a reception organised for him by the All Progressives Congress in his ward at Agosasa, in the Ipokia Local Government Area of Ogun State. Akinlade was received by the Chairman of the APC in the Local Government Area, Mr Michael Olalowo, the Agosasa Ward Leader, Falade Soliu, and members of Ipokia pioneer led by Ashirudeen Maliki. He stressed that he and his supporters from the APM had no grudges against the leadership of the APC. Akinlade claimed that he campaigned openly for the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in the last presidential election. He also insisted that he and his supporters never left the APC but decided to fight for justice under the APM. Akinlade maintained that his ambition in the 2019 governorship election was to continue the Mission to Rebuild Ogun State from where the Ibikunle Amosun-led administration stopped.
