Leke Baiyewu, Abuja A member of the 8th Senate, Senator Sam Anyanwu, has faulted Buhari’s allegation that the immediate past National Assembly deliberately frustrated his regime by delaying budget approvals. Anyanwu, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party who represented Imo East Senatorial District, blamed the executive for delaying the appropriation bill presentation as well as non-cooperation by the Federal Government’s ministry, department and agencies. The former lawmaker said, “Unfortunately, I don’t know if Mr President knows what he is talking about. “We don’t prepare budgets. The budget is to be presented by the executive. So, if there is any delay in the approval of any budget, it is from the executive, it was not from us.” READ ALSO: Akeredolu plans to settle herdsmen in Ondo – PDP When reminded that the 2019 budget actually spent seven months with the National Assembly, Anyanwu said, “Do you know that even after we left (May 2019) some of the agencies had yet to bring their budgets and expenditures for approval?” Copyright PUNCH.
