Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri Maiduguri residents have lamented the closure of  the Maiduguri-Damaturu  Expressway  following  Boko Haram attacks in Borno State. Gunfights between troops and Boko Haram  on the  expressway  have become a regular affair these days, causing panic in the city. There have  also been a  series of  abductions on the road, forcing   the United Nations and international non-governmental organisations to stop their workers from travelling to Maiduguri by road. The military, before the latest confrontation with Boko Haram  fighters on the road,  complained that two villages along  the highway, Jakana and Mainok,  were inhabited by insurgents and their families. According to the military, Boko Haram fighters  always launch their attacks from the villages. The military said they decided to   close the  road to  prevent  motorists and passengers   from being  caught in the middle of a shoot-out. Some of the  drivers, who spoke to our correspondent on Monday, said many people had been stranded since Sunday when  Boko Haram insurgents  attacked communities along the  road. A Maiduguri resident lamented that many people had been unable to come into the city since the road was closed. Another  resident of Maiduguri, Abubakar Idris, who travelled to  Damaturu on  Sunday with a plan to return the same day,  said, “I was supposed to return to Maiduguri but I have been stranded alongside many others in Damaturu, because no vehicle is allowed to travel on the Maiduguri-Damaturu Expressway.” Attempt to reach  spokesman  for  the  Nigerian Army Col Sagir Musa for comments  were  not successful as of  the time of filing this report.
