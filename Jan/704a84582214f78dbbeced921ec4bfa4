Ife Ogunfuwa Jumia Group says it is relying on the increased usage of its payment platform, Jumia Pay, to drive business growth in Nigeria. The Jumia Group’s co-CEO and Co-Founder, Jeremy Hodara, said the e-commerce company expected growth and profitability in 2020 would be made possible by incentivising the usage of the platform. Hodara said these while sharing the company’s vision for the 2020 at a press conference in Lagos on Wednesday. The co-founder also announced the replacement of the Jumia Nigeria Chief Executive Officer, Juliet Anammah. He named Massimiliano Spalazzi as the new Jumia Nigeria CEO, saying Spalazzi had served as CEO for Jumia Emerging countries between January 2015 and January 2019 and CEO Jumia Market from January 2015  to September 2017. The e-commerce company had faced turbulent times on the continent last year, reportedly leading to the shutting of Jumia Travel in Nigeria and Jumia Food in Rwanda. The company also closed its entire operations in Cameroon and Tanzania, citing low performance in those markets. Speaking on the challenges experienced in 2019, Hodara stated that Jumia had grown stronger. “We tried many opportunities and strategies. We take a lot of time to invest in lot of things we do. Challenges are the ability to grow new talents and sustain the business. “Jumia is not positioned to be the only e-commerce company but to be the best in the space. Jumia is pledging to continuously improve so as to satisfy our customers and explore the e-commerce potential. We are here to stay,” he said. Copyright PUNCH.
