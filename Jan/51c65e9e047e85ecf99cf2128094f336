Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State, Emma Chinda, said the peace meeting held by some stakeholders of the party on Sunday was not in the interest of the leader of the party, Rotimi Amaechi, and the leader of another faction of the party, Senator Magnus Abe. Recall that there was a heated argument during the closed-door meeting convened by one of the stakeholders of the state chapter of the APC, Emmanuel Deeya. Speaking in a telephone interview with our correspondent on Monday, Chinda explained that the meeting was suddenly turned to a platform to insult Amaechi. Chinda pointed out that the argument became heated because those in Amaechi’s faction of the party made moves to stop those insulting the leader of the party in the state. He said, “The noise you heard in the meeting was because we do not believe in some of the positions being canvassed in meeting. “The positions being canvassed there will not serve the interest of those who they say are with the leader of the party (Rotimi Amaechi), which I am one. It does not serve the interest of those who they say are with Senator Magnus Abe. “Only those who convened the meeting will tell us the interest, which this meeting is to serve. Some of us said if they wanted to make peace in the party, the national secretariat of the party must be a critical stakeholder, the leader of the party in the state (Amaechi) and Senator Magnus Abe must be critical stakeholders.” Copyright PUNCH.
