Maiharaji Altine, Gusau The Chairman of the Kaura-Namoda Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Alhaji Lawal Maibindiga, is currently at loggerheads with the local government’s councillors over his defection to the ruling Peoples Democratic Party from the All Progressives Congress. Maibindiga defected to the ruling PDP without the councillors who chose to remain in the APC. Apart from the councillors, all the ward chairmen of the APC have also refused to defect with the council’s chairman, a situation that has stalled activities in the local government. Addressing journalists at an emergency meeting at the state secretariat of the party on Thursday, the councillors maintained that they would remain in the APC despite the chairman’s defection. Speaking to our correspondent immediately after the meeting, a councillor representing 11 others, Kasimu Danajiji, said, “The defected chairman will regret his action.” He said the councillors would call an emergency meeting in order to study the situation and possibly take steps to remove the chairman from office. He called on the chairman to resign honourably or be sacked. “No local government chairman can rule without his councillors. He should have contacted us before defecting to the PDP,” he said. Also speaking earlier, the state APC Vice-Chairman, Alhaji Musa Mallaha, advised the chairman to vacate his seat. Copyright PUNCH.
