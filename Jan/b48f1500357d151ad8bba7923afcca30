Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Police Special Fraud Unit in Ikoyi has launched an investigation into a visa fraud targeted at the Taiwanese Trade Office in Lagos. It was gathered that the investigation was sequel to a complaint addressed to the SFU Commissioner of Police by the trade office about the new trend adopted by fraudsters in obtaining money from unsuspecting members of the public under the pretext of helping them to procure Taiwanese e-visa. PUNCH Metro learnt that the fraudsters obtain $350 from each applicant for the issuance of the fake e-visa. The Taiwanese embassy in Nigeria, in the letter of complaint to the SFU, stated that it was not issuing electronic tourist visa to Nigerians and was not charging the sum of $350 for its visa. According to the letter of complaint, the Taiwanese tourist visa costs $50 and the application must be done in person at the Taiwan Trade Office in Lagos. The Public Relations Officer, SFU, Eyitayo Johnson, who stated that the investigation was being carried out by the Diplomatic Unit of the SFU, added that it was necessary to prevent more unsuspecting members of the public from falling victim of the fraud. Eyitayo, who added that the principle of seeing something and saying something was better for a safer society, urged members of the public, who had information about the activities of the fraudsters, to report to the unit.
