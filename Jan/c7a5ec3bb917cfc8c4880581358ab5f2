Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Government said  on Monday that  the Dr Olusegun Mimiko-led Peoples Democratic Party  administration left N220bn debt at the end of its tenure in 2016. The  All Progressives Congress administration in the state  however said it had reduced the debt by 50 per cent . The state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Donald Ojogo, stated this while featuring on a Channels Television programme on Monday. Ojogo said  the current administration in the state had also jerked up the Internally Generated Revenue from the N700m it inherited from the PDP administration to over N1bn monthly. He said Akeredolu’s administration signed a pact with the people of the state to ensure an all-round development in the three senatorial districts of the state. He also explained that the N30bn bond which the state sought  to raise  would be used in line with extant financial provisions. He said, “Our resolve as a government is that by the time we leave office in the next five years, I said in the next five years because Mr Governor is going to recontest and win by God’s grace, we hope to leave the government without debt for the incoming administration after our two terms. “The PDP will not deny the fact that we are constructing a flyover in Ore, we have levelled up a hill in Ikare and made it a dual carriage way, we are changing the face of Akure with massive infrastructure.” Copyright PUNCH.
