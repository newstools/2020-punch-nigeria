Sola Shittu, Benin The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday instructed the state Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs to commence criminal prosecution of council chairmen who were relieved of their positions over corruption allegations. The governor said this at the inauguration of the new Chairman of the Esan West Local Government Area, Mrs Ruth Osahon, at the Government House in Benin City. He said his administration would not turn a blind eye to corrupt practices at the local council level. “We have seen a trend where a few local council chairmen have not lived up to expectations. As a government that is people-focused and has made a promise to the people, we will not be afraid to take the right decisions where necessary,” the governor said. Obaseki urged the new council chairman to cooperate with relevant authorities as they carry-out investigation into the records of the sacked chairman of the council, Patrick Aguinede. He charged Osahon to ensure payment of salary arrears owed the council workers within 12 months. Osahon thanked the governor for the opportunity to serve and promised not to let him down.
