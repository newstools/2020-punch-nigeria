Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi Air Peace has said, in line with its expansion drive, it has commenced flights from Abuja to Warri, Delta State. The airline’s Corporate Communications Executive, Stanley Olisa, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday, adding that it was part of the vision to provide seamless connections to Nigerians. Olisa said the Abuja-Warri-Abuja flight would be operated daily. According to him, Air Peace started the new connection in response to requests from Nigerians asking for flight connections between both cities. He said, “Air Peace is determined to interconnect every part of Nigeria. It is our own way of uniting our nation and promoting healthy socio-economic exchanges between different cities. “The airline has new local and international routes in the offing such as Ilorin, Makurdi, Ibadan, Congo DRC, Congo Brazzaville, Douala in Cameroon and Johannesburg, South Africa.” Olisa said the airline’s ‘no-city-left-behind’ initiative had been driving its rapid route expansion.
