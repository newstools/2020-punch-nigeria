James Abraham, Jos A Plateau State High Court will on January 21, 2020, resume the trial of a former governor of the state, Jonah Jang. The PUNCH had reported that the state Chief Judge had reassigned the case to a new judge, Justice Christy Dabup. This was after Justice Daniel Longji, who had been handling the matter since March 2018, retired last week. A principal counsel in the Plateau State Ministry of Justice, Mr Gideon Azi, who is also holding brief for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in the case, confirmed the new hearing date to our correspondent in Jos on Wednesday. Azi said, “The new judge, Justice Christy Dabup, who has been assigned by the Chief Judge of the state to take over the case has fixed January 21,2020 to continue with the trial. “The new date is for mention. What this means is that the trial of the former governor and his co-accused persons, will start afresh. “Since we are on the side of the prosecution, we are making efforts to ensure that counsel for the two defendants are served with the notice on the new date.” Jang is facing trial alongside a former cashier in the office of the Secretary to the Plateau State Government, Mr Yusuf Pam, as first and second defendants, respectively. They were arraigned on 17 amended charges by the EFCC bordering on alleged misappropriation of fund and criminal breach of trust between 2007 and 2015. The duo had pleaded not guilty to the charges.
