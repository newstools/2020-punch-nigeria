Sola Shittu, Benin The Deputy Governor of Edo State, Mr Philip Shaibu, on Wednesday reassured the people of the state that despite the gimmicks of detractors, the multi-sectoral progress and development witnessed across the 18 local government areas of the state, would not be put on reverse gear. Shaibu, who spoke with journalists in Benin City, the Edo State capital, said the state government would continue to stand for the collective interest of Edo people by upholding their trust. Describing the governor as a leader who has redefined governance in the state, Shaibu promised that the Godwin Obaseki-led administration would not relent in building infrastructure and enacting policies that would facilitate the emergence of a productive and vibrant economy in the state. The deputy governor while thanking Edo people for the confidence and encouragement shown to the Obaseki-led state government, urged them to join hands with the government in consolidating ongoing transformational achievements in the state. He said, “This is the time for Edo people to choose if we want progress; our progress must not be put in reverse. “Some persons want to stop Edo State from progressing but this is the time to defend Governor Obaseki and Edo people.” Copyright PUNCH.
