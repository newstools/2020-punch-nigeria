Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri A High Court in Owerri on Tuesday issued an interim order barring the suspended Imo State local government areas’ chairmen and councillors from resuming in the 27 LGAs of the state. The verdict was declared despite the fact that the suspended chairmen and councillors refused to appear in court or send any representative. Justice Eze Njemanze issued the order following an application for an interim order filed by the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in the state, Ndukwe Nnawuchi. The Attorney-General said the suspended chairmen and councillors, having filed numerous suits in court challenging their suspension, should have waited for the outcome of their suits instead of seeking to take over government by “brute force.” Nnawuchi said, “A situation where a case is pending in court and the defendants decided to take up weapons and overrun the 27 council areas in Imo State, is an affront on the legal authority of the court. It would portray the court as a toothless bulldog if such recklessness was condoned. “It is also criminal and treasonable felony, to take over government by force without the backing or force of law.” He said such an action if allowed, would be a recipe for anarchy because the state would be seen as a place where only the strong and mighty survived without any recourse to law and order. The judge said that all the parties in the suit were duly served and were aware that the substantive suit HOW/613/2019, was pending before the Court. He pointed out that the defendants ignored the pendency of the suit and tried to force their way into the 27 LGAs on Monday. CopyrightPUNCH.
