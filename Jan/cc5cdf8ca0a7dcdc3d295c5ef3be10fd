Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt A factional leader of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, Fegalo Nsuke, has accused operatives of the Inspector-General of Police Special Tactical Squad of handcuffing his hands to the burglar-proof of a window till daybreak. Nsuke was arrested on January 2, 2020, by the IGP STS with his hands cuffed to his back and taken to several police stations before he was released two days after. Narrating his ordeal to Southern City News in a telephone chat on Wednesday, Nsuke said he was arrested and treated like a common criminal, adding that his ordeal had to do with the MOSOP leadership tussle. He stated, “I was detained there in handcuffs. I slept there with my hands chained to the burglar-proof that was by the window. My hands were hung up there till the following morning. “That morning, they took me in a van and drove me to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad at Rukpokwu in Port Harcourt. I was detained inside a heavily populated cell. READ ALSO: Policeman slit my throat after knocking me down – Man “I was detained in the cell where kidnappers and armed robbers were kept.

I slept on the bare floor without tiles. It was a complete torture chamber. Copyright PUNCH.
