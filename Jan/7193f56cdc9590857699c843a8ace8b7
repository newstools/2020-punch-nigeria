Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The police in Abuja have arrested two suspects for allegedly robbing a hotel in the Jahi area of the Federal Capital Territory. The suspects, Udume Gideon, 23, and Daniel Ngwuoke, 23, were arrested at their hideout in Mararaba, Nasarawa State, on December 20, 2019, by police operatives. Parading the suspects in Abuja on Tuesday, the Commissioner of Police, FCT Command, Bala Ciroma, said a locally-made pistol and one unexpended cartridge were recovered from them. In another development, the police have also nabbed one Ehiosu Kennedy, 26, for allegedly stealing a car at gunpoint. Ciroma stated, “On December 5, 2019, following an ongoing investigation into a reported case of a car snatched at gunpoint around the Kabusa junction, operatives of the command’s Special Anti-Robbery Squad arrested one Ehiosu Kennedy at his hideout in Benin, Edo State, in connection with the crime. “Sequel to his confession, one Ibrahim Umar, 29, whom he identified as his cohort, was arrested at his hideout in Ruga in possession of the firearm used for the operation.” The command added that further investigation led to the smashing of another notorious gang terrorising the Life Camp-Lugbe area of Abuja. Those in custody are Umar Abdullahi, 25; Mohammed Rabi, 23; Zakari Abdullahi, 23; and Aminu Sani, 21. According to the police, exhibits recovered from the gang include one AK-47 rifle, cutlass and a pair of garden scissors. Copyright PUNCH.
