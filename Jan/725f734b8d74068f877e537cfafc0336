Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission on Wednesday met with political party officials and security operatives over the scheduled rerun of the Kagarko and Sanga local government areas of Kaduna State. The Court of Appeal in Kaduna had in November last year sacked  two state House of Assembly members and ordered  that a rerun be conducted by INEC to determine who would  represent Kagarko and Sanga constituencies in the state assembly. Meanwhile, at the meeting held at the INEC office in Ungwan Rimi, Kaduna on Wednesday, the state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Abdullahi Kaigama, said the commission was set for the election slated for January 25. The commissioner, who was represented by the Administrative Secretary of the commission, Muhammed Auwal, gave the assurance at a meeting of the Stakeholders Election Committee Forum. He said the elections would be conducted in 36 polling units, where a total of 34,315 eligible voters would be expected to cast their votes. He said all the non-sensitive materials were already on ground and that the money required to execute the exercise had been released. He explained that only serving National Youths Service Corps members would be used in the lower cadre, while INEC workers would be deployed as Supervising Presiding Officers and others.
