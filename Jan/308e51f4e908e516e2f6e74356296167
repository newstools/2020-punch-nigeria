Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The National Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs has expressed shock over the killing of the Christian Association of Nigeria chairman in Michika Local Government Area of Adamawa State, Pastor Lawan Andimi, by Boko Haram. The council described the murder as barbaric and provocative, adding that it was a ploy by the insurgents to incite Christians against Muslims in the country. Andimi was abducted by Boko Haram on January 3 and subsequently killed on Monday despite being offered a N50 million ransom. The NSCIA in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday, by its Head of Media and Communication, Aselemi Ibrahim, condoled with CAN and the family of the deceased and also called on the Federal Government and the security agencies to be alive to their responsibilities of protection of lives and property.
