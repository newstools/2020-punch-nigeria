Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Nigerian Air Force has commenced the second phase of Operation Rattle Snake, killing scores of the Boko Haram terrorists during an encounter in the Abulam area of northern Borno State on New Year Eve. The NAF had held the first leg of Rattle Snake in the second week of December 2019, and now begun the second phase, noting that it is aimed at bombing “identified insurgent camps and logistics to diminish their fighting capability.” According to a release on Wednesday, the NAF said Abullam was selected for attack on the first day of the operation based on reports that the terrorists were using the settlement as a staging point to attack troops. The NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said, “Accordingly, the Air Task Force detailed its attack aircraft, supported by an Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance aircraft, to attack designated compounds within the settlement. “The jets took turns to engage the target in successive passes leading to the destruction of some of the structures as well as the killing of several terrorists.”
