Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Imo State Police Command has beefed up security in the state ahead of the Supreme Court’s judgment on the state governorship legal tussle slated for Tuesday (today). The command’s Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu, disclosed this in a statement on Monday. He said all security agencies in the state were working together to ensure that there was no breakdown of law and order before, during or after the apex court’s verdict. Ikeokwu said, “In view of the Supreme Court’s judgment on the Imo State governorship election, which is scheduled to hold on Tuesday, the Imo State Police Command in conjunction with other security agencies in the state wish to express its readiness to ensure safety and security of members of the public during and after the judgment. “The command therefore warns all the parties involved to maintain decorum before, during and after the judgment. “It further advises whichever party that comes out victorious to be responsible and respect other people’s rights while jubilating and celebrating, and not to use such medium to foment trouble or conduct themselves in a manner that could cause breach of the public peace. “Similarly, the command warned whichever party that loses to also be peaceful and maintain decorum, as the loss will afford the said party to reflect, restrategise and prepare for the next election.” Copyright PUNCH.
