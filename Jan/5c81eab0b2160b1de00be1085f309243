Success Nwogu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party on Thursday condemned the demolition of a property by the Kwara State government. The property called ‘Ile Arugbo’ belonged to a former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki. The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement described the demolition as baseless. He said, “The PDP dismisses the reasons being spewed by the APC administration for this New Year’s dastard act as baseless, false and incongruous, as they fail to add up, to justify the ferocious invasion, harassment of citizens and demolition of the said property.

He said the timing of the demolition, in the wee hours and under the cover of darkness, was a direct indication that the State government was allegedly carrying out an unwholesome act. Ologbondiyan said, “Nigerians should note that the demolition of property, genuinely belonging to opposition leaders and other Nigerians perceived to be opposed to APC’s oppressive administration, has become a policy of the APC and its government in their bid to subjugate Nigerians and exclusively appropriate our common patrimony for their selfish purposes. “Nigerians have not forgotten how APC leaders, including those at the Presidency, applauded whenever property belonging to perceived political opponents was unjustly and viciously pulled down in APC-controlled states and even in Abuja,” he stated.
