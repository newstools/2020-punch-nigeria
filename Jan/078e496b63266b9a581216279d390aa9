Success Nwogu, Abuja The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, has said that the party leadership has started to address the allegation against the Governor of Ebonyi State, Mr David Umahi, and a member of the PDP Board of Trustees, Daisy Danjuma, that recently endorsed the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, of the All Progressives Congress for a second term. Secondus, in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja on Thursday, said the party’s leadership was looking into the issue. “We are looking into it. No comment,” he simply said. Danjuma, wife of a former Minister of Defence, Theophilus Danjuma, had reportedly defended her endorsement of  Obaseki as a personal decision. She was quoted as saying, “I owe nobody apology for endorsing the second term aspiration of Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo. I have the right to support whoever I choose to. I am a member of the PDP. I have never left the PDP or defected to any party like others. It is my right to free comment and I have exercised that.” READ ALSO: Edo absentee lawmakers-elect ask Buhari, Tinubu to caution Obaseki Umahi, who reportedly endorsed Obaseki, had come under attack from the leadership of the Edo State chapter of the PDP.
