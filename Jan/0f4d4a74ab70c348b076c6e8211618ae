ABIODUN NEJO Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has unveiled plans by his administration to build a recreational and wellness centre with modern facilities for senior citizens in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. Fayemi said the idea of building an elderly people’s resort and wellness centre was borne out of respect for the aged and as well the counsel of the Ekiti Council of Elders. The governor made the disclosure in Ado Ekiti during a special send-forth reception in honour of two retired heads of service and 42 permanent secretaries, who retired from the state public service between 2012 and 2019. He said, “Let me use this opportunity to restate the determination of the present administration to make the welfare of all the senior citizens in the state a priority, through prompt payment of their gratuities and pensions. “Equally, based on our respect for elders and the wise counsel of the Ekiti Council of Elders, we are building a recreational Elderly People’s Resort and Wellness Centre in Ado Ekiti.” He explained that the ceremony was organised to ensure that the retirees did not miss out of the usual honour of being celebrated after leaving the service. Fayemi praised them for reaching the height of their career, saying the legacy of hard work and commitment they left behind had made it possible for the state public service to evolve and adapt to changing realities and global best practice in service delivery. He said, “I warmly congratulate the senior citizens on their retirement from the public service after meritorious services to our dear state. I equally congratulate you for reaching the enviable positions of PS and HoS in Ekiti State Public Service.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
