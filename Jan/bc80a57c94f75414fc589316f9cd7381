Samson Folarin The Oxford English Dictionary on Tuesday admitted 29 Nigerian words and expressions in its January updates to the dictionary. The dictionary, in its monthly update on its blog, said Nigerians had continued to make distinctive contribution to English as a global language. The post explained that majority of the new additions were either borrowings from Nigerian languages or unique Nigerian coinages that had begun to be used in English in the second half of the 20th century, especially in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the words included buka, mama put, danfo, okada, agric and ember months. “Also coming from pidgin contexts is the verb chop, which is a common colloquial word in Ghana and Nigeria meaning ‘to eat’. However, beginning in the 1970s, chop also developed the sense of acquiring money quickly and easily, and often dishonestly. “The negative sense of misappropriating, extorting, or embezzling funds is also in the earlier reduplicative noun chop-chop (earliest quotation dated 1966), which refers to bribery and corruption in public life. This likening of stealing money to actually devouring it is also reflected in the even earlier synonymous phrase to eat money (1960)….” the post stated. All the new Nigerian words added are agric, barbing salon, buka, bukateria, chop, chop-chop, danfo, to eat money, ember months, flag-off, to flag-off, gist (n), gist (v), guber, Kannywood, K-leg, mama put, next tomorrow, non-indigene, okada, to put to bed, qualitative, to rub minds, sef, send-forth, severally, tokunbo, zone and zoning.
