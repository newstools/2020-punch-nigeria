Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed has ordered the suspension  of the  caretaker committee chairman of Ningi Local Government Area, Nura Dan-Maishari’a,  over his  alleged high-handedness and inability to stop indiscriminate felling of trees in  the council. The suspension was contained in a statement  by the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Sabiu Baba, on Thursday. Baba  said, “Government has observed with dismay your lackadaisical attitude towards running the affairs of the LGA. The way  you have frequently  been absconding from meetings of local government chairmen convened by the Ministry for Local Government Affairs is a dereliction of responsibility. “Similarly, the LGA  is witnessing indiscriminate felling of trees under your watch, which is inimical to the avowed commitment of the present administration  to  combating desertification and environmental issues.” The state government also  said  Dan-Maishari’a refused to engage stakeholders in the LGA in managing the affairs of the council in violation of  the principles of representative government. Baba  said  the suspension was  aimed at ensuring a  proper investigation into the allegations levelled Dan-Maishari’a. Copyright PUNCH.
