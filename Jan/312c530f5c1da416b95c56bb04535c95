Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo One Olalere Bakare has been arraigned before an Osun State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Osogbo for failure to procure Swiss visa and tickets for two applicants after he allegedly obtained the sum of N780,000 from them. The 52-year-old Bakare was said to have failed to fulfil his promise to Demilade Adetuberu and Funmilayo Adewuyi after collecting money from them. Bakare was said to have fraudulently obtained N253,000 from  Adetuberu and N527,000 from Adewuyi on the pretext that he would procure Switzerland visa and tickets for them and was charge with five counts bordering on conspiracy, false pretences, fraud and stealing. The offences were allegedly committed in August 2019 at the Captain Cook area of Osogbo. Bakare, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. His counsel, S. O. Abiona, urged the court to admitt to bail and the police prosecutor, Abiodun Fagboyinbo, did not oppose the bail application. Magistrate Risikat Olayemi, in her ruling, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N500,000 and one surety in like sum. She adjourned the case till February 12, 2020, for hearing. Copyright PUNCH.
