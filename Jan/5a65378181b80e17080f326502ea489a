Wale Oyewale, Ibadan Former Oyo State governor Abiola Ajimobi has urged Nigerians not to lose hope in the ability of the regime of Major General Muhammadu (retd.) to fix the economy. Ajimobi also urged members of the All Progressives Congress in Oyo State to embrace true reconciliation in the interest of the party. The ex-governor said these in his New Year’s Day message in a statement   by his media aide Bolaji Tunji. He said,  “The (Buhari) administration has set the tone for the revamping of the economy through various policies and projects. “I want to assure all Nigerians that the love of the nation burns brightly in the heart of the President and he is determined to ensure that a legacy that would stand the test of time is  in place in the country. “We have seen some of the giant strides of the administration in  the areas of infrastructure. Roads are being constructed across the country, rail lines are also being laid. These are ways of further opening up the economy. “The administration needs our  support. As a great leader, it is about taking the people to where they ought to be and not where they want to be. It may look difficult now but we shall all smile at the end of the day.” On the crisis in the APC in the state Ajumobi said, “Our reconciliation is ongoing and positive steps had been taken. We should eschew the bitterness of the past and forgive. “Some people had offended me and I had offended some people too. But in the spirit of true reconciliation, we should forgive one another and allow the past to end with 2019.” Copyright PUNCH.
