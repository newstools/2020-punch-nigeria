Inter Milan officials have held talks with Olivier Giroud’s agents and agreed to terms for a January transfer. Sky in Italy is reporting that the France striker, whose Blues deal expires in the summer, has agreed to a two-and-a-half-year contract to join the Italian side. However, Inter have yet to agree to a deal with Chelsea, who are asking for between £6.8m (€8m) and £8.5m (€10m). Inter do not want to spend more than £4.3m (€5m) – and Giroud has other offers on the table, including from Lyon, but he is keen to move to Inter. Aston Villa had made an approach to sign Giroud on loan earlier this month.
