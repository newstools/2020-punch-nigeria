Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Monday described his newly-composed State Executive Council as the most star-studded council in Nigeria. Abiodun stated this in his office during an orientation organised for the new commissioners and special advisers. The governor told his cabinet members to brace themselves for the challenges of their new offices, warning them that they were under public scrutiny. He said, “This administration is arguably the most star-studded cabinet in the country. Various expertise, different backgrounds and even varying but complementary flavours have been brought together. “As the captain of this team, I want to assure you that I will provide the right leadership for you to blossom as individual stars and for our team to record achievements that are greater than the sum of individual accomplishments.” The governor said the commissioners would come under intense public scrutiny as people would want to probe their action and inaction.
