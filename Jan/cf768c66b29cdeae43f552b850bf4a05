Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, has advised the incoming administration of the state governor-elect, Mr David Lyon, and his team to get ready to tackle head-on the developmental challenges facing the state. He said there was plenty of work to do in the state, stressing that governance was not all about “cheap talk, propaganda and blackmail.” He said it was about striving to add value to the development of the state. Dickson spoke in Yenagoa at the weekend while explaining reasons his administration converted a governor’s residence he would have stayed for eight years, to a five-star hotel and also established a golf course and a polo club to complement the hotel. He said, “In Bayelsa, we are leading a deliberate development effort of a deprived and underdeveloped area at a difficult financial period and I’ve tried my best, despite that. “So, we expect that the new people coming in should brace up, there’s plenty of work, it’s not just cheap talk, it’s not propaganda, it’s not blackmail, governance but pushing ahead and sustaining this development.” Copyright PUNCH.
