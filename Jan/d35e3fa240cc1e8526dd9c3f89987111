The Governorship Candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance in the 2019 general election in Imo State, Senator Ifeanyi Araraume, said on Wednesday that he had accepted the final outcome of the protracted legal battle on the Imo poll. The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed Ararume’s appeal seeking the nullification of the Imo election on the ground that former Governor Emeka Ihedioha did not meet the two-third constitutional spread. The apex court, however, annulled Ihedioha’s election and declared Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress the rightful winner of the election. In a statement issued in Owerri, Araraume stated that he had accepted the verdict of the apex court and congratulated Uzodinma. The statement read in part, “The Supreme Court has finally delivered its verdict on the protracted legal battle over the 2019 governorship election. “In its wisdom, the apex court finally declared my brother, Senator Hope Uzodinma, winner of the election. “I wish to state categorically that I accept the judgment of the Supreme Court and hereby congratulate Uzodinma.” Araraume said that as a firm believer in the rule of law, “I affirm my readiness to work closely and harmoniously with the new governor in the overall interest of the people.” He, however, appealed to his supporters to key into the agenda of the new government, describing peace and development of the people as the main purpose of governance.
