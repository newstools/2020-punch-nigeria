Femi Makinde Osun State Forum of Council Managers has said they will work hard to shore up the state’s Internally Generated Revenue at the local government level. They specifically assured the Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, that they were prepared to cooperate with the state government to improve the economy of the state. The Chairman of the forum, Mr Yinka Odewale, said this at a reception in honour of 11 managers who retired between 2016 and 2019 in Osogbo, the state capital. The managers said they were aware that the federal allocation to the state and the IGR could not meet all the obligations of the state, hence the need to shore up the IGR. Odewale said, “We will continue to work hard in the interest of the state and we will give 100 per cent support to Governor Gboyega Oyetola to succeed. “Also, workers at the local government level will continue to cooperate with all political functionaries for quick improvement in the revenue of the state.” The forum commended the governor for the way he had been managing the state’s resources and for paying full salaries to workers. The Chairman, Local Government Service Commission, Mr George Adedeji, lauded the retired council managers for their contributions to the development of the state. Copyright PUNCH.
