Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri Ex-Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha’s son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, has rejoined the All Progressives Congress, says a faction of the party in the state. Nwosu defected to Action Alliance  and represented the party during the March 9,2019, governorship election in the State, after the APC denied him the ticket. A statement on Friday by  the   factional Publicity Secretary  of the  APC headed by Daniel  Nwafor in the state, Jones Onwuasoanya, said  Nwosu and his supporters had been welcomed back. Onwuasoanya dismissed comments attributed to the  Chief Marcellinus Nlemigbo,  leader of the other faction that Nwosu had yet return to the party. He said, “We wish to reiterate that Chief Nlemigbo has no right to speak for the party at any level. His continuous impersonation as the state chairman of the party is an affront to a standing court judgement restraining him or anyone from interfering with the properly and democratically elected executives of the party, from ward to state level, led by Daniel Madueke Nwafor. “Nwosu has reregistered at his Eziama-Obaire ward and has been received into the party at the LGA and state levels. “Nwosu returned to the party with his numerous supporters across the 305 wards in the state, and these valuable party members have been fully reabsorbed.” Onwuasoanya added, “We must commend Ifeanyi Ararume for his support  for  the APC candidate for the Okigwe North Federal Constituency and we look forward to welcoming him and his numerous supporters back to our party as soon as possible.” Copyright PUNCH.
