Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia The  All Progressive Grand Alliance candidate for last year’s governorship poll in Abia State, Dr Alex Otti, on Tuesday insisted that Governor Okezie Ikpeazu did not win the election. Otti was reacting to the Supreme Court judgment, affirming Ikpeazu’s victory, after he  approached the apex court to overrule the lower courts. He   said in a statement by his media aide, Ferdinand Ekeoma, on Tuesday that the governor did not perform during  his first term to  deserve to win the election. The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed Otti’s appeal on the ground that he could not establish his allegation of over voting. Otti argued that Ikpeazu could not have won the election when  he was  allegedly owing workers and pensioners for several months. He however stated that he  had accepted the  judgment.
