Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia Bende Customary Court, eleven office blocks and adjourning blocks at the Bende Local Government Area of Abia State, were, on weekend, razed by fire. The office blocks house the agriculture department, Board of Internal Revenue unit, Examination Development Commission, National Population Unit, and many others. Commenting on the fire, the local government Chairman, Dr Hagler Okorie, noted that the destruction caused by the inferno would cost millions of naira to rebuild. He, however, expressed happiness that no life was lost and ordered council workers to clear the bushes around their offices and residential quarters and to switch off electrical appliances when not in use or when leaving their homes to prevent recurrence. Okorie called on the federal and state governments to assist the LGA to rebuild the destroyed structures so as “to restore official functions of the court and the council.” The cause of the fire has not been determined.
