An Oyo State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Iwo Road, Ibadan, on Tuesday, sentenced a 45-year-old scavenger, Kamorudeen Salau, to 30 days’ imprisonment for stealing Christmas decorations worth N25,000, property of the state government. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Taiwo Oladiran, found the defendant guilty as charged. Oladiran, who said that the convict should spend the jail term at the Agodi Correctional Centre, however, gave him an option of N20,000 fine. According to the police prosecutor, ASP Sunday Ogunremi, the convict had on December 26, 2019, around 11.30am stole some iron rods valued at N20,000 and some Christmas decorations valued at N5,000. The News Agency of Nigeria reported that the state government had decorated some roundabouts in Ibadan, the state capital, preparatory to the Yuletide. The police prosecutor said the offence was committed at the state secretariat roundabout, Agodi, Ibadan. The offence, he stated, contravened Section 390 (9) of the Criminal Code, Cap 38, Vol. II, Laws of Oyo State, 2000. The defendant had pleaded guilty to the charge preferred against him.
