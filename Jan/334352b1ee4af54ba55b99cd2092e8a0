Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi A fire outbreak on the runway of the Port Harcourt International Airport, on Saturday evening, disrupted flight activities. It was gathered that the fire prevented a Max Air flight from taking off while an Arik flight had to return to base. A Dana flight from Abuja to Port Harcourt also reportedly had to return to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, as it could not land due to the fire. Although the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria could not be reached, a source said it was a bush fire. The source said the airport had been closed for the smoke to dissipate and would be opened within a short period.
