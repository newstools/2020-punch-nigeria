’Tosin Oluwalowo SodiqYussuf won his fourth straight fight in the UFC 246 on Sunday, defeating American opponent Andre Fili. He won a three-round unanimous decision over Fili, with three of the judges scoring the fight 29-28 in his favour. “I feel fantastic, I am just happy that I delivered, I have always had a problem since I started training, the way I feel in my fighting and the way it looks like, it never matches, that’s why my coach is always there to tell me how to win, so, I don’t know if it looked good or not but I’m happy you guys said I delivered,” he said after the bout. The Nigerian is hoping to follow the footsteps of compatriots Israel Adesanya and Kamaru Usman, who he called his elder brothers. “My people, Nigerians. I’m representing. By God’s grace, I will also be a champion like my elder brothers Israel (Adesanya) and Kamaru (Usman),” he said in Yoruba. “It’s a solid win for sure, and I think I did show that I belong at the top of the division,” he added.
