Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, on Monday said members of the Peoples Democratic Party were plotting to overthrow the administration of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, (retd.). Uzodinma, who addressed members of the All Progressives Congress who were at the Government House in Owerri, on a solidarity march, urged heads of security agencies to launch investigation into the activities of the main opposition party. The governor said the motive of the PDP members was not about the judgment of the Supreme Court justices but to cause problem in the country, thereby overthrowing the current administration. He insisted that he won the March 9, 2019, governorship election in the state. Uzodinma said, “The motive of those who are wearing black, protesting around the country is not about the Imo State governorship election. If it is the Imo State governorship election, why are the PDP members protesting in Abuja, Bayelsa and everywhere in the country? Why are they not protesting only in Imo State? “The PDP wants to overthrow the government of President MuhammaduBuhari. I therefore use this medium to call on all the security agencies to begin investigation into the organised, synchronised national crisis which the PDP is plotting. “I did not challenge the election on the grounds of violence. I challenged the election on the grounds that INEC refused to accept the results of 388 polling units it accepted at the collation centres.” “The tribunal did not understand our petition. The appeal court gave us a minority judgment but the Supreme Court in its wisdom understood our petition and gave judgment in our favour.” Copyright PUNCH.
