Sola Shittu, Benin Leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Edo Central Senatorial District on Monday rose from a caucus meeting at Uromi with a demand to produce the governor of the state in the coming primary of the party. The PDP leaders’ demand is coming a week after the Afemai declaration of the Edo North PDP, demanded the post of deputy governor. The PDP leaders, who addressed journalists on the occasion included, Mr Hilary Ekhoye, Mr Richard Okosun, Mr John Yakubu, Broderick Itua, Mr Gideon Ikhine and Mrs Julie Okosun. They said the agenda of the Esan people in Edo State was to produce the next governor of the PDP because the post had eluded them for the past 22 years. Ekhoye said, “What we have resolved in that meeting is that Esan must produce the next governor of this state. “That is our decision; that is the position of Esan. We are not going for any other position. What we are asking for now is that other senatorial district should join us in our demand because Esan is the home of the PDP in Edo State.” A governorship aspirant of the party, Mr Gideon Ikhine, explained that  Edo State “is made up of three senatorial districts, North, South and Central and that  the PDP in Edo Central has always won elections for the party.” Copyright PUNCH.
