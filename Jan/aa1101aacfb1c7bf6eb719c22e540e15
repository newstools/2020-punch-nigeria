‘Femi Asu The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has directed that the suspension of the Managing Director of the Rural Electrification Agency, Ms Damilola Ogunbiyi, be reversed. The Minister of Power, Mr Sale Mamman, on December 24, asked Ogunbiyi to proceed on indefinite suspension “following some apparent infractions” in the agency. A statement from the minister’s Special Assistant on Media and Communications, Aaron Artimas, said, “Ogunbiyi is to hand over to the next most senior officer in the agency. Consequently, the minister has directed an immediate investigation into the activities of the agency towards repositioning it for better service delivery.” But the President, in a tweet on Tuesday via the Twitter handle, @NGRPresident, “directed that the suspension of Mrs Damilola Ogunbiyi from her role as Managing Director of REA be reversed.” Buhari said her resignation effective December 31, 2019 had been accepted to enable her to assume her new job at the United Nations. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, had in October last year appointed Ogunbiyi to serve as his Special Representative for Sustainable Energy for All, Co-Chair of UN Energy and Chief Executive Officer of Sustainable Energy for All. The power minister, in a statement on Monday, accused Ogunbiyo and the sacked MD of the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc, Marilyn Amobi, of being part of a cabal that held the power ministry by the throat. He said the cabal was “denying Nigerians the full value of their huge investments in the power sector.” CopyrightPUNCH.
