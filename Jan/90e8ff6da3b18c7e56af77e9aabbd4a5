Liverpool have struck a kit deal with Nike from the 2020-21 season to replace New Balance, the Premier League leaders announced on Tuesday. Nike will supply playing, training and travel wear for Liverpool’s men’s, women’s and academy teams and the coaching and Liverpool FC Foundation staff. “Our iconic kit is a key part of our history and identity,” said Liverpool managing director and chief commercial officer Billy Hogan.

Bert Hoyt, vice-president and general manager of Nike Europe, Middle East and Africa, said: “Liverpool Football Club has such a proud heritage and strong identity. “The partnership with Liverpool FC underscores our leadership in global football and with the club’s passionate worldwide fanbase and strong legacy of success — they have a very bright future ahead.” Liverpool won a court battle with New Balance in October, paving the way for the Nike deal. A judge ruled in favour of the European champions’ case that New Balance could not match Nike’s enormous distribution network and promise to market Liverpool via “superstar athletes and influencers”. These include LeBron James, Serena Williams and Canadian rapper Drake. Liverpool are currently 13 points clear at the top of the Premier League and are closing in on their first English top-flight title since 1990. Jurgen Klopp’s men are also through to the last 16 of the Champions League. (AFP)
