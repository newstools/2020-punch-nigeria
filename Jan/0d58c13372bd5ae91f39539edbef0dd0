Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The national secretariat of the World Bank-intervention State Employment and Expenditure for Results Project has declared Bayelsa State qualified to benefit from the phase two of the SEEFOR Project. The national coordinator of the project, which is under the Ministry of Budget and National Planning, Abuja, Dr Greg Onu, gave Bayelsa the passmark during a press briefing in Yenagoa on Wednesday. The passmark was preceded by a tour of projects carried out by the agency in the state. He said the Bayelsa SEEFOR Project had surpassed most of its targets in youth employment and public works in the implementation of the programme since its commencement in 2013. Onu noted that the state had constructed 402 concrete roads in communities as against its target of 137 and had employed 17,685 youths above the 16,000 benchmark for youth employment during the period. The 402 concrete roads are mainly targeted at schools, health facilities and markets which translated to over 70km of roads constructed through direct labour. Onu emphasised that Bayelsa was also making progress in ‘component B’  of the project which were mainly public financial management reforms.” He said,”Phase two projects depend on the performance of SEEFOR phase one projects. We have ticked Bayelsa good for performing above average. “They have surpassed their targets. We have yearly targets. We also have end-of-the-year targets. In summary, Bayelsa has surpassed most of its targets, going forward.” Also speaking, the state SEEFOR Project coordinator, Mr Ayens Adogu, stated that the agency was determined to improve on the quality of projects executed for the development of communities.
