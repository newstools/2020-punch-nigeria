James Abraham, Jos The Middle Belt Youths Forum has demanded the immediate resignation of the Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, as the Chairman of the Northern Governors’ Forum. The youths said their demand became necessary following the abductions and killings of citizens in the state and other parts of the North by the Boko Haram insurgents. The National Youth Leader of the MBF, Mr Emma Zopmal, made the call in a statement in Jos on Wednesday. He called on the governor to join forces with other well-meaning stakeholders for the liberation of the Middle Belt region. The youth leader alleged that the people had derived no tangible benefit from the governor’s position since he became the NGF chairman. He urged him to stand with his people, “during these difficult times.” He also warned him to desist from servicing the interest of “some northern elements.” Zopmal said, “Plateau indigenes have suffered gruesome deaths and abduction by the Boko Haram insurgents in Borno State. “With all these ugly developments, the governor of Plateau State, an illustrious son of the Middle Belt, has been serving as the chairman, Northern Governors’ Forum. “Borno State is one of the states he chairs and this evil is being perpetrated against his own people. “The footages of the killings by the terrorist group communicate messages showing sheer hate for Plateau people. “We kindly urge Governor Simon Bako Lalong to resign the position of chairman of the Northern Governors’ Forum and join his people in the struggle of Middle Belt.” Copyright PUNCH.
