Kayode Oyero The Peoples Democratic Party has kicked against the over 200 per cent electricity tariff increase by the federal government describing it as “draconian and completely against the interest and well-being of Nigerians.” The PUNCH had reported that the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission on Saturday directed the 11 electricity distribution companies in the country to increase their tariffs beginning from April. In a statement signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyn, in Abuja, the party stated, “Our party holds that the increase in electricity tariff, under the prevailing harsh economic conditions, is injurious to the well-being of Nigerians as it will further stress the productive sector and lead to an upsurge in the cost of regular and essential goods and services, including food, medicine, housing, education, and other critical needs.” READ ALSO: Electricity tariff hike: It’s daylight robbery, labour, others tell FG He added, “It is lamentable that Nigerians, who are already suffering the devastating negative impact of the recent increase in the Value Added Tax from 5 percent to 7.5 by the APC administration, are now being further suppressed with increased electricity tariff. “The PDP insists that any administration that has the interest of the people at heart should provide alternatives or hold consultations with the people before imposing such harsh tariff on its citizenry.” Ologbondiyan charged the Federal Government to immediately rescind the policy and consult further with Nigerians before any hike in electricity tariff. He described the increase in electricity tariffs as another burden on Nigerians, who were already overburdened with the weight of high costs, economic repression, and heavy taxes.
