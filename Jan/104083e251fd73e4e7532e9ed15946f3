Friday Olokor, Abuja The National Chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance, Chief Edozie Njoku, on Thursday called for electoral reforms in Nigeria. He made a case for electronic voting and transmission of results in subsequent elections. “The electoral process in Nigeria has to be reformed; we need electronic voting and electronic transmission of results,” Njoku said while reacting to the judgment of the FCT High Court in Abuja immediately after being returned as APGA National Chairman. According to him, his leadership would reach out to many persons including the founding National Chairman of the party, Chief Chekwas Okorie; and a former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi. Njoku said, “APGA needs to be rebuilt, the most important thing is reconciliation. I am not one of those who believe in expulsion. No, even if you are the biggest enemy of the party, we will try and bring you back because you are still very important. “If you have committed the greatest sin against the party, and it is not a criminal offence in Nigeria, we will try and talk with you so that we will all be brothers. We are going to visit and bring back all the people who have left the party.” Copyright PUNCH.
