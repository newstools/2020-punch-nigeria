Chima Azubuike, Gombe Gombe State Deputy Governor, Dr Manassah Jatau, has stressed the need for demarcation of boundaries between Gombe and Bauchi states. This, he said, would further cement the already existing cordial relationship between the two states. Jatau, who is the Chairman of the Gombe State Boundary Committee, spoke in Bauchi on Wednesday at a joint meeting of Gombe/Bauchi interstate boundary. He expressed optimism that the age-long relationship existing between the two states would not be severed by any boundary demarcation. He commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for directing the immediate demarcation of the boundaries and urged the National Boundary Commission to expedite action on the matter. “Governor Inuwa Yahaya is committed to a speedy and amicable resolution of any boundary issues between the two sister states and indeed any other state that shares common boundary with Gombe,” he said. In his address at the meeting, the Bauchi State Deputy Governor, Alhaji Baba Tela, who is also the Chairman of the Bauchi State Boundary Committee, said boundary demarcation was necessary for administrative convenience.
