Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission is expecting international experts in the power sector who will, among other things, provide guidance to help Nigeria reduce cases of grid collapse. According to the commission, industry professionals from America, Asia, Europe and other African countries are expected in Nigeria later this month to share knowledge with participants in the Nigerian power sector at an International Conference on Energy, Power Systems Operations and Planning. The Chairman, NERC, James Momoh, told journalists in Abuja that Nigeria was able to record zero grid collapse in 1992 after experts provided guidance on how to manage the situation during a similar conference in Nigeria that year. He said, “We hope to address issues of system collapse in Nigeria by reason of the conference. In the past, for example, we chose a topic on system collapse, which was a familiar thing in Nigeria in the 1990s. “Nigeria was a good place to go because they were also dealing with the problem as it was being dealt with in Tokyo and America. So, we thought it was better to come to Nigeria at that time to share experiences. “So, we learnt from each other by providing strategies on how to solve the problem. Believe me, that year, there was zero collapse in Nigeria after we finished that conference. “We recorded zero collapse in the country because the conference provided methodologies and approaches on how to deal with it.” Nigeria’s power grid has been recording collapses over time, as it experienced four collapses in the fourth quarter of 2019.
