Addressing the traditional rulers and stakeholders, Seth said the delegation was mandated by the state governor to visit the areas to assess situation and sympathise with the people over the incident. He assured them of government commitment to security of lives and properties. “The Governor would have led this delegation himself, but he is not around. He is outside the state for an official engagement that has to do with the interest of the state. “He said we should commend you for your resilience and support to security agencies and to urge you to continue to support our security personnel in their efforts to protect you,” Seth said.
