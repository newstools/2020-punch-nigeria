It stated that in October 2019, 35 vandalised-pipeline points, representing a decrease of 81 per cent from the 186 vandalised-points in September 2019, were recorded. This came as the corporation again posted a trading surplus of N13.23bn in October 2019, representing an increase of 54 per cent when compared to the N8.59bn surplus posted in September last year. In its October 2019 monthly financial and operations report, the NNPC stated that out of the 35 vandalised points recorded in the month under review, eight failed to be welded. It stated that only one pipeline was ruptured. Ibadan-Ilorin axis accounted for 34 per cent of pipeline breaks, while ATC-Mosimi and other routes accounted for 23 per cent and 43 per cent respectively.

The NNPC said the revenue increase of 54 per cent in its October 2019 accounts was largely due to improved trading surplus posted by its flagship upstream subsidiary, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company.
