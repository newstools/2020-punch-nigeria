Oladimeji Ramon A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, has asked the Lagos State Government and the Lekki Concession Company to state the amount of money they have generated since they began operating the tollgate on the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge. Adegboruwa made the demand in a statement on Monday, in which he called on the government to scrap the tollgate and allow free passage. He expressed the view that by now, the money spent on building the bridge, said to have been built through a Public Private Partnership arrangement between the state government and the LCC, must have been recovered. The activist lawyer said though the introduction of electronic payment system at the tollgate had drastically reduced gridlock common on the road, the desirable thing was for the government to scrap the tollgate.
