The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has congratulated the Chairman of Eleganza Group, Chief Razak Okoya, on his 80th birthday celebration. In a statement on Sunday, the governor hailed Okoya’s tenacity and sense of industry. He noted that his exploits as an industrialist remained a testament to the indefatigable spirit of hard work and resilience common with Nigerians. Obaseki said, “I send hearty felicitations as you mark your 80th birthday. It is quite heartwarming that you have made an indelible mark in the sands of time and touched the life of many who crossed your path. “As an industrialist, we are proud of all that you have achieved and the many more innovative ideas you are bringing to change Nigeria’s industrial landscape. “Managing large conglomerates has never been an easy task, but Chief Okoya has redefined the practice with his expert handling of a business concern that spans clothing, household appliances, stationeries, cosmetics and many others. “It is only with a rare mix of dedication and hard work that you have been able to groom and manage a conglomerate like Eleganza Group, which employs thousands of Nigerians directly and indirectly.” CopyrightPUNCH.
