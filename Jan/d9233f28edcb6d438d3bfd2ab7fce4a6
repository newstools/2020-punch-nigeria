Enyioha Opara, Minna The Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, on Wednesday said henceforth only the Nigerian constitution would be used for the swearing-in of elected officials and appointees in the state. Bello said this when the state Chief Judge, Justice Aliyu Mayaki, confirmed that swearing in with the Bible and Quran was not a constitutional requirement but merely symbolic. Bello said, “From now on, those to be sworn in will not have to use the holy books but deal with their consciences.” He however charged the new judges to discharge their duties without fear or favour to take the judiciary to the next level. The governor added, “I have no doubt in my mind that you will do the needful to ensure justice prevails when executing your functions.” Responding, Mayaki said, “What is important is the genuineness in you to dispense justice. It is not a constitutional requirement; swearing-in with the Bible and Quran is merely symbolic. “What is important is the genuineness in you to dispense justice, and you are bound by the law and to abide by the oath.” The new judges are Justices Salisu Majidadi, Danladi Ahmad and Binta Bawa.
