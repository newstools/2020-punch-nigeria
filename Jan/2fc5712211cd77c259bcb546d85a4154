The Lagos State Government has said there is the need for a change of approach to employment opportunities among job seekers to meet present day demands in the labour market. The acting Commissioner for the Ministry of Wealth Creation and Employment, Mrs Solape Hammond, stated this while addressing some graduates at a two-day workshop. The workshop was organised by the ministry in collaboration with a firm, 1st CRT Management Services, at Alausa, Ikeja. She said the government partnered the training firm to prepare young graduates for employment opportunities by enhancing their skills. “The current model of education, career planning and job searching needs a facelift.  Considering the dynamism in the global labour market, workers need not wait till the shift arise before learning and teaching the new rules of success. This requires the workforce to be proactive and strategic in thinking,” the acting commissioner added. Hammond, who was represented at the event by the Director of Employment in the ministry, Mrs Iyabo Seriki-Bello, said the partnership would also help government realise its THEMES agenda. The Chief Executive Oficer of 1st CRT Management Services, Mrs Folayemi Olaitan, urged well-meaning Nigerians and institutions to invest in human capacity development. Copyright PUNCH.
