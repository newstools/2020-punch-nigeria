Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A 21-year-old Internet fraudster, Arowolo Ariremako, has admitted to defrauding an American of the sum of $200. Ariremako, who appeared before a Federal High Court in Osogbo, Osun State, on Tuesday, pleaded guilty to the offences bordering on fraud preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The EFCC prosecutor, Oluwatoyin Owodunni, explained that Ariremako defrauded an American, identified simply as Gray. The defendant was said to have obtained the sum of $200 from the American. According to the prosecutor, the defendant opened a fake email account and posed as a woman to defraud his victim. The counsel for the defendant, Abayomi Alawode, urged the court to be lenient with his client, saying Ariremako could still be useful to the nation. Justice Peter Lifu found Ariremako guilty of fraud. He, however, adjourned the matter to January 31, 2020, for sentencing. Copyright PUNCH.
