World heavyweight boxing champion, Anthony Joshua, met with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Saturday, in the United Kingdom. In a video and picture that surfaced online, the heavyweight champion was seen prostrating while greeting Buhari. He also presented his heavyweight belts to Buhari. Joshua’s action attracted accolades from the Buhari’s aides and his family members, who attended the meeting. Joshua reclaimed his titles from Andy Ruiz Jr, a Mexican boxer, six months after the Nigerian-born-boxer lost the titles. The British boxer was born to a Nigerian-Irish father, Robert Joshua, and a Nigerian mother, Yeta Odusanya. Joshua’s father (Robert) is the grandson of one of Sagamu’s greatest men and late patriarch, Omo-Oba Daniel Adebambo Joshua, who was born in 1882. Ruiz had won the match in Madison Square, New York, while Joshua reclaimed the titles in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia in December 2019. The judges unanimously adjudged Joshua winner with 118-110, 118-110 and 119-109 over Ruiz Jr and he made history by winning the first world heavyweight title bout in the Middle East. The 30-year-old now has his WBO, WBA, IBF, IBO heavyweight titles back. He is the fourth deposed world heavyweight champion to win an immediate rematch in 127-year history of the category — 11th fighter to have attempted it. Copyright PUNCH.
