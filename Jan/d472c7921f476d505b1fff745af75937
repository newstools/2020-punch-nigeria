Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo After spending a week in the den of their abductors, two travellers abducted in Alamo village on the Iwo/Ibadan Road in Osun State have regained their freedom. The state Commissioner of Police, Johnson Kokumo, confirmed their release to our correspondent on Tuesday. The victims, whose identities were not revealed, were heading for Iwo from Ibadan in Oyo State when they were abducted by some gunmen in Alamo last week Monday. Though details of how the victims were rescued were not available as of the time of filing this report, the spokesperson for the Osun State Police Command, Folasade Odoro, who spoke on behalf of the CP, said they were rescued without ransom payment. Kokumo stated, “Sustained pressure from the police made the kidnappers to abandon the abducted victims. No ransom was paid. “Police personnel were in the bush combing the entire place until the victims were rescued unhurt.” The CP called on residents to always assist the police with relevant information that would help in preventing crime and assured them of prompt response to distress calls.
