Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Supreme Court will later on Tuesday (today) deliver judgment on the appeal challenging the election of Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State. The Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad, leading six other Justices of the apex court, announced this after the panel heard the appeal bordering on the dispute arising from the March 9, 2019 election in the state. The appeal was filed by the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the keenly contested election, Aliyu Sokoto. Tambuwal, who contested the election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, emerged the winner of the election with a slim margin after a second-round poll. Sokoto had challenged the Tambuwal’s victory at both the election petition tribunal and the Court of Appeal and lost. He further appealed to the Supreme Court which will give a final judgment on the dispute on Tuesday. The CJN announced, when he and other panel members were receding to the chambers to prepare their judgments, that they would return to deliver their verdict in one or two hours’ time. The panel will also return to deliver judgment on Imo State governorship tussle in which the victory of Governor Emeka Ihedioha is being challenged by Ifeanyi Ararume of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, and Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress.
