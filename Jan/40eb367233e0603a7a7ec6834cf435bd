A 71-year-old man Christopher Fallon,  faces up to 10 years in prison after he was found guilty of raping a disabled man repeatedly over a period of four years in the UK. Fallon, according to Metro.uk, has tricked the man in order to rape him for what the prosecutors believe could have been anything up to 150 times. He was said to have raped the man with learning difficulties two or three times a week under cover of intimate massages which were meant to treat a chronic condition. The victim had so many difficulties that he could not see he was being abused. Fallon, however, denied the 18 counts of sexual abuse and told the court that he never massaged the man, let alone touch him indecently. He was convicted of all counts by a jury and remanded in custody so a probation officer can assess the danger he poses before his sentencing on February 17.
