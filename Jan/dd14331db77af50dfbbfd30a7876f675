Hindi Livinus, Yola Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, has promised to recover public funds allegedly stolen by the immediate past administration. He therefore called on those involved in misappropriation of public funds during the immediate past administration to quietly return the looted funds before the start of the probe. Fintiri’s vow to recover stolen funds through a full scale probe came as his first public statement after the judgment of the Supreme Court which affirmed his victory as the duly elected governor. He spoke at the Ribadu Square, Yola after a victory walk which took him through some major streets. “Our belief is in the common man in the state. No matter how big you are and no matter whose son you are, if you have served the government yesterday and you have embezzled either at the state or local government levels, I  will soon start to recover the resources of this state that have been embezzled by the last administration,” he said. The governor also pledged the commitment of his administration to touch the lives of the common man. Copyright PUNCH.
