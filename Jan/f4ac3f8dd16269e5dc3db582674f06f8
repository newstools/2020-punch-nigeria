TED ODOGWU A Kano State magistrates’ court, sitting at Nomansland, on Friday remanded a corps member serving in Bebeji Local Government Area, Jepthan Makwin, in custody. Makwin is standing trial over the death of an eight-year-old boy. Makwin was accused of beating the boy, Hassan Suleiman, a class three pupil of Old Mosque Islamiyah School, Bebeji, to death in October 2019. The state’s NYSC Coordinator, Alhaji Ladan Baba, however, claimed the act was an accident. During the arraignment on Friday, the defence counsel filed an application for the bail of the accused person, before the presiding magistrate, Fatima Adamu.
