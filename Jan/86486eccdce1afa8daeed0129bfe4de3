Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe An Internet fraudster, Chibundu Anuebunwa, was on Thursday sentenced to one year’s imprisonment by the Lagos State Special Offences Court in Ikeja. Justice Mojisola Dada, however, gave the convict an option of N1.5m fine and ordered the forfeiture of N29.2m found in his possession during an investigation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The EFCC had arraigned Chibundu on two counts of conspiracy to steal and retaining stolen property which he was convicted of. The EFCC counsel, I. A. Mohammed, had told the court that the anti-graft agency received a petition dated July 10, 2019, from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States of America. According to him, the petition noted that the convict and his brother, Princewill Anuebunwa, who was at large, were involved in business email compromise fraud, romance scams, mystery shopper fraud and tax fraud. He added that the offences contravened sections 328(1) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015. Chibundu’s counsel, A. A. Adetunji, in his allocutus, urged the court to temper justice with mercy in sentencing him. “My Lord, the convict before you today was never arrested by the EFCC. He went to their office on his own accord, he is a family man, remorseful and has learnt from his mistake,” he pleaded.
