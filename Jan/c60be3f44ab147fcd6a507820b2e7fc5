Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State has described a former governor of the state, Chief Bisi Akande, as a bridge between the old and new Nigeria. Oyetola said Akande was committed to truth, the people and good governance in the state in particular and Nigeria in general. Akande will be 81 on Thursday (today). The governor, in a statement on Wednesday, by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, congratulated Akande on his 81st birthday. Oyetola described the elder statesman as a worthy mentor to the new generation whom he (Akande) “considers the strength and hope of the Nigeria that he is toiling for.” He added, “In a nation where his fellow octogenarians have retired from public service to the waiting arms of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, Baba Akande still burns the midnight oil to brainstorm on the future of Nigeria, armed with his high mental acumen and disarming smile. “It is obvious that God has been gracious to Baba Akande to be super active in old age because there is so much work to be done. We cannot thank God enough for His mercy and graciousness. “Baba Akande is a detribalised Nigerian who sees the country’s linguistic, ethnic and religious diversity as the nation’s greatest strength where Fifth Columnists capitalise on to tear the nation apart.”
