Chidiebube Okeoma,  Owerri The Legal Adviser of the All Progressives Grand Alliance in Imo State, Ifeanyi Olumba, has resigned his position. The politician, who communicated his resignation to the party  on Monday, said that he refused to be part of the political alliance between his party, and the All Progressives Congress. Olumba, a former Transition Committee Chairman of the Orlu Local Government Area of the state, said his conscience would not permit him to be part of any political arrangement between his party and the immediate past governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha. While conveying the reason for his resignation to APGA,  Olumba said, “I refused to be part of an alliance that is associated with Rochas Okorocha. “Therefore, as the Legal Adviser of the All Progressives Grand Alliance here in Imo State, I reign my position. “ The leader of APGA in the state, Senator Ifeanyi Araraume, visited Okorocha at his residence at Ogboko in the Ideato South LGA of the state during the festive period. The action fuelled speculations that the APGA and the APC wanted to form an alliance against the Peoples Democratic Party-led government in the state. Copyright PUNCH.
