Performance across sectors was bullish as four sectors recorded gains. The insurance and industrial goods indices led gainers, up by 0.86 per cent and 0.41 per cent on the back of price appreciation in Aiico Insurance Plc, Law Union and Rock Insurance Plc, Wapic Insurance Plc and Cutix Plc. The oil and gas and banking indices gained 0.36 per cent and 0.13 per cent due to buying interest in Oando Plc, United Bank for Africa Plc and Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. On the flip side, price declines in MTN Nigeria, Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc and Nascon Allied Industries Plc drove the AFR-ICT and consumer goods lower by 0.1 per cent and 0.22 per cent respectively.
