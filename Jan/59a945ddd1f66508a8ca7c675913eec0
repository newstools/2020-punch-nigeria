Leke Baiyewu, Abujat he Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has congratulated a musician, Wasiu Ayinde-Marshal, popularly called KWAM1 or K1 De Ultimate, on his installation as the first Maiyegun of Yorubaland by the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III. Gbajabiamila, in a statement on Sunday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, said Ayinde-Marshal’s selection as the first Mayegun of Yorubaland spoke volume of his contributions to the Yoruba race. He noted how the musician had been “mesmerising” Nigerians with his fuji genre of music over the years. The lawmaker said Ayinde-Marshal, who is to be installed by the Alaafin on Monday at his palace in Oyo, had carved a niche for himself, which he claimed, most Nigerians, especially lovers of fuji music, had come to cherish so much. Gbajabiamila also recalled how Ayinde-Marshal popularised his music among Nigerians across the length and breadth of the country, irrespective of religion or ethnicity. He said, “I have no doubts in my mind that the installation of Olasunkanmi Ayinde-Marshal as the first Mayegun of Yorubaland is an honour well deserved. “This is because he has not only become a household name in Yorubaland and indeed Nigeria as a whole, but has also been a good ambassador of the Yoruba people to the world.
