Deji Lambo A suspected military man is said to be on the run after he allegedly slit the throat of a man in the Itire area of Lagos State. PUNCH Metro gathered that the fleeing suspect perpetrated the crime during an argument with the deceased on Wednesday. Efforts to rescue the victim, who was taken to an emergency centre for treatment, were said to have proved abortive. One Samuel Agbolajo, who posted details of the incident on his Facebook page, said policemen from the Itire Police Division arrested the suspect. Agbolajo, however, said the yet-to-be-identified military man was later released in an alleged bid to cover up the crime. “Man slaughtered by a force man all because of argument. The Itire Police Station released the suspect all because he is a force man. We need the support of fellow Nigerians; they want to sweep this case under the carpet. Justice must be served. #PCRC #NIGERIAPOLICE,” he wrote. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, said, “We have no such case. I spoke with the Itire Divisional Police Officer and he said no such case was reported. Maybe it happened in another location, but not Itire.” Copyright PUNCH.
