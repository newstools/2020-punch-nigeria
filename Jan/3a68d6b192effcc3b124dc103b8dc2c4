Kelvin Ekerete Lille striker, Victor Osimhen, has promised to put his away goal nightmare at the French side to rest, vowing to score more goals on the road before the end of the season. The 21-year-old has only been able to record three goals away from the Stade Pierre Mauroy this season scoring his first in the UEFA Champions League 4-1 thrashing in the hands of Valencia. The forward also scored twice at Monaco in the space of a week in the Ligue 1 and the Coupe de La Ligue, but he feels he can do more, having scored several away goals during in time on loan at Belgian side Sporting Charleroi from Wolfsburg. Osimhen scored 12 away goals and eight goals at home in 36 games during his time Charleroi. Despite scoring just three times away from home this season, the highly sought after striker is confident the tide will change soon. “For me scoring away or at home is not a big deal,” Osimhen told only Sports Extra. “When I was at Charleroi, I scored more goals away than I did at home, so I think I just have a lot of luck scoring for Lille at home. “There are still lots of games to play this season and I think I can get a lot more away goals than I have scored at home and I’m really looking forward to it,” he concluded. Osimhen has been in superb form since joining the French side having also won the Player of The Month award for September and made the list of the best XI players for the mid-season ahead of French forward, Kylian Mbappe. Osimhen has scored 10 Ligue 1 goals in 19 appearances this season. Copyright PUNCH.
