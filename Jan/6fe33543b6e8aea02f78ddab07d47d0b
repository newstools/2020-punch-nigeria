Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The aggrieved 14 lawmakers-elect of the Edo State House of Assembly have accused Governor Godwin Obaseki of deliberately stoking crisis in the All Progressives Congress in order to destroy the party. They said the governor’s action and the endorsement he had received from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party showed that he was planning to defect from the APC. The camp of the governor and loyalists of the APC’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, have been fighting for the control of the party in the state with the 14 lawmakers yet to be inaugurated into the State House of Assembly. According to media reports, some hoodlums on Friday attacked the venue of a rally organised by the APC faction loyal to Oshiomhole in Ivekhe, Auchi. Addressing journalists in Abuja, the lawmakers, led by a former Speaker of the assembly, Victor Edoror, said they would not surrender to Obaseki’s plot to intimidate them. Edoror said, “It is clear that Obaseki is heading to another party following the endorsement he has received from the PDP leaders including the Governor of Ebonyi State (David Umahi).” The lawmakers complained about the governor’s incessant attacks on them and the national chairman. They called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), the APC national leader, Bola Tinubu, and other leaders of the party to caution Obaseki. They also called on the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to ensure protection of lives and properties in the state and to caution the state Commissioner of Police. Copyright PUNCH.
