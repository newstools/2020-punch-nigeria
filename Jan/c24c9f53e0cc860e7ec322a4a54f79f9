Mudiaga Affe The governorship candidate of the African Democratic Party in the 2019 general elections in Lagos State, Mr Babatunde Gbadamosi, has said lack of accountability by politicians is fuelling corruption. He said it was time for the electorate, especially in Lagos, to start scrutinising the intention, seriousness, sincerity, and programmes of those seeking their votes in elections. Gbadamosi stated this in Lagos on Monday after signing a pact with some civil society organisations on a campaign to create a far-reaching awareness among the Nigerian electorate on good governance. He said the focus of the strategic partnership would also include educating the people about their rights to demand accountability from elected and appointed public officers and top civil servants. Both partners agreed that the lack of accountability by elected and appointed officers were one of the major causes of corruption. He said,  “Democracy is not all about inducing people to get their votes or making empty promises to secure votes as we have witnessed over the years. “Nigerians must be able to understand and also demand their rights with the courage to demand accountability from politicians in offices. “We have also agreed to initiate critical programmes that would lead to massive enlightenment of the Nigerian electorate especially in Lagos on how to scrutinise the intention, seriousness, sincerity, and programmes of those seeking their votes in elections.” He further disclosed that the partnership would also focus on education, health, and power sectors to inform Nigerians about their rights to free access to these basic facilities.
