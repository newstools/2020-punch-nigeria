Maiharaji Altine, Gusau The Upper Shariah court sitting in Gusau, Zamfara State, on Wednesday granted bail to the state Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, Alhaji Ibrahim Goga, who has been standing trial for allegedly making comments capable of causing public disturbance. The court also granted bail to Alhaji Bello Gamji, who has been standing trial for alleged kidnapping and cattle rustling. The Presiding Judge, Justice Hadi Sani, said the two persons would however produce two sureties each who should be permanent secretary and a senior district head. They were also asked to deposit the sum of N3m each which would be forfeited if they jump bail. Counsel for the two accused persons, Bello Umar, requested the court to reconsider its decision regarding the sureties, as according to him, it would be difficult for the accused persons to produce permanent secretaries, considering the fact that they are civil servants. But the leading prosecution counsel, Aliyu Abdullahi Gusau, objected the request made by the defence counsel, arguing that they should try first and see if it would be impossible. The two APC chiefs have been in prison custody since November 26, 2019 for the various allegations levelled against them. Copyright PUNCH.
