Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Nigeria Immigration Service has said persons crossing the nation’s international borders must comply with the procedures on passenger clearance as contained in the Immigration Act, 2015 and Immigration Regulation, 2017. This, it said, was in line with the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria guidelines on international travel. The NIS spokesman, DCI Sunday James, said in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday, that the introduction of Migration Information Data Analysis System in the clearance of passengers had made it necessary for airport passengers to undergo certain clearance procedures. The statement read, “When a passenger is travelling with a minor, he/she is expected to present the minor to immigration for documentation. “In view of the above, it is mandatory for all departing passengers to present themselves for clearance two hours before departure of the aircraft. “The attitude of some passengers arriving at the immigration counter late will not be accepted.” The service said a passenger was deemed to have departed Nigerian territory after immigration clearance, stressing that no passenger would be allowed to leave the immigration control area after the departure clearance.
