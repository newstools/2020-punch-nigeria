Solape Lawal-Solarin Super Eagles dazzling winger, Samuel Chukwueze, might have lost out to Borussia Dortmund’s and Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi as CAF’s best young player but, that has not stopped Europe’s elite clubs from scampering to secure his signature. The likes of Real, Atletico and Liverpool have reportedly been linked with a swoop for the Nigeria international but, according to latest reports from Spanish outlet Foot Marcato, Champions League holders and Club World Cup champions, Liverpool, are seriously considering a move for the Villarreal starlet in the summer. According to Mercato, it is believed that the Yellow Submarines are softening their stance over his valuation and will be ready to consider offers in the region of £34m for the 20-year-old as Jurgen Klopp firms up interest in the Nigerian. Since his La Liga debut in 2018, Chukwueze has gone on to be a hit with the Andalusian side. The former Diamond academy player has scored three goals in 18 league appearances for Javier Calleja’s side this season. The Reds have already made one signing this month with the acquisition of Takumi Minamino from Red Bull Salzburg, and the addition of Chukwueze would provide yet another option to their fearsome attack. The Nigerian is also the third fastest player in the La Liga in the ongoing season clocking 34.58km/h behind Real Betis’ star Alex Moreno on 34.74km/h and Real Madrid’s Federico Valverde on 34.90km/h.
