Sola Shittu, Benin Gunmen on Tuesday abducted two teachers at   Obi Primary School in Avbiosi community in the Owan West Local Government  Area of Edo State. Our correspondent learnt that the hoodlums kidnapped the teachers – a male and female –   while they were teaching their pupils who had just resumed for the second term. It was learnt that development, which came barely two days after suspected Fulani herdsmen killed an 11-year-old boy in Sobe, had sparked panic in the Avbiosi community. Sobe is also in the Owan West LGA. An eyewitness said the gunmen stormed the school around 10.30am, ordering six teachers including those abducted at gunpoint to go with them. They were said to have shot indiscriminately while the operation lasted. However, four of the teachers reportedly escaped while being taken them away by the gunmen. It was learnt that police, supported by hunters and vigilantes, rescued the male teacher at night. Chairman of the council, Frank Ilaboya, promised that the female teacher identified as Mrs Esther Alabi would soon be rescued from her abductors.
