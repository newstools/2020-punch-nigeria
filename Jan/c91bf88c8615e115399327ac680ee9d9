Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt Gunmen suspected to be cultists on Monday killed three members of a local vigilante group in Rumuodogo One community, in the Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State. It was gathered that the suspected cultists, who killed members of the Odegu Security and Advisory Planning Committee in the early hours of Monday, also killed a motorcycle rider whose identify had yet to be ascertained. The vigilante members were said to be on their way to Rumuodogo One community in search of a cult leader and some of his men that had been declared wanted by the security outfit. A source in the area said the security outfit got information that one of the wanted cultists had returned to the area after fleeing from the community. The source added that while operatives of the local vigilante group were making their way into Rumuodogo One, the cultists ambushed and killed three of them. The source said, “The OSPAC people have brought peace to our community and called on all cultists to repent and stop their activities. They asked the repentant cultists to take an oath that they will not involve themselves in criminal activities. Some of the cultists accepted, while other refused and ran away. “OSPAC declared those of them that ran away wanted, insisting that only those who took the oath will stay in the community. People in the area are now living in fear because of this attack.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Nnamdi Omoni, said he had yet to get the details of the incident. “I have been getting calls from here and there concerning the incident and I have not been able to get the details of exactly what happened,” he said.
