Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, has directed the Governing Council of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and the selection board to proceed with the processes required for the appointment of a new vice chancellor for the institution. The management of the university had suspended the selection due to what it described as tension and security risk to the university arising from widespread allegations of breach of due process. But speaking through the Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono, while responding to a request by the Chancellor of the University, the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Alfred Achebe, for intervention in the disagreement over the selection process, the minister said the selection process should proceed as scheduled and in accordance with approved guidelines. This was contained in a statement in Abuja, on Sunday, by the Deputy Director, Information, Ministry of Education, Ben Goong. In an earlier correspondence to the ministry, copied to the chancellor, the outgoing VC, Prof Ibrahim Garba, had requested the ministry’s directive on how to proceed with the appointment of his successor, which he subsequently put on hold. But in his reaction, the minister said, having established that the processes and procedures adopted in the selection exercise were consistent with the approved guidelines and the University’s Act, proceedings should be continued to a logical conclusion.
