Top of the list are the English Premier League, who are ahead of the Brazilian league, La Liga, Serie A and the Colombian league, who make up the top five leagues. Meanwhile Chairman of the League Management Committee, Shehu Dikko, is elated by the progress of the NPFL. “It shows we are moving forward, jumping 20 places in one year, it was a challenging year. If we continue on this trajectory, we will get where we want to be – to be among the top,” Dikko told The PUNCH. “It just indicates that people are watching and we will review what is going on and make improvements. At least, to jump 20 places in one year is quite a leap, so, we are glad we are making some progress despite the challenges, but we can do more. Our ambition is to be at the top.” Copyright PUNCH.
