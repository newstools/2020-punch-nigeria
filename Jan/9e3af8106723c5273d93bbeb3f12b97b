Sola Shittu, Benin The Chairman of the Edo State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Dan Orbih, on Monday said the All Progressives Congress was campaigning for the PDP in the state through its abysmal performance in government. He said the PDP was ready to take the state from the APC. Orbih, who was addressing members of the PDP after receiving an honorary award at the Afemai declaration of the PDP Edo North Senatorial District, said the party had done well in the face of intimidation. He said, “The task in our hand is simple, the APC leaders are the ones campaigning for the PDP. The APC is an expired drug and we must put them aside. So, let us take this message to our wards that in unity, we will take over Edo State. “We have done so well against intimidation, let me also say that you have done very well in Edo North but please don’t relent. We have the governorship election coming up very soon.” Copyright PUNCH.
