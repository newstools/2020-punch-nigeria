Mudiaga Affe A Court of Appeal in Abuja has dismissed the case instituted by the Independent National Electoral Commission challenging the inclusion of the governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party, Natasha Akpoti, in the November 16 election in Kogi State. A Federal High Court presided by Justice Folashade Ogunbanjo-Giwa, on November 7, 2019, had ordered INEC to restore Akpoti as the candidate of the SDP in the governorship election. The electoral body, however, appealed the ruling. But, before the case with suit number CA/A/1123/2019 between INEC and Akpoti was dismissed, the counsel for INEC, Alhassan Umar (SAN), pleaded that the case should be withdrawn since the election had been concluded. “We respectfully apply that the appeal is withdrawn since the election which is the subject of the matter had been conducted,” he said. In his response, counsel for the respondent, Mr A.S. Oguajamma, conceded to the request. In the certified copy of the judgment which was made available to our correspondent on January 10, 2020, Justices Stephen Adah, Emmanuel Agim and Mohammed Idris, dismissed the appeal after the appellant had withdrawn the matter. “The appeal, having been withdrawn by the appellant is hereby dismissed under Order 11, Rule 5 of the rules of this court,” they said. In her reaction to the dismissal, Akpoti said her unjust disqualification by the electoral body on September 24, 2019, caused her great loss of followership and votes in the election.
