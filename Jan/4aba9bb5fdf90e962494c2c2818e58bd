Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt A socio-cultural organisation in Ogoni, Rivers State, Kagote, has said it will not force Governor Nyesom Wike or the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, to ensure that an Ogoni son becomes the state governor in 2023. The group said its immediate concern was to broker peace among the Ogoni people and pressure groups in order to attract more development to the area. The new leaders of Kagote stated this in Port Harcourt on Saturday during a media parley with the group’s President, Emmanuel Deeyah; First Vice-President, Priscillia Vikue: and Secretary-General B. A. Gwezia. Deeyah said, “We have set up a committee to look into the crisis that rocked the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People. We are working seriously to bring everybody together. “Our cardinal vision, that is, the new executive of Kagote, is to ensure that we restore unity among our people. “The main thing we have gained in our struggle is the clean-up, but we are not happy with the pace it is going. “When Amaechi or Wike became governors, was it Ogbako-Ikwerre that campaigned for them? It is not our primary focus to campaign for anybody on Ogoni governor. If we get it, there is no problem.” Copyright PUNCH.
