Olaide Oyelude, Katsina Governor Aminu Masari has signed into law a bill that restricts the movement of tricycles and motorcycles from 7pm to 6am in the state. The Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Alhaji Ahmed El-Marzuq, made the announcement  on Wednesday shortly after the governor assented to the bill at the Government House, Katsina. The commissioner explained that the law would come into effect from  January 20,2020 . El-Marzuq said the only exception to the law were members of the law enforcement agencies such as the military, police, civil defence, road safety corps, immigration and customs. He said, “The government took the decision because of the discovery that most of the kidnappings are being carried with tricycles and motorcycles in the entire state.” El-Marzuq warned that violators  of the law would be jailed for up to one year with an option of fine or both as prescribed by the Penal Code.
