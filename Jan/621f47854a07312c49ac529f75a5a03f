The Minister of Police Affairs, Alhaji Maigari Dingyadi, says the intentions of South-West governors for establishing Amotekun are good but the constitution bestowed the responsibility of national security on the Federal Government. NAN quoted Dingyadi as speaking during an interview with newsmen in Sokoto. The minister, who said the police were doing well in tackling the menace of kidnapping in all forms, enjoined Nigerians to support them in order to ensure maximum success in that regard. Commenting on the South-West security outfit codenamed “Operation Amotekun”, Dingyadi said, “The intentions of the Southwest governors are good. However, some people have expressed fears about the regional security force. ”Security is an exclusive responsibility of the Federal Government being supported at times by state governments and other organisations. ”If Operation Amotekun differs from the support being rendered by state governments to the Federal Government on security matters, then it is unconstitutional,” Dingyadi stated. He said that the border closure by the Federal Government had yielded results. Dingyadi further stated that the police would perform efficiently if the military personnel were withdrawn from areas affected by insurgency, saying that managing internal security was their primary responsibility.
