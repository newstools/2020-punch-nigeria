Sodiq Oyeleke A former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, has warned the Imo State Governor-elect, Hope Uzodinma, not to bear grudges against those who opposed his governorship ambition. Tinubu said this while congratulating Uzodinma on his verified Twitter handle on Wednesday. The All Progressives Congress’ national leader also cautioned the governor-elect against actions that could lead to disunity among members of the APC in the state. Recall that the Supreme Court in a unanimous judgment on Tuesday sacked Governor Emeka Ihedioha and declared Uzodinma winner. Tinubu said, “I congratulate Senator Hope Uzodinma, the people of Imo State and all Nigerians who believe in justice and seek the truth. “The Supreme Court’s proper and fair decision yesterday, declaring Senator Uzodinma as the rightful governor of Imo State was indeed a victory for truth and justice in Nigeria.

His perseverance has now been rewarded with the restoration of his mandate. “In effect, Imo’s new governor lived up to his very name, Hope. Indeed, Hope never gave up hope. “The Supreme Court has now spoken. Its decision is final. Therefore, there is nothing to be gained from speculation or second-guessing. The time has come for the people of Imo to unite and work towards a brighter future under Senator Uzodinma. “For the new Governor, the real work begins now. The Governor must dedicate himself to establishing a government that transforms the fortunes of the people. “I urge Senator Uzodinma to reach out to those who opposed him. He must let them know that he bears no grudges and seeks only good for all people of the state. “I know this is a disappointment for Governor Emeka Ihedioha and his supporters. I urge him to take solace in the fact that you conducted a spirited and vibrant campaign.”
