President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation, Daniel Igali, has expressed delight at the movement of the country’s wrestlers Blessing Oborududu and Odunayo Adekuoroye in the latest world ranking released by the United World Wrestling. This was revealed in a statement issued by the Media Officer of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation, Emeka Dennar, on Wednesday. Oborududu, who is the Commonwealth champion in the 68kg category, moved up to a career-high No. 3, following her impressive outing at the recently-concluded Matteo Pellicone Ranking Series tournament in Rome, Italy, where she won a bronze medal. Similarly, Adekuoroye reclaimed her second position in the global ranking, in the 57kg category with 43 points after winning gold at the tournament in Rome. She was earlier ranked No.3 in the world prior to the tournament. “The main aim of going to the (Matteo) Pellicone Ranking Series tournament was to improve our rankings at the world and have our athletes highly seeded in the top four in the Olympics. And everything has gone according to plan,” Igali said. “Last year Adekuoroye was No.2 but slightly dropped (to No.3), now she is back to No.2. Blessing Oborududu was No.4, dropped to No.7, now she’s back to No.3, which is her best ranking so far.”
