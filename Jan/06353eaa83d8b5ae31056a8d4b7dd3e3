The Nigerian Railway Corporation has said its suspended Lagos-Ogun mass transit train service would resume operations on Thursday. The District Manager of NRC in Lagos, Mr Jerry Oche, disclosed this in Lagos on Wednesday. Oche said that the operation, suspended in September 2019, would resume with one return trip daily from Kajola in Ogun to Iddo in Lagos. He said, “We hope to resume the Lagos mass transit tomorrow, Thursday. We will start with just one return trip tomorrow. A return trip for us is to and fro. “Part of the reasons we are operating one trip is to conduct trials on the tracks that have just been done and also because of the construction of standard gauge rail line ongoing.

All we want to do now is one return trip each day for some time before we fully bounce back,” Oche said. Oche added that freight services would not return on Thursday because there was more work to be done on the tracks, but the operation would commence soon. The corporation suspended daily train services, including Mass Transit Train Services on the narrow gauge from Ijoko in Ogun to Ebute-Meta and Apapa in Lagos State in September 2019. The suspension was to fast-track the completion of the new Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge line which required shifting the existing narrow gauge and relaying it to accommodate the standard gauge rail line. The project is being handled by China Civil Engineering Construction Company. The corporation had earlier informed its customers that the suspended train services would resume on Nov. 15, 2019, but could not make it happen. (NAN)
