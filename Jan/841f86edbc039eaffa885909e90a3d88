Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has declared that he will not work towards imposing a governor on Rivers’ people at the expiration of his second term in 2023. Wike, who made this declaration on Saturday during a solidarity visit by the Orashi Region of Rivers State at the Government House in Port Harcourt, said power would never be extended as a gift to any group. “For the governorship position, if you have the capacity, come out and contest. Nobody zoned governorship to me, I struggled for it. I will not impose anybody on Rivers people as governor in 2023. “I will not do it; I don’t even have that power, not to talk of giving it out. You cannot give what you don’t have. To be the governor of Rivers State, you must have the capacity to deliver,” he said. Wike warned against the politics of bitterness, which, he said, had denied several Rivers communities access to developmental projects. He said, “Don’t allow anyone to sow the seed of discord among you. Politics should not divide us. Politics of bitterness does not make sense. All of us must not be in one political party. But you must support yourselves to attract projects to your area.” Earlier, former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Chibodum Nwuche, thanked the state governor for siting key projects in Ekpeye land. He described the governor as a beacon of hope, who played politics of inclusiveness. In an address on behalf of the people of Orashi, Eze Egi of Ogbaland, Prof. Anele Nwokoma, congratulated the governor for his victory at the polls despite the political gang-up against him.
