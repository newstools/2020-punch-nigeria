Mudiaga Affe The  Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party on Tuesday  protested against last week’s  Supreme Court judgment sacking  Emeka Ihedioha as governor of Imo State. Dressed in black attire, the protesters , who marched  from their secretariat along Adekunle Fajuyi Road to the state High Court in Ikeja,  condemned the judgment, saying it  was “a miscarriage of justice”. The Supreme Court ruled that Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress was the rightful winner of the March 2019 governorship election. But the Lagos State  Chairman of the PDP, Mr Deji Doherty, who led the protest, said the judgment had thrown the party into mourning. Addressing journalists at the Lagos State High Court, Doherty said the Supreme Court judgment had destroyed the trust and sympathy Nigerians had for the judiciary. Doherty said, “I am sure if an inquest is conducted concerning the issues that led to this judgement, we would find out the unimaginable inconsistencies that must have played out during the deliberations between the judges. “However, for us in the PDP, it isn’t the end of the world but the beginning of a new chapter in the history of democracy in Nigeria and a call for us as a party to go back to the drawing board and re strategise. “A dark cloud of uncertainty has suddenly covered the skies above our dear country.” Also speaking, a former Minister of African Integration, Dr Abimbola Ogunkelu, urged the Supreme Court to reverse the ruling. “The Supreme Court can still revert itself because the judgment does not urge  well for the epic court which happens to be the last hope in judicial matters in the country to give a ruling that is not convincing,” he said.
