AC Milan are hopeful of signing Bournemouth goalkeeper Asmir Begovic as their replacement for Pepe Reina. Reina has been acting as No 2 at the San Siro behind Gianluigi Donnarumma but is set to leave for Aston Villa early next week after a loan deal was agreed between the clubs. Skysports reports that Begovic has just returned to the Vitality Stadium after spending the first half of the season on loan in Azerbaijan with Qarabag. Eddie Howe revealed in Friday’s news conference that Begovic’s future might not be with the Cherries.
