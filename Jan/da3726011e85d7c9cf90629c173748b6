Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt OFFICIALS of the Rivers State Ministry of Works and Julius Berger Plc on Monday began the demolition of marked structures to create the right of way for the Rebisi Flyover to be constructed at former Garrison. The officials used earth-moving equipment to bring down the structures, which would have blocked construction workers from carrying out their job successfully. Recall that the State Governor, Nyesom Wike, had last week, met with traders and residents to sensitise them to the necessity of the exercise. It was gathered that the demolition commenced after the state government had paid compensation for the marked structures. The Julius Berger’s Project Manager of the Port Harcourt Flyovers, Finn Drosdowski, said, “The three locations where we are constructing flyovers are places with traffic congestion. After the construction, the issue of traffic congestion would be resolved. We will finish the projects on schedule.” Copyright PUNCH.
