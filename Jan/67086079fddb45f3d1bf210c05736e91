Samuel Awoyinfa Workers in the Ogun State Ministry of Information have been urged to reciprocate the good gesture of the present administration with improved service delivery in the new year. The Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mr Abiodun Awere, gave the charge during   an inter-religious prayer session to commence activities for the new year, held at the agency’s car park, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. Awere noted that the present administration had continually ensured prompt payment of workers’ salaries and other benefits since inception, saying this should spur the workers to perform better in their respective duties, while punctuality, commitment and discipline should be embraced by all. Thanking God for His goodness over the state and the workforce, Awere appreciated the workers’ support last year, soliciting more harmonious relationship, mutual love and respect, for the ministry to optimally service the information machinery of government. Earlier in his sermon, a worker of the ministry, Mr Odunayo Ogunleye, said righteousness would reign in any nation if the citizens and workers were in accord with what was right at every opportunity. He condemned the acts of usurpation of authority, hatred, back-biting and unhealthy competition among workers, describing them as sin against God and authority and capable of drawing back the wheel of progress.
