Success Nwogu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party on Tuesday said it was surprised at the judgment of the Supreme Court on the Imo State governorship election. The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement described the judgement as yet another very sad commentary on the nation’s democratic order. He said, “The party finds it difficult to understand how Senator Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress, who came 4th in the March 9, 2019 governorship election, with just  96,458 votes, will suddenly, by the token of the judgment of the Supreme Court, defeat Chief Emeka Ihedioha/PDP who scored 276,404 votes. “In fact, the PDP and indeed, most Nigerians are still at a loss as to understand the basis upon which the Supreme Court arrived at its decision. “The party says it is lamentable that the destiny of the people of Imo state is being taken from the governor they chose and voted for and handed over to individuals and a political party that do not have their blessing and mandate and which they rejected at the election.” READ ALSO: Uzodinma’s victory: Judicial neutrality at its very best, says Keyamo Ologbondiyan said that the people of Imo state are now confronted with the challenge of having a government that they cannot identify with and which cannot connect with them. He stated that all the gains, including the development and stability already achieved by the people-based government, Ihedioha/PDP administration in the state, are now heavily jeopardized. According to him, indeed, the mournful and despondent ambience that now pervades Imo is a loud testimony that the judgment did not reflect the expectation of the people of as expressed at the polls. Ologbondiyan said, “While recognising that the judgment of the Supreme Court is final, the PDP, however, urges all party stakeholders in the state to remain united and calm, and await further instruction from the national leadership on this very sad development.”
