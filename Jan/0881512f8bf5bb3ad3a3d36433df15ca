Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company has appealed to relevant authorities to prevail on the Ijaw Youth Council to vacate its offices in Yenagoa to enable the company to serve its customers in Bayelsa State. The Corporate Communications Manager of PHED, Mr John Onyi, said in a statement on Monday that it had become imperative for “security agencies and government “ to wade into the face-off between the Disco and the IYC. The rift between the PHED and the IYC, which started on December 23, 2019, entered the 15th day on Monday as blackout persisted across the state. The Ijaw youths had occupied the Disco’s business offices in the state capital and hoisted its flag, forcing the company to shut operations. They are angry with the electricity distribution firm for allegedly cheating consumers in Bayelsa State using exorbitant estimated billings without commensurate power supply. Onyi said it was regrettable that economic activities in the state had been paralysed as a result of the action of the IYC. He said, “But it is ideal to bring to public knowledge that world-over, the demand and consumption of electricity has a cost element which has ceased to be the case here. “PHED completely distances itself from any economic dislocation inflicted on its valued customers in Yenagoa arising from the unlawful action of the IYC to keep the state in total darkness.” Copyright PUNCH.
