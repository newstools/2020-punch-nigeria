John Charles, Makurdi A Tiv socio-cultural organisation, Mdzough U Tiv, has said the comments made by the Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, against the Tor Tiv, Prof James Ayatse, were sacrilegious and injurious to the Tiv nation. The group said rather than divide the Tiv nation, Akume should use his position and resources to advance the cause of unity, progress and tradition of the people. The organisation, in an open letter to the minister, signed by its President, Edward Ujege: and Secretary, Boniface Ukende; said Akume’s anti-Tor Tiv comments were sacrilegious and injurious to the stool of the monarch, the Tiv Traditional Council and the entire Tiv nation. The Tiv socio-cultural group called on the minister to de-escalate the tension in order to keep the peace in Tiv land. The statement read, “Mdzough U Tiv re-echoes the stand of the Tiv Traditional Council that you should urgently appear before the council to clear your name and resolve the issues for the overall benefit of the Tiv nation.” Copyright PUNCH.
