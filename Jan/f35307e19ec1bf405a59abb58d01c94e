Ihuoma Chiedozie Indications have emerged that some  of the workers dismissed by the National Identity Management Commission are threatening legal action against the body. No fewer than  six workers were sacked  by the  commission after being indicted for extortion during  the ongoing National Identity Number enrolment. Some of the dismissed workers were also indicted for illegal and unauthorised printing of the NIN for external organisations. However, our correspondent has learnt that some of the officers are planning to take the  NIMC  to the National Industrial Court to overturn their dismissal. A source  told our correspondent that besides  demanding reinstatement, the dismissed workers are also considering asking the court to compel  the NIMC to  compensate  them. The source said, “Some of them have  already approached lawyers over the matter. “They are planning to take the matter to the National Industrial Court. “They want the court to overturn their sacking and also ask the  commission  to compensate  them for  sacking them.” Our correspondent further learnt that the dismissed workers we are insisting that the NIMC Senior Staff Disciplinary Committee, who  investigated them, lacked the powers to dismiss them from the service. But our correspondent learnt that a lawyer approached by one of the dismissed workers turned down the case on the ground   that  “extortion  is  a criminal offence.” The General Manager, Legal Services, NIMC, Hadiza Dagabana told our correspondent that, apart from terminating their appointments, they were also considering filing criminal charges against the dismissed workers.
