Peter Dada, Akure There was a mild drama at the Ondo State Magistrates’ Court, Akure, on Friday as the magistrate, Charity Adeyanju, prevented journalists from covering the trial of a popular pastor in the town, Alfa Babatunde. Babatunde is standing trial over the missing of a boy in his church. Prior to the action of the magistrate, the police prosecutor, Mr Uloh Goodluck, had approached the journalists to leave the courtroom but the journalists refused on the ground that the prosecutor did not have the power to send anybody out of the court. After the refusal to vacate the courtroom, the policeman was said to have headed to the magistrate’s chamber and reported the matter to him. Shortly after, the magistrate came out and ordered all the journalists in the court to leave without giving any reason. After the journalists had left the courtroom, Babatunde was brought into the court premises alongside with six other defendants, who are workers of his church. It was gathered that the magistrate ordered the defendants to remain in the Olokuta Correctional Centre pending the hearing of the legal advice from the Directorate of Public Prosecution. She later adjourned the case till February 5, 2020. The defendants were taken to court on six counts bordering on felony, conspiracy, and kidnapping. Copyright PUNCH.
