You are a great Afro hip hop artiste; can we say the same on your knowledge of sports? I’m not doing badly. I used to play football but these days because of time, I play more of table tennis and snooker. Did you play any competition while in school? Yes, when I was in secondary school I played inter class competitions and I was really good but it was just unfortunate that I never won anything to show for my effort. Which is your favourite position? I like to play as a winger, that’s my favourite position because I’ve got lot of speed and I can dribble very well too. Between you and Okocha, who would you say was the better dribbler? I’m better than Okocha, and this is not just my own words. People usually told me I dribble better than him. How come you never considered playing professional football? Well I tried, but at some point, if  you’re not getting the right encouragement you lose interest. Where I’m from, my family makes sure you go to school and that’s why I made sure I finished my National Diploma before delving into music. Let me just say that football didn’t work for me the way I wanted it. When was the last time you took to the pitch to play football? I think it was early last year at Fun Turf in Lekki. Do you watch European football? Yes I do but not all the time because of my busy schedule. Which football club do you support? I support quite a few. I’m a big fan of Arsenal; I also support Barcelona as well as Liverpool. But I’m more of an Arsenal fan but I think I just support good football at the end of the day. Are you gradually dumping Arsenal for Liverpool? No, I don’t think so, I just love football, and I’m still a big Arsenal fan. I know presently Arsenal are not doing well but that doesn’t change the fact that good football is good football.

Definitely, I’m not going to be happy, but in football you lose some and win some and, even though Arsenal have not won any major trophy for a while now, that still does not mean they’re not playing good football. Do you think Mikel Arteta is the right man to fill the void left behind by Arsene Wenger? Yes, though Wenger didn’t really achieve much before he left. It was more like an old glory but hopefully, maybe one day, Arsenal will get a manager that will understand them, and  understand what it takes to win trophies and not just playing good football and making money. We all know Arsenal are making a lot of money but we’re not winning trophies and definitely the fans won’t be happy. For you to earn more trust and support from the fans you need to win trophies. Hopefully they will get a manager that will concentrate more on trophies than making money. Do you watch Nigeria Professional Football League? Any time I’m chanced to watch, I watch the league because I’m always interested in what’s going on in our league. What are the areas you feel the League Management Company can work on to improve the league? I think we need to put sentiment aside and just pay attention to our thing. I think in Nigeria as a whole, we normally neglect our things and concentrate more on things that are happening outside Nigeria. We need to believe in what we have, we need to believe in the talent that we have. We need to believe that from here, we can take over the world before we can actually move forward. I feel like the players in our league are underrated.  I’ve been to quite a lot of countries in Europe and I’m a friend to some of football club owners. What I experience from them is the passion in what they do, and the belief they have in their team and their club, which I don’t see here in Nigeria.  Even the businessmen and billionaires, they need to invest more in our league, they need to pay more attention and see the future from what we have here and not just hyping the clubs outside Nigeria. It doesn’t just work, we are the ones that will make it work, that’s what I feel. What’s your take on our national teams? I think we’re doing very well these days, we’re actually getting better and I’m proud of that. I think Gernot Rohr is doing well and I think if he’s given more freedom, he’ll be able to do better. I have a couple of Nigerian footballers as friends and from the way they talk I think we’re getting somewhere. We have lot of young footballers coming up, which is quite interesting. Do you think they can be as good as the team that won Tunisia ’94? Let’s not be negative, negativity is part of the problems we have in Nigeria. Let’s just be positive and show them love and support. They are doing better than five, six, seven years ago. So let’s just pray and support them. Do you have any relationship with other athletes? Aruna Quadri is my friend and I’ve been challenging him to come over, because I have a table tennis board at home. First of all, I am actually very proud of Quadri, he’s been putting Nigeria on the map when it comes to table tennis and everyone loves him because of his commitments. If you can, would you consider buying a club in the Nigerian league? I will be more than glad to buy a club in our league if I have the money to. We will change everything and show them how it’s being done outside the country.  You can’t blame people for the wrong things they do unknowingly, the only problem is when they do it internationally.  Some don’t even know and just want to stick with the status-quo, they don’t research, and they want to do things based on the Nigerian standards always. They don’t want to find out how some countries or club. Do you have words of encouragement for the youths and everyone reading this? I want to tell them to go for what they believe in and not let anybody tell them that they can’t do it because once you start listening to negative people then you won’t do it. That thing you believe in and you know you have passion for, go for it, work for it, fight for it, sweat for it, don’t stop and don’t let anybody stop you. It is as simple as that; pray, work hard and fight. CopyrightPUNCH.
