Success Nwogu, Abuja The Director-General of the Peoples Democratic Party Governors’ Forum, Mr Osaro Onaiwu, on Wednesday said he and members of his family escaped death earlier in the day when suspected armed robbers invaded his residence. The men, numbering about five, were said to have stormed the compound located inside an estate around Games Village at about 1am and shot sporadically before gaining entry into Onaiwu’s house. Onaiwu told journalists in Abuja that the robbers made away with cash and valuables estimated at over N100m. He said the robbers stole trinkets, two televisions sets and telephone handsets belonging to him, his wife and their children among other valuables. He said he was devastated over the incident but was grateful to God that none of his family members died or sustained any serious bodily injury. He expressed surprise that the suspects could operate in that manner and escape from the area unchallenged. Copyright PUNCH.
