Success Nwogu, Abuja The Deputy Director of MacArthur Foundation, Mr Dayo Olaide, has said Nigeria has had a total budgets of N60tn from 1999 to 2019. He alleged that the N60tn had not been well managed. According to him, this has led to underdevelopment, lack of infrastructure and poor human capital development. He spoke during the public presentation of a book: ‘Nigeria, Corruption and opacity in governance,’ in Abuja on Thursday. The book was written by a development consultant and public affairs analyst, Mr Jide Ojo. Olaide, who represented Africa Director, MacArthur Foundation, Dr Kole Shettima, alleged that corruption had been a major impediment to national development. He said, “Between 1999 and 2019, Nigeria had actually budgeted over N60tn. Whatever conversion, that is billions of  dollars. If our budget size has grown so humongous over the period, the simple logical questions is: how has that impacted the living conditions of the Nigerian people? “Within that same period, corruption has remained very high, our maternal mortality may have reduced, that remains fairly high within the continent. And the state of infrastructure generally, if there is any improvement at all, is very minimal. So Nigerians has every reason to call out the managers of the economy from  1999 till date to provide a stewardship report of what has happened.” Copyright PUNCH.
