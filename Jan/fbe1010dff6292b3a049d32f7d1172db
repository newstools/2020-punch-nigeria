’Tosin Oluwalowo President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick, has said Sadio Mane and Asisat Oshoala, winners of the men and women’s categories of the 2019 Africa Player of The Year awards are role models in their communities. Pinnick, in a statement issued by the communications department of the NFF on Thursday, said both players deserved the best players awards. He also congratulated them for achieving the feat, saying the award came as a result of their consistency. “There is no doubt that both players deserve their awards,” Pinnick said. “Mane has been very consistent for a number of years and has worked hard to improve himself in all areas of his game, and I must say the same goes for Asisat Oshoala, who has also been an impact player for FC Barcelona Ladies within the short time that she arrived at the club. “Mane and Oshoala have also been role models in their native communities with their commitment and investment in charity causes. “I congratulate both players and urge them to continue to improve as they strive for excellence in all areas.” Mane beat competition from clubmate Mohammed Salah of Egypt and Manchester City’s Algeria forward, Riyad Mahrez, to claim the award for the first time. Oshoala, however, equaled compatriot Perpetua Nkwocha’s record, clinching the award for the forth time after earlier winning in 2014, 2016 and 2017. The Super Falcons captain placed first ahead of Cameroon’s Ajara Nchout and South Africa’s Thembi Kgatlana at the awards held at the Albatros Citadel Sahl Hasheesh, Hurghada, Egypt, on Tuesday.
