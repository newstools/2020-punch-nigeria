A former commissioner during the administration of former governor Abdul Aziz Yari of Zamfara State, Alhaji Kabiru Jabaka, has denied media report that he was still romancing with his former boss. Addressing journalists in Gusau on Monday,  Jabaka who served as Commissioner for Higher Education under Yari, said there was never a time he said he was still with Yari as reported by one of the national dailies (not The Punch). He described the report as not only false but also malicious, alleging that it was aimed at tarnishing his good reputation in the presence of  his teeming supporters. He said,  “I decided to take a legal action against the paper, but considering my good relationship with many of you here ( journalists) I have dropped the idea but I am appealing to you to please always cross-check your facts before publishing.” Jabaka stated that, he only accompanied his political ally, Alhaji Sani Jaji, to Yari’s house, stressing that, “I didn’t go there for any political issue.”
