John Ameh, Abuja The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Sunday, condoled with the family of renowned businessman and PUNCH director, Dr Lekan Are, who died on Saturday. Are, a foremost agronomist, died on Saturday at the age of 86. He died at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Oyo State, after a brief illness. Buhari’s condolence message was contained in a State House statement signed by his media aide, Mr Femi Adesina. The President urged the family of the late PUNCH director to “find solace in the good deeds and the good life lived by the departed.” Buhari said Are would be missed in many respects, particularly his contributions to the hospitality industry of the country. The statement partly read, “President Buhari condoles with friends and associates of Chief Are, whose outstanding contributions to the hospitality industry in Oyo State and the nation will be sorely missed. “The President believes the businessman’s investments in people and institutions will leave lasting memories of his selfless and sacrificial life, noting the prominent roles he played in his alma mater, serving as patron of the Government College Ibadan Old Boys’ Association for many years. “President Buhari prays that the Almighty God will accept the soul of the departed, and comfort his family.” Are, until his death, was the longest-serving director on the Board of PUNCH Nigeria Limited. A former director of WEMA Bank, Are was also the Chairman of Kakanfo Inn and Conference Centre, Ibadan, as well as a former chairman, University of Ibadan Press Plc. Copyright PUNCH.
