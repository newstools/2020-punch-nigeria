Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki Scores of the Peoples Democratic Party members in Ebonyi State on Monday protested against the Supreme Court judgment that sacked Emeka Ihedioha as the Imo State Governor. They demanded that the judgment be reversed within 24 hours. The protesters also asked the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Mohammed, to resign immediately over the judgment. The protesters wore black attires during the protest. They displayed placards with inscriptions such as ‘Supreme Court judgment on Imo governorship petition must be reversed,’ ‘NJC must intervene; Justice Tanko Mohammed must resign,’ and ‘Ihedioha must return as Imo Governor,’ among others. They marched from the PDP state secretariat along Abakaliki/Enugu Expressway to the Federal High Court, Abakaliki, where they met the entrance gate locked. Not dissuaded by the absence of court officials, the protesters, led by the party’s National Vice Chairman, South-East zone, Chief Austin Umahi, said it was either the new Imo State governor resigns or the citizens would lose faith in the nation’s judiciary. Umahi said, “It is very unfortunate that our democracy has been murdered. “We want to warn that we are not foolish. We understand what have been going on in this country. If not for the rule of law, will the APC be in government today?” Copyright PUNCH.
