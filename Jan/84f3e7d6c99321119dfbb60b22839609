However, our correspondent learnt that  the insurgents suffered more casualties  during the battle. Security sources revealed that  the  police  also played a great role in repelling the insurgents. According to a source,  policemen, led by the Commander of  the Borno State  Rapid Response Squad, CSP Abioye Babalola, and Operation Commander, Special Anti-Robbery Squad, Borno State Command, CSP Mohammed Ibrahim, who were patrolling the   highway  in Armoured Personnel Carriers alongside their men, joined  forces with the troops  when  they arrived at the scene of battle. The source said   the  APCs  proved useful in subduing the hoodlums. It was   learnt that   government forces recovered  two gun trucks  the insurgents had already taken from the soldiers. The source said, “Two gun trucks were recovered, but six soldiers were lost in the gun duel.  Two corpses of Boko Haram  fighters were seen after the shootout but many corpses were taken away by the insurgents. “Many Boko Haram fighters   suffered varying  degrees of injury as  they  were seen leaping off in flight. “The police team was boosted by  the new APCs procured by the Inspector-General of Police (Mohammed Adamu).” Babalola, who confirmed the fight, refused to  give  the casualty figure on the side of government forces. Meanwhile, following the  fight, the Maiduguri-Damaturu Highway  has been reopened. Copyright PUNCH.
