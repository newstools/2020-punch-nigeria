Hindi Livinus, Yola A local vigilante who held the title of Kaigaman Ybango, Alhaji Haruna Gamjango, has reportedly killed three suspected kidnappers at his residence in Jarandi, in the  Jada Local Government Area of Adamawa State. Haruna was, however, overpowered by his assailants who eventually killed him. One Maikudi, who spoke on the telephone to our reporter, said the gunmen had stormed the residence of the renowned local crime fighter around 11pm on Monday, with the intent of abducting him. He said, “His assailants who came in large numbers had attempted to abduct him. But he refused to follow them and shot three of his attackers. One died on the spot while the two others died later as a result of the injury he inflicted on them.
