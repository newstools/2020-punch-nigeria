Solape Lawal-Solarin On-loan Liverpool forward, Sheyi Ojo, might be heading for Rangers exit during the January transfer window. The 22-year-old joined Rangers this season from Liverpool after struggling to break into the Reds’ first team. However, after kicking off his Ladbrokes league campaign with the ‘Gers’ on a good note, bagging a goal in the league before adding another four in other competitions, the England youth international had a blip and has struggled to retain his spot in Steven Gerrard’s starting IX. And according to tbr.com live broadcast monitored by Sports Extra, Ojo looks surplus to requirement at Ibrox and is expected to be shipped out. “Ojo was Gerrard’s trusted man, he started very well, scoring five goals, however, he lost possessions and dropped down the pecking order. “It will be tough seeing Ojo back in that team, he might be heading for the exit,” the website stated.
