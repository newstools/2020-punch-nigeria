Adelani Adepegba, Abuja A non-governmental organisation, Regional Sustainable Energy Centre for Excellence for Sub-Saharan Africa, has said it is collaborating with the 774 local government areas in the country to carry out intervention projects in water, health, education and entrepreneurship training at the grass-roots level. RSECESSA Chairman, Alhaji Musbahu Mohammed, said the four areas of intervention were aimed at reducing poverty and diseases, adding that it was meant to assist the country in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals. Speaking at a conference with the Association of Local Government of Nigeria in Abuja on Tuesday, Mohammed said the project involved the reconstruction of classrooms in all the LGAs. According to him, the intervention would also make it easy for the LGAs to have access to grants under a conditional partnership agreement where they would contribute 3 per cent counterpart contribution to the execution of the project. Executive Director, RSECESSA, Ibrahim Trader, said the grant scheme was contingent on adherence to specific criteria and guidelines. He said, “The programme strategy also involves providing educational materials to schools, construction of a model science school in every LGA, including dispensaries.” Copyright PUNCH.
