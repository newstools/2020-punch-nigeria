Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Federal Road Safety Corps, Bayelsa State Command, says it recorded 80 per cent  reduction in the  number  of road accidents  in the state last year. The state Sector Commander, FRSC, Ikechukwu Igwe, said this in  an interview with reporters  in Yenagoa on Monday. Igwe said  they recorded 16 road accidents with eight fatalities in 2019 as against the 59  in 2018. He  attributed the  drop  to the  public enlightenment campaign embarked upon by the corps. He  said, “The total number of injured people  in 2019 are 49, which was far less than that of  2018 when we had a  series of injuries  every month. In fact, we had about 25 in one month, especially in June, 2018. “Our regular medical outreach for drivers  made great impact. During the year, we carried out an eye checkups for drivers and we also checked them on high blood pressure as well as their blood sugar levels to know their health status.” Igwe further said they recorded only one road accident during the festive season.
