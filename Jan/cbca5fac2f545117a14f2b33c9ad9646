Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government currently incurs an average of N45.87 as subsidy on every litre of petrol consumed in Nigeria, as industry data obtained on Wednesday showed decline in global crude oil prices. According to figures from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency, the Federal Government through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation spent an average of N45.87/litre as subsidy in the first 10 days of 2020. The PPPRA is a Federal Government agency that regulates the prices of petroleum products, while NNPC is the sole importer of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, into Nigeria since over two years. The NNPC, however, has repeatedly classified its subsidy spending on petrol as under-recovery on the grounds that only the National Assembly has budgetary powers to approve subsidy. The PMS pricing templates from the PPPRA for January 2, 3, 6, 7, 9 and 10 put the Expected Open Market Price for a litre of petrol at N182.05, N182.28, N183.5, N179.5, N172.93 and N174.52 on the respective days. But the ex-depot price for collection of the commodity on each of the stated days remained N133.28 per litre. Findings showed that the difference between the EOMP and the EdPC for each of the identified days were N48.77, N49, N50.22, N46.32, N39.65 and N41.27, while their average stood at N45.87. It, therefore, indicated that the Federal Government, through its oil corporation, currently spends an average of about N45.87 on each litre of petrol consumed across the country. This came as additional industry data showed that crude prices dipped marginally on Wednesday, as both the cost of Brent, the crude on which Nigeriaâ€™s oil is priced, as well as commodities in the OPEC basket decreased in prices. Updated figures posted as of 3.35am Eastern Standard Time on Wednesday showed that Brent dropped by $0.16 to $64.33 per barrel. The commodity had traded for $64.49 per barrel the preceding day, after dropping from a high of about $70 per barrel few days ago. Crude grades in the OPEC basket also reduced in prices, as they lost $0.97 and fell to $66.07 per barrel. Oil grades in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries basket had traded at a higher price of $67.04 on Tuesday. Copyright PUNCH.
