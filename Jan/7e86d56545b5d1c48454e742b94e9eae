Hindi Livinus, Yola A High Court in Yola, Adamawa State, has sentenced the accountant in one of the orthodox churches in the state, Mr Ibrahim Aku, to 18 years imprisonment for defrauding the church of N15.5m. Aku, a long-serving member of the Ekliyisar Yanuwa’a Nigeria (Church of the Brethren in Nigeria), was convicted for committing the fraud between 2016 and 2018, according to court records. Aku’s trial before his conviction by a Yola High court, presided over by Justice Nathan Musa, followed the petition filed before the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission by the Secretary General of the Church, Rev. Dr Daniel Mbaya. Mbaya said the embezzled funds were part of contributions generated from church members’ offerings, donations and tithes.
