Tony Okafor,Awka A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressive Grand Alliance, Chief Damian Okolo, has said Nnewi, the hometown of the late Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu,  should produce the next   governor of Anambra State. He said by equity and fairness, the governor of the state in 2022 should come from the area. He said Ihiala, Aguata and Orumba areas in the Anambra South Senatorial District had at various times produced the governor of the state to the exclusion of Nnewi. He asked the people of Anambra State to look out for a home-grown politician  from Nnewi that would succeed  the incumbent governor  in 2022. Okolo stated this while addressing stakeholders of the party in Awka, the Anambra State capital. He said,  “It is noteworthy that Anambra people have agreed and decided that Anambra South Senatorial  District  should produce the next governor of the state. “The only time my town, Nnewi, tasted it was when Mrs Virgy Etiaba held forth when Peter Obi was impeached for three months. So, for equity and fair play, Nnewi should produce the next governor of the state, considering the fact that Aguata, Ihiala and Nnewi are the major planks of the zone.” Copyright PUNCH.
