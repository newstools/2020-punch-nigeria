A mother-of-two, 20, died just hours after complaining of chest pains on New Year’s Eve, the Daily Mail has reported. Jasmine Donkin – from Kent – told her partner Matt Cullen, 20, that she felt chest pains shortly after coming out of the bathroom on December 31. Ms Donkin — mother to Storm, one, and three-week-old Callie Grace — sat on the sofa while Mr Cullen called an ambulance. Eight paramedics performed three hours of CPR on her before she was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, Kent. There she was put in intensive care after medics did a CT scan, Kent Live reports. She tragically died just hours later after blood clots in her lungs had prevented oxygen reaching her brain. Mr Cullen described Ms Donkin – who he met when they were both just 15 – as ‘funny, caring, courageous and kind.’ He said, “I had big plans for this year. I was going to propose to her. I was also going to take us all abroad because she’d never been.” READ ALSO: Five die, nine injured in Lagos, Niger highway crashes Mr Cullen has set up a fundraiser to help cover the cost of Ms Donkin’s funeral.
