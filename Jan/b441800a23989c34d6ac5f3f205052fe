Eleven prisoners have died since the start of the year in Kinshasa’s biggest prison, staff and NGO sources said on Tuesday, blaming shortages of drugs and food. “We have recorded 11 deaths since January 1. The latest three died yesterday (Monday) because there were no medicines to treat them and their families lacked the resources,” an official at the Makala prison told AFP, asking not to be named. “Since last October, the state has disbursed no funds to supply the prison with medicines and food,” he added. Makala prison is the biggest in the Democratic of Republic of Congo’s capital, housing nearly 9,000 inmates in a colonial-era facility with an intended maximum capacity of 1,500, according to official figures.

Work is underway to renovate at least three wings of the large jail, but the activity has forced the prisoners to live in increasingly cramped, unhealthy circumstances. The onetime colonial prisons of DR Congo are hugely overcrowded and dilapidated. Surviving in appalling hygienic conditions, inmates are exposed to many diseases, malnutrition and dehydration. (AFP)
