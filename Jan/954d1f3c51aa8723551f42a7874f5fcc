Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi A former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has called on the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, to stop oppressing the southern Kaduna people. He said this at the 19th Prayer Summit of the Southern Kaduna Christian Leaders Association held at the new Township Stadium in Kafanchan, Jema’a Local Government Area of Kaduna State on Saturday. Fani-Kayode, who was the guest speaker at the summit, lamented that the Kaduna State Government had refused to empower and develop the southern Kaduna area. The former minister said, “El-Rufai, I want to say this to you, that you need to stop the marginalisation of the southern Kaduna people. El-Rufai, I say this to you, stop oppressing Southern Kaduna people. “El-Rufai, I say this to you, ensure equitable distribution of resources, appointments, empowerment and development in Kaduna State. “Southern Kaduna people are not slaves. Southern Kaduna people are not second-class citizens.” Fani-Kayode, who was  represented by Rev. Emmanuel Olurunmoaba, charged the southern Kaduna people to be wary of alleged plans to take over their  land from them by changing the title of their traditional rulers to emirs. He said,  “If you allow them to succeed, they will impose strangers on you just as the Fulani are ruling in Ilorin, Kwara State, till today.” Copyright PUNCH.
