Ifeanyi Onuba The three tiers of government received a total allocation of N15.9tn from the federation account between January 2018 and December 2019. The figure was arrived at based on an analysis of the Federation Account Allocation Committee’s distribution to the three tiers of government for the two-year period. The committee, headed by the Minister of Finance, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, is made up of commissioners for finance from the 36 states of the federation, the Accountant General of the Federation, Mr Ahmed Idris, and representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. Others are representatives of the Federal Inland Revenue Service, the Nigeria Custom Service, Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission and the Central Bank of Nigeria. The federation account is currently being managed on a legal framework that allows funds to be shared under three major components – statutory allocation, Value Added Tax distribution, and allocation made under the derivation principle. Under statutory allocation, the Federal Government gets 52.68 per cent of the revenue shared; states, 26.72 per cent; and local governments, 20.60 per cent. The framework also provides that VAT revenue be shared thus: the FG, 15 per cent; states, 50 per cent; and the LGs, 35 per cent. Similarly, extra allocation is given to the nine oil producing states based on the 13 per cent derivation principle. A breakdown of the N15.9tn showed that while the sum of N7.7tn was distributed in 2018, the 2019 fiscal period saw an improved allocation totalling N8.2tn. A breakdown of the N7.71tn allocation for 2018 showed that the three tiers of government shared N655.17bn in January 2019. Out of this January amount, the Federal Government after deducting cost of collections to the revenue generating agencies received N278.73bn; states, N175.54bn, local governments, N132.48; while the sum of N51.74bn was paid to the oil producing states based on the 13 per cent derivation principle. In February 2018, allocation to the three tiers of government dropped to N635.55bn, out of which the Federal Government’s share was N263.28bn; states, N172.87bn and local governments, N129.98bn. In addition, the oil producing states received N52.04bn. However, in March, the allocation increased to N647.39bn. And from this, the Federal Government got N270.81bn; state governments, N173.76bn and local governments, N130.91bn while the oil producing states received additional N57.49bn.

The Chairman of Commissioners for Finance Forum at FAAC, David Olofu, stressed the need for innovative solutions to shore up revenue at a time the government was faced with challenges generating revenue. He said, “We would be focusing majorly on how we can improve the inflow in terms of revenue into the federation account so that the states can get more money to solve a lot of problems they are facing. “It’s not just for the states, even the Federal Government can get more money to solve a lot of problems we are facing as a nation. “We will be looking at our sources of revenue; the agencies responsible for generating these revenues, and we will be working together with them to ensure that whatever revenue that needs to come in is paid into the coffers of government.” He also said the committee would strengthen its peer review mechanism to ensure that states not doing well in revenue generation were assisted to boost their Internally Generated Revenue. Olofu said, “We will strengthen our peer review mechanisms and see how we can benchmark processes at the state level to make sure that we are not reinventing the wheels. “If there is success recorded somewhere and if it’s something that can easily be copied, then we will see how we can copy it and try to standardise processes across the states to make sure that we increase the IGR for the states because that will also enable them to do much more. “Apart from meeting recurrent expenditure, it will help them to engage in other capital development projects, which are key to making the states competitive.” Copyright PUNCH.
