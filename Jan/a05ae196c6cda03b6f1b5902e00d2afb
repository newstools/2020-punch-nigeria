Chairman of Nigerian Diaspora Commission, Mrs Abike Dabiri-Erewa, said remittances from Nigerians in the Diaspora amounted to 25 billion dollars in 2019, excluding informal remittances. According to her, Nigerians in diaspora believe they should be able to vote as they are remitting so much money to the country and contributing to the economy. She said that the commission would be engaging the National Assembly to look into the issue of diaspora voting. “We believe they deserve to vote. The parliament, we hope we can work with them to amend the relevant laws to make it possible for Nigerians in the diaspora to be able to vote.

Dabiri-Erewa disclosed that a Diaspora Policy for Nigeria has been sent to the Federal Executive Council for ratification. “The Diaspora policy is a holistic policy that actually will guide all diaspora engagements; it covers all aspects of diaspora engagements. “It will transcend virtually every ministry that has to do with diaspora; every department and agency,” she said. She expressed optimism that the document would be considered by the council in the New Year. “We have various engagements; we have sent the Diaspora Policy to the FEC; hopefully, it will be considered in the New Year. “We believe that if we are able to have this policy; it will actually revolutionarise a lot of things in this country,’’ she said.
