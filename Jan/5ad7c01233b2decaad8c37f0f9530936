One of them scaled the fence and made straight for the man, who was discussing with his wife and some of his children. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mathias Tyopev, said the command was aware of the incident and investigating it. “They started struggling with the intruder, who immediately brought out his gun and shot the man in the head. The other men also rushed in and used a log of wood to beat the man to ensure that he was dead before they made their escape. “Dafet was a primary school headmaster in the Barkin Ladi Local Government Area until he retired recently.
