Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti A National Assembly member, Senator Biodun Olujimi, on Wednesday, advocated collegiate leadership system for the Ekiti State chapter of Peoples Democratic Party.  This, she said, would enhance the party’s search for effective repositioning. Olujimi, who said “leadership is earned by hard work and commitment, not by fiat,” pledged to work with all leaders in the party to restore its lost glory in the state. The senator stated this in her New Year message entitled, “As 2019 rolled away, Ode to a New Year of promise.” She said, “Anything short of collegiate leadership will be a great disservice to our teeming party members, who are yearning for good, focussed and committed leadership.” Leadership crisis has polarised the PDP in the state along the lines of Olujimi and former Governor Ayodele Fayose. She said, “As the PDP state congress draws near, we must work together to install a strong, passionate, honest, vibrant, fair and committed party man, who will unite and not divide us as chairman. “Our sole agenda will be ‘Ekiti First, PDP next’. Any hidden agenda to perpetuate undemocratic and punitive tendencies will be resisted. “I urge that we all work together to restore the glory of our party because it is crystal clear that God will only install who He pleases. “I believe in the PDP and its ideals, yes there might be differences, but it’s the best party yet.” Copyright PUNCH.
