Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho is giving nothing away on a potential exit for Christian Eriksen but wants Kylian in the club. He said, “For us, we are very poor on news for two reasons. One, we are not buying a player every day and second because I am the kind of guy that refuses to speak about players from other clubs so any name you can throw at me, I will always say that player belongs to club A, B or C. “[On a potential link to PSG striker Edinson Cavani] I have a very good relationship with Mr Nasser and Mr Araujo, and I want to keep that relation. Good relations are based on respect and I’m not going to speak about players from Paris Saint-Germain. “Unless, as my friends, they could send [Kylian] Mbappe on loan. More than that, I have nothing to say!”
