Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri A member of the All Progressives Congress in Imo State, Franklin Ibeh, on Wednesday urged the people of the South East zone to embrace the ruling party because of the politics of 2023. Ibeh, who spoke to journalists in Owerri, the state capital, said rejecting the APC could cost the Igbo the “rare” opportunity of producing the next President of the country. He described as “good omen and welcome development” the defection of nine lawmakers of the Peoples Democratic Party, All Progressives Grand Alliance and Action Alliance to the APC on Tuesday in state House of Assembly. The APC chief said more Imo lawmakers and, by extension, South-East, should be encouraged to join the ruling party. He said the Igbo would only produce the President in 2023 by massively supporting and embracing the APC. Ibeh said contrary to the views of many, the APC was committed to handing over power to the Igbo in 2023. He said, “More people in the South East should be encouraged to embrace the APC. The ruling party is committed to handing over to the South-East, but that would be realised if our people embrace the ruling party wholeheartedly.”  Copyright PUNCH.
