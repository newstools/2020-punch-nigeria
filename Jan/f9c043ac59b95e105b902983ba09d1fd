Adelani Adepegba, Abuja Members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria and some youths on Monday protested the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and his aides in a drone airstrike by the United States. The Shi’ites burnt American flags at the Banex, Wuse area of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The angry protesters chanted hate songs and slogans such as ‘Death To America,’ as they condemned the US action. The sect members also demanded the release of their leader, Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat, who are currently in prison custody. Our correspondent also gathered that some Muslim youths blocked the Abuja-Keffi highway in protest against Soleimani’s killing causing serious traffic gridlock on the busy road. The unruly youths also paralyzed commercial activities in the Mararaba and Nyanya axis of the FCT as traders who feared an escalation of their action locked up their shops and fled. It was gathered that the youths were subsequently dispersed by security agencies after some time.  Shi’ites, others protest in FCT, burn US flag, block highway.

While noting that protest is an integral part of all civil democracies in the world, the council said the timing was wrong as it could lead to loss of lives. It said, “We appeal to these Muslim youths not to allow their emotions becloud them to the dangers of taking to the streets. “We appeal to the law enforcement agency to be alive to their responsibility of protecting lives and property.”
