The Head, Africa Region, International Professional Managers Association, United Kingdom, Prof Taiwo Feyi-Sobanjo, has said knowledge is a perishable asset that dies with time unless it is constantly relearned or renewed. He said, “It becomes compelling for top executives and decision makers, with or without considerable and significant experience in the workplace, to keep up to date with new ideas and to understand how other organisations have dealt with organisational problems and challenges. “In organisations with vast human and non-human resources and several diversified and complex stakeholders, the need for acquisition of advanced professional management knowledge for excellence performance is very important.” A statement issued on Tuesday by the association said Feyi-Sobanjo made the comment in a keynote address he delivered during the inauguration of the association’s chapter in Osogbo, Osun State. He added, “Advance professional management knowledge is very important because it emphasises practical usability of acquired knowledge in the work environment with experiences, competence and leadership capabilities that deliver impartial, professional and cost-effective interventions for organisation’s benefit.” On the new Osun chapter, he said the approval of the IPMA-UK branch in Osun State became necessary to “create easy access to its globally acclaimed professional programmes for all Nigerians and promote the welfare of its licensed members.” He said that typically, international professional bodies in the UK would not approve the establishment of state and branch councils outside the United Kingdom. “Osun State chapter is the first chapter to be launched in Nigeria due to the sustained pressure, request and sterling performances of Mr Akinola Abiola and the entire Osun team in this regard,” he added.
