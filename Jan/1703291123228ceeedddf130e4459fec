Feyisayo Popoola ADM Energy Plc has revealed plans to raise £150,360 by way of rights issue. The company said in a notice filed at the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday that it would issue 2,148,000 new ordinary shares of one penny each at a price of seven pence per share to Zark Capital Limited. It said following the issue of the new ordinary shares, Zark would hold 6,000,000 ordinary shares, representing 9.7 per cent of the company’s issued share capital. The notice read in part, “Application will shortly be made to the London Stock Exchange for the new ordinary shares, which will rank pari passu with the company’s existing ordinary shares. “The shares would be admitted to trading on AIM. Dealings in the new ordinary shares are expected to commence at 8.00 a.m. on or around January 13, 2020.” The company said the rights issue was the second stage of its fundraising programme. It said the first part of the fundraising was completed on November 12, 2019, where it raised £412,000. It later announced that a conditional fundraising would proceed to completion following shareholder approval at the company’s general meeting on the same day. It added, “While ADM raised approximately £412,000 in the fundraising, the completion of the fundraising in its entirety was delayed. “ADM confirms it has now completed, conditional upon admission, the final stage of the fundraising, raising £150,360 by way of the issue of 2,148,000 new ordinary shares of one penny each at a price of seven pence per share to Zark Capital Limited.” ADM said following the issue of the new ordinary shares, it would have 61,649,210 ordinary shares of one penny each in issue as there were no ordinary shares held in treasury. It stated that the figure of 61,649,210 might be used by the company’s shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they would determine if they were required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in the company under the Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.
