Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party has scheduled an emergency meeting of its National Executive Committee for Friday. This is coming 48 hours after the Supreme Court sacked Chief Emeka Ihedioha who was elected on the party’s platform as the governor of Imo State. The apex court had directed the Independent National Electoral Commission to withdraw the Certificate of Return it issued Ihedioha and issue a new one to Senator Hope Uzodinma of the ruling All Progressives Congress.
