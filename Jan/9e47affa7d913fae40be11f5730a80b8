Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad, on Sunday denied links with a former senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani, who is being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for alleged extortion. The complainant, Alhaji Sani Dauda, who reported Sani to the EFCC had claimed that the former senator demanded N4m from him to give to the CJN and four other judges to influence some pending cases in court. But the CJN, through a statement by the Supreme Court’s Director, Press and Information, Dr Festus Akande, described the claim as a blatant lie.
