The governor made the promise at the State Executive Council Strategic Retreat held in Ogere in the Ikenne Local Government Area of the state. Abiodun said the step would enable those who want to access land to site their companies to do so in less than 28 days. “We are working to ensure that land title deeds processing do not exceed 28 days. “This is to eliminate the trouble of accessing land and that will improve our ease of doing business ranking,” the governor said. He lamented the inability of the previous administrations to implement the Geographic Information System, noting that his administration would implement the system to enable it to plan and administer its land resources adequately. The governor said, “Land is to the state, what crude oil is to Nigeria.” He reiterated that his administration would stop at nothing in delivering 5,000 affordable housing units to the people.
