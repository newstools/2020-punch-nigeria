Matthew Ochei, Asaba Suspected hoodlums have reportedly killed Mr Mark Jidel, a security guard at the Noel Ojei Holdings Limited along the Asaba/Benin Expressway, by the Summit junction in Asaba, the Delta State capital. Southern City News learnt that the security guard, who was stabbed to death at his duty post on January 5, 2020, had over time complained that criminals frequently visited the company to vandalise its property. A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told our correspondent that on the day he was killed, Jidel was on night duty when the criminals invaded the company and stabbed him in the shoulder and inserted an iron into his body and covered the spilled blood with ashes. “It was a good Samaritan, Mr John Ifeokwu, who discovered the body the following morning and alerted the police,” the source said. He added that the security guard had been complaining about frequent attacks and vandalism of the company’s property to the management and his pastor because he was a dedicated Christian. Jidel’s corpse was said to have been deposited in the Federal Medical Centre mortuary by the management of the company, which also mobilised the police to swing into action to arrest the perpetrators. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, who confirmed the incident on Thursday, said investigation was ongoing to unravel the circumstance that led to the death of the guard. “For now, no arrest has been made, but I will find out the update from the division in charge of the area. Investigation is still ongoing and the command is intensifying efforts to arrest the hoodlums,” she stated. Copyright PUNCH.
