Sunday Aborisade,  Abuja The Senate has remained silent over the alleged conviction of one of its presiding officers for felony by a United States’ court in 1996. A coalition of nine civil society organisations had penultimate Monday alleged that the Deputy President of the Senate,  Ovie Omo- Agege, was convicted by a US court in 1996. The CSOs staged a demonstration at the office of the Department of State Service in Abuja on Friday following the expiration of its 72-hour ultimatum to Omo-Agege  to resign. They asked the DSS to investigate and prosecute the Deputy President of the Senate since his colleagues had refused to take any action. Attempts by our correspondent to get the official reaction of the Senate leadership to the matter have not been successful since Monday. Repeated calls made to the phone number of the Senate spokesperson, Godiya Akwashiki, were not answered. Akwashiki had also yet to reply the text message sent to him as of the time of filing this report. A principal officer of the Senate however told our correspondent on condition of anonymity on Tuesday that the Senate would not speak on the matter. He said, “What do you want the Senate to say?  The man has cleared himself of the allegation levelled against him. Let those who are protesting drag him to court.” But Omo-Agege, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yomi Odunuga, said the court did not convict him. Odunuga said, “For the umpteenth time, we would like to reiterate the fact that Senator Ovie Omo-Agege was cleared of all charges in the said case and he was never convicted in the USA as being alleged. “Till date, he travels freely to and within the country without any hint of harassment.” Copyright PUNCH.
