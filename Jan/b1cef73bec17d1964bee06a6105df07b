Tunde Oyekola Gunmen kidnapped three indigenes of Obbo-Aiyegunle in  the Ekiti local Government Area of Kwara State on New Year’s Eve. According to the former chairman of  the council, Chief Ezekiel Gbadeyan, two men and a woman travelling home for New Year were abducted by the hoodlums along Osi-Obbo-Aiyegunle road. According to sources, the fourth person escaped with serious injuries. It was learnt on Friday that the trio’s abductors   had  allegedly demanded  N50m from their families for their  release. Gbadeyan  lamented a spate of kidnappings in the area. He said,  “That  was the fourth in the last few weeks but hunters have always been  preventing innocent souls from being kidnapped. “The hunters have been our saving grace from the menace of these herders in the area. “These pathetic occurrences are due to the sorry  state of our road as vehicles cannot move freely. Therefore, we are appealing to the state government to assist us in rehabilitating the road. “Also, the road that links Obbo-Aiyegunle in Kwara  to Ekiti State is also awful. We use this medium to urge the authorities concerned to come to our rescue.” Spokesman for the police  in the state Ajayi Okasanmi confirmed the incident. “We are  working seriously to ensure the release of the victims from captivity,” he said.
