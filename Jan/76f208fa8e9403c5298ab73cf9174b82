Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State on Thursday signed the state’s N244.8bn 2020 budget into law. The budget tagged “Budget of Reflection and Progress” was aimed at ensuring continuation of the restoration agenda and policies of the administration. The News Agency of Nigeria quoted Masari as saying at the ceremony in Katsina that the state government would continue to ensure that its programmes impacted positively on the lives of the people within available resources. “We are for all people, including those in the opposition and those without parties. We will live up to our oath of office to provide governance to all,” he said. He urged members of the state House of Assembly to intensify efforts toward conducting oversight functions on government agencies with a view to ensuring judicious utilisation of resources. Masari also directed the ministries of Budget and Economic Planning, and that of Special Duties, to organise town hall meetings to sensitise the public on the budget. “People will know and understand what their needs are and if government can provide such needs. “Members of the state House of Assembly should also organise town hall meetings to get information on the needs of their constituents,” he said. NAN reports that N169.3bn, representing 69.17 per cent of the budget, is for capital expenditure, while N75.5bn, representing 30.83 per cent, is for recurrent expenditure. The Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Alhaji Tasiu Maigari, said the assembly slashed the budget to N244.8 bn from the N249.5 bn presented by the governor because the N4.5 bn was for N-Power and school feeding programme.
