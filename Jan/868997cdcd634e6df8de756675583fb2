The International Boxing Federation heavyweight clash between Anthony Joshua and Bulgarian boxer Kubrat Pulev will hold in Istanbul, Turkey in May. The date and venue of the fight were confirmed on Pulev’s official Facebook page. Pulev, 38 posted a link to an article that appears to claim that the much-anticipated fight will take place at the  Vodafone Arena – home of Turkish football club Besiktas. The pair are due to fight this year, with Pulev the mandatory challenger for Joshua’s IBF heavyweight title. But according to SunSport while talks are ongoing, any clash between the two boxers will only take place in either the United Kingdom, United States or Saudi Arabia.

Both boxers had been due to clash at Cardiff’s Principality Stadium back in October 2017, but Pulev had to pull out with injury and was replaced by Carlos Takam. Joshua is thought to be keen to return to London for his next fight. And it was revealed last month that the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium had emerged as a very real contender to host the bout.
