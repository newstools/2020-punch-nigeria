The National Parks Service says it is partnering a non-governmental organisation, Mothers of the International Foundation, on capacity building. The Conservator General, National Parks Service, Alhaji Ibrahim Goni, made this known when the foundation paid him a courtesy visit. According to EnviroNews Nigerian, the team, which was led by an ex-international footballer, Emmanuel Babayaro, solicited the partnership of the NPS towards its upcoming international conference with the theme, ‘The economic and social effects of women migration in Africa’. Goni said the theme of the conference was apt considering the present economic and social challenges associated with the contemporary society in the recent times. He also expressed the service’s interest to participate in the conference as well as the training for better and improved general performance. Goni said, “My service is doing a lot to reposition national parks in the country. “Every experience or knowledge gained will help to improve and strengthen our resolve to upgrade our services to international standards.” Babayaro said the purpose of the visit was to seek the NPS’ collaboration toward the foundation’s ‘Up skill human capital’ training. He said the training was to make the parks a tourist haven and for the development of the country at large. Babayaro said, “Our foundation is partnering many organisations like Geneva Academy for Peace that provide best of understanding and practical skills in peaceful conflict resolution, negotiation and other skills that allow one to interact better in a given environment. “Some of the training courses include sustainable development and human rights, effective leadership and conflict resolution and mediation.” He also suggested organising a football match that would comprise ex-international players at the park’s headquarters to further enhance publicity for the service, which the conservator general supported.
