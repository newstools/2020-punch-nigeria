PSG are plotting a huge contract offer for Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola. The Daily Express says PSG are ready to offer Guardiola a huge deal to leave City this summer. French champions PSG have been linked with a move for Guardiola in recent weeks and he is believed to be top of the club’s shortlist if they part company with current boss Thomas Tuchel. Guardiola is contracted to City until the end of next season, but there has been increasing speculation this season that this campaign could be his last at the club. He has insisted he is “100%” staying at the Etihad into next season – but PSG’s mega-rich owners are ready to make a huge offer to lure him away.
