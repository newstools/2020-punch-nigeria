Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt The was disagreement among stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State when they met in Port Harcourt on Sunday. The meeting, which began at about 3,45pm was aimed to chart a way forward for the party at the state level, which has been in crisis before the 2019 general election. Members of Rotimi Amaechi and Magnus Abe factions of the party sat together with others seen to be neutral as some of them expressed their mind over the challenges facing the state APC. Some of the stakeholders began to shout at each other few minutes after they told journalists to excuse them at the event that held at the Presidential Hotel in Port Harcourt. Former Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Otelemaba Amachree, appeared to have stormed out of the meeting while the exercise was still going. However, the convener of the meeting, Emmanuel Deeyah, insisted that nothing went wrong during the gathering. Earlier while journalists were observing, Chidi Nwihioka, said, “We are making one mistake as a family. When somebody does not behave well, I cannot call him a leader. As at now, there is no leader in (Rivers) APC,” Nwihioka said. Also, another APC stalwart in the state, Maurice Pronen, said he decided to be at the meeting to know whether it was for reconciliation or to leave the party. But Deeyah said,“We had a good meeting; we cannot resolve the issue in one day. “The issues in Rivers APC are self-inflicted. The problem in our party can be solved by us. Let us not take it elsewhere. The essence of this broad-based meeting is to reach a common ground. We will meet again,” Deeyah added. Copyright PUNCH.
