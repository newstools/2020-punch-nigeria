Rising star and UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya will look to defend his title for the first time this March against Yoel Romero, according to ESPN’s Brett Okamoto. Adesanya vs. Romero will be the main event of UFC 248 on March 7, 2020 in Las Vegas once contracts are signed. The undefeated 30-year-old won the title by second round knockout in a unification bout against Robert Whittaker last October, his seventh win in the UFC. Romero is an interesting choice as his first challenger given he has lost his last two fights and three of his last four. Paulo Costa was expected to get the shot, but is injured. Another upcoming card got a main event as former UFC welterweight champion, Tyron Woodley, will fight the surging Leon Edwards in the main event of UFC London on March 21, 2020  an ESPN+ show. Like Adesanya-Romero, the bout has yet to be officially signed. Woodley has been on the shelf since losing his title to Kamaru Usman last March, his first loss in five years. The 28-year-old Edwards, a winner of eight straight, has been calling for a big name and finally got one and in his home country.
