Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The International Committee of the Red Cross has received 10 victims of the Tuesday blast in Monguno, Borno State, for treatment. Head of ICRC delegation in Nigeria, Eloi Fillion, stated this in a tweet on the verified Twitter handle of the ICRC on Thursday. He tweeted, “My colleagues from @ICRC surgical team in #Maiduguri have just received 10 wounded people from last Tuesday attack in #Monguno. Five patients were evacuated by air, another five by road.” At least, three soldiers were killed in intense fighting between troops and Boko Haram insurgents around the key garrison town in the Lake Chad area. The soldiers died when an army vehicle burst into flames after a car filled with explosives rammed into a convoy on Tuesday, a source told AFP. PRNigeria also reported that a patrol was attacked near Monguno in Tuesday, but the patrol was quickly reinforced and the attack was repelled. “Though there were fewer casualties on the Nigerian troops through Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices, many Boko Haram terrorists were however eliminated during the encounter,” a source said.
