Oladimeji Ramon An anti-corruption advocacy group, Human and Environmental Development Agenda, has commended the Governor of Borno State, Prof. Babagana Zulum, for taking on bribe-taking soldiers on highways in the North-East. The governor had openly challenged some soldiers posted to Borno State to fight the Boko Haram insurgents but were seen on the road extorting money from motorists. In a statement on Thursday by its Chairman, Olanrewaju Suraju, HEDA hailed the Borno State governor for exposing the bribe-taking soldiers. The group said the incident had reinforced widespread public complaints about soldiers extorting locals in the troubled North-East. “We view this incidence with deep concern. When soldiers posted to protect the people begin to take bribe from the same people they are meant to protect, the implication is that such an armed institution will lose public confidence which will lead to loss of public support. When local cooperation is lost, there is no way the army can win the battle against terrorism. “We are monitoring the probe. We want to see the outcome of the probe. HEDA volunteers in the North-East have also been asked to monitor the activities of soldiers on the highways to see if extortion remains a pattern. If there are cases of further extortion, HEDA will surely pass on the information to the appropriate authorities,” the group said in the statement. Copyright PUNCH.
