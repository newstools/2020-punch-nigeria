Solape Lawal-Solarin Gunners starlet, Bukayo Saka, has been rated the eighth-most valuable teenager in the English Premier League according to Givemesports. Saka is valued at £11.7m. The 18-year-old has been a revelation at the Emirates ever since making his senior debut in 2018 against Vorskla Poltava in the Europa League. The England youth international is highly rated at the Emirates and has further proven his importance under new manager, Mikel Arteta. “There are plenty of things you can criticise Unai Emery for, but giving 17 appearances – rewarded with two goals – to one of Arsenal’s most exciting talents certainly isn’t one of them,” the report read. Tottenham Hotspur’ Ryan Sessegnon £31.5m, Chelsea’s Callum Hudson-Odoi £31.5m, Everton’s Moise Kean £28.8m, Manchester City’s Phil Foden £27m and Watford’s Joao Pedro completes the top five and he is valued at £18m.
