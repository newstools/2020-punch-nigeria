Success Nwogu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party on Wednesday said it would hold another meeting of its National Executive Committee on Monday next week. The party’s National General Secretary, Senator Umaru Tsauri, issued a notice of meeting in Abuja and explained that the NEC members would on the occasion discuss very critical issues affecting the nation. But sources within the party told our correspondent in Abuja that the PDP leaders would assess the protests embarked upon by the national leadership in Abuja on Monday and those of the state chapters of the party, and map out other strategies. The party had organised a series of protests against the judgment of the Supreme Court which sacked the 2019 Imo State governorship candidate of the PDP, Chief Emeka Ihedioha, and declared the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Hope Uzodinma, as governor of the state. The 2019 PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, had during the 87th NEC meeting said it had become necessary for them to mobilise Nigerians to resist the threat to the nation’s democracy, unity and development. According to him, the PDP and G34 fought and brought democracy to Nigeria. Atiku had said, “It is our duty to reincarnate the struggles they made that brought the democracy that the APC is enjoying. “Our party governed very well from 1999 up to 2015. As true democrats we conceded power to the opposition in the hope that it will further entrench democracy development and unity. But alas Nigerians have been proved wrong by the governing APC. “It has become very necessary for us to mobilise Nigeria to resist the threat to our democracy, unity and development.” Copyright PUNCH.
