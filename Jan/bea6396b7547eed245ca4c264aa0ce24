Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Chairman-nominee for the caretaker committee in Ipokia Local Government Area of Ogun State, Saibu Adeosun Mulero,  has been confirmed dead a few hours to his screening by the state House of Assembly.
Mulero was one of the Chairmen-nominees of the 20 local government transition committees in Ogun State appointed by Governor Dapo Abiodun last week. The deceased was expected to appear before the State House of Assembly Screening Committee on Wednesday for his confirmation but reportedly died a few hours to his screening. According to a close family source, he had already dressed up for a trip to Abeokuta to enable him to appear before the Assembly committee when he suddenly decided to take a short rest and could not wake up again. The Ogun State government in a statement issued by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Kunle Somorin, on Wednesday described the Committee Chairman-nominee’s death as shocking. The statement read, “He was such a diligent and resourceful grassroots politician whose skills and astuteness would have helped the people of Ippkia move to a higher level of development. “He will surely be missed by the party, APC, the good people of Ipokia LGA that he had plans to lead and the Dapo Abiodun administration would miss his envisaged contributions to our model of inclusive and participatory governance, which he was a disciple of. “Governor Dapo Abiodun prays that the good Lord will comfort his immediate family and grant his soul eternal rest in Aljanah Firdaous.”
The deceased was a graduate of Mass Communication from Ogun State Polytechnic now Moshood Abiola Polytechnic. He was a former Special Assistant and Senior Special Assistant to Ipokia Local Government Chairman, and a two-time supervisor in the local government. Adeosun was a member of the Ipokia Local Government Transition Committee in 2016 and a senior legislative aide in the National Assembly. He is survived by his wife, Mulikat Adeosun and three children.
