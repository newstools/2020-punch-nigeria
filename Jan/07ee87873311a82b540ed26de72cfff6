Oladimeji Ramon The Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, on Monday hailed the regional security outfit of the Southwestern States, code-named ‘Operation Amotekun’, saying it satisfied the yearnings of the people. Soyinka, while describing the security outfit inaugurated last week as “a desirable New Year gift,” said he had earlier given up on the political leadership of the region until the launch of the security outfit. The respected playwright spoke on Monday in Lagos at the “Never Again Conference” organised by the Nzuko Umunna and Ndigbo, to mark the 50 years after the Nigerian civil war.
