Everton striker Cenk Tosun has joined Crystal Palace on loan until the end of the season. The 28-year-old will be tasked with improving the team’s productivity in front of goal – despite lying ninth in the Premier League, they are the division’s second-lowest scorers this season. After sealing the deal, Palace chairman Steve Parish said, “We’re delighted to have secured Cenk’s services for the remainder of this season. “We’ve enjoyed a great first half of the campaign and Cenk’s arrival will bolster our squad as we push for a top-half Premier League finish. “Cenk has a proven record as a goal-scorer and we’ve admired him for some time, so I’m very pleased to welcome him to Crystal Palace.” As per Skysports, Tosun wanted more playing time as he bids to win back his place in Turkey’s squad ahead of the European Championships this summer. He joined Everton from Besiktas for £27m two years ago but has scored just 10 goals in 51 appearances. Tosun’s arrival at Selhurst Park could see Connor Wickham join a Championship club on loan until the end of the season. He has struggled for fitness since joining Palace nearly five years ago, playing just 48 times.
