Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution has sanctioned a senior researcher in its employ, Moses Akangbe, for exposing the activities of randy security agents deployed to maintain law and order in the border communities. Akangbe got into trouble for stating that the security agents were impregnating teenagers in border communities and compounding the situation there. He reportedly stated this at Oke-Odan, a border community in the Yewa South Local Government Area of Ogun State, while on an official assignment. But the IPCR Director-General, Dr Bakut Bakut, disassociated the institute from Akangbe’s utterances, insisting that it was his personal opinion and did not reflect the official position of the agency. The IPCR Head of Media, Mr Musa Mato, in a statement in Abuja on Sunday, called on the public to disregard the statement attributed to the officer. Bakut said, “It must be emphasised that the officer who made such an unverified claim has been sanctioned accordingly by the institute for the misrepresentation. “It is part of the IPCR mandate to interact with communities and explain the importance of peace in society, however, expression of personal opinion at public fora is seriously frowned upon by  the institute. “The Director-General of the institute has, therefore, called on the general public to disregard the information as it does not represent the official position of the institute.” Copyright PUNCH.
