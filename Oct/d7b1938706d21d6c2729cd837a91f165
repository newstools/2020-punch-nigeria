Kayode Oyero The Senior Pastor of the Covenant Christian Centre, Lagos, Pastor Poju Oyemade, has urged youths demonstrating against police brutality and extrajudicial killings to “organise for political power” so as to effect meaningful changes. The moderator of The Platform, an annual conference organised by the church to commemorate Nigeria’s independence on every October 1, said the “streets has its limit”. The cleric wrote on his Twitter handle, @pastorpoju, on Monday, “Why did President (Barack) Obama go into politics, seeking to be in office? He realised as a community organiser he was limited to what changes he could effect without political power. “The streets has its limit. To effect meaningful change peacefully organise for political power.” Oyemade had said the demands of the protesters were valid while narrating his wife’s ordeal in the hands of the operatives of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, appealed to the #EndSARS protesters to leave the roads and embrace dialogue. The #EndSARS protests rocking the country have continued for almost two weeks with youths calling for a lasting reform of the Nigeria Police Force. Major highways have been blocked by the youths, thereby, causing gridlock and affecting economic activities. Suspected hoodlums had also hijacked the #EndSARS campaign in some cities, wreaked havoc on citizens and vandalised public assets in Lagos, Benin, Abuja, amongst other major cities.
