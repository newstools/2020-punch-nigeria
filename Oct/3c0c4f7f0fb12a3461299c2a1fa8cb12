Sunday Aborisade, Abuja A former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to institute the state police, without further delay. Ekweremadu in a statement on, Wednesday, said state police was the lasting solution to the impunity and shortcomings that Buhari is currently trying to fix in the Nigeria Police Force. He regretted that the bill to amend the constitution to create state police, which he sponsored in the 8th Senate as well as the current Senate, had not received the required political support. Reacting to the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad and proposed setting up of the Special Weapons and Tactical Team, Ekweremadu said the Federal Government was still addressing the symptoms rather than the real illness. He said, “The ongoing street protests over the excesses of elements in the Nigeria Police did not come to me as a surprise. “As a matter of fact, I had always known, and warn severally that a day would come when Nigerians would no longer tolerate the worsening insecurity in the land and the excesses of those charged with protecting lives and property. “The problem with our policing and the attendant insecurity and excesses are engraved in Section 214 (1) of the 1999 constitution. “It reads, ‘There shall be a police force for Nigeria, which shall be known as the Nigeria Police Force, and subject to the provisions of this section, no other police force shall be established for the Federation or any part thereof’.

It has never worked anywhere. It is not working here and it will never work. “Therefore, whether we call it SARS or SWAT, we will only be addressing the symptoms instead of the diseases until we decentralise policing to allow citizens and the states take charge of the security of lives and properties of its people. “This is the more reassuring way of addressing the mounting challenges of corruption, excesses, indiscipline, abuse, inadequate and poorly-motivated manpower as well as lack of equipment and security infrastructure currently bedevilling policing in Nigeria,” he stated. The lawmaker added that one of the lessons from the #EndSARS protests was that Nigerians could always engender the changes they desired if they acted as one.
