MOBOLA SADIQ The Chairman of Nigerian Economic Summit Group, Mr Asue Ighodalo, has described the launch of the United Nations Water Mandate in Nigeria as a significant milestone for the NESG. Ighodalo, in a statement titled ‘UN CEO Water Mandate launched in Nigeria, hosted by the NESG’ and made available to Sunday PUNCH on Saturday, said the initiative underscored the mission of the economic summit group’s mission to be an enabling platform for mobilising the private sector to tackle challenging economic and social issues confronting the nation. The launch of the United Nations CEO Water Mandate in Nigeria, was hosted by the NESG, as part of pre-summit events leading up to the 26th Nigerian Economic Summit to galvanise the private sector to actively commit to improving water resources management for sustainable use for businesses and individual consumption, according to the statement. Ighodalo said the mandate was a UN Global Compact initiative that mobilised business leaders on water, sanitation and sustainable development goals. He added that Nigeria was ranked as an economic water-scarce country due to inadequate investments over time in the development and management of available water resources for social, economic and environmental needs. Also speaking, an official from the Federal Minister for Water Resources, Mr Suleiman Adamu, said there had been a decline in investment of water supply infrastructure by the state governments, adding that there was the need for private sector participation.
