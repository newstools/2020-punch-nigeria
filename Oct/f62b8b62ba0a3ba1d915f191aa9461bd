Wale Oyewale, Ibadan A trader, identified simply as Funmilola Adekoya, reportedly lost her three-month-old pregnancy following alleged brutality by some security agents in Ibadan. Adekoya, mother of one, lost her pregnancy after an unidentified security operative used an electrical gadget on her. The woman was said to have been attacked on September 29, at Floor 2, Gbangbalolonwa Complex, Idi-Ope, Imonlefalafia, Ibadan. Francis, the victim’s husband, said, “When the men who were guarded by two NSCDC operatives entered the shop, they claimed to have come for N2,000 tax for the Oyo State Board of Internal Revenue.” The woman said, “I made them understand that I had not made any sales that morning. Besides, there was no notice of their coming and so I did not prepare. “I pleaded with the tax collectors to give me till afternoon before paying the money but they threatened to apply force. “One of the NSCDC operative later dragged me out of the shop and touched me with an electrical gadget and then sprayed a gaseous substance on me.” The Public Relation Officer of NSCDC in Oyo State, Mr Oluwole Olusegun, said the matter was being investigated.
