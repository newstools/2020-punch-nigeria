The defectors, who were led by the state chairperson of the ADC, Tokunbo Adetoro, were received to the APC by the party chairman, Ade Adetimehin, on Saturday, at the party secretariat, in Akure, the state capital. The defectors promised to work with the APC to ensure that the candidate of the party, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, win the forthcoming governorship poll. Welcoming the defectors to the APC, Adetimehin commended them for taking what he called “the right step in the right direction”. He expressed confidence that their association with the APC would further boost the chances of the ruling party at the poll. On her part, Adetoro said the decision to collapse the ADC structure for the ruling party was informed by the performance of the Akeredolu-led government across the state.
