Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has commiserated with residents of Baruwa area in Lagos on the gas plant fire incident that ravaged the community on Thursday. It, however, said in a statement issued in Abuja by its spokesperson, Kennie Obateru, that NNPCâ€™s pipelines were not anywhere close to the location of the incident. The fire incident came barely a few weeks after a similar incident occurred at Iju Ishaga area of the state. On the Thursday incident, the NNPC said it swiftly mobilised its health, safety and environment team, in collaboration with other relevant agencies of Lagos State Government to bring the situation under control. It called on operators of gas plants and other petroleum products facilities across the country to ensure strict adherence to safety rules and regulations. The oil firm said operators should abide by stipulated rules in order to avoid similar incidents and the loss of lives. Copyright PUNCH.
