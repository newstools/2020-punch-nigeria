Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin A 67-year-old man, Abraham Olayinka,  has been rescued after jumping into Asa River on Abdulwahab Folawiyo, Unity Road, Ilorin, Kwara State. PUNCH Metro gathered that the incident occurred around 11.30am on Monday. Traders within the vicinity, who saw him jump into the river, reportedly drew the attention of security men around the area to the incident. Our correspondent learnt that a commercial motorcyclist, Mohammad Abubakar, in response to the call for help, jumped into the river together with some fishermen. They were said to have rescued the victim from the river. The Head of Media and Publicity of the Kwara State Fire Service, Hassan Adekunle, who said the victim was rescued before firemen arrived at the scene, said Olayinka was unstable when he was first brought out from the water. He, however, said the sexagenarian was revived and taken to a hospital where he was stabilised. Adekunle said the victim refused to state the reason for attempting suicide despite the pressure mounted on him by the fire service. However, PUNCH Metro gathered from some residents that Olayinka recently lamented about losing N30,000 to some thieves and that the money belonged to a friend. The commercial motorcyclist who rescued him, Abubakar, said, “I was riding along this area when I saw people gathering around the river bridge. I decided to stop to see what was actually going on, and I was told the old man jumped into the river and there was nobody to help him. “When I discovered that the old man was still breathing, I waited for a moment to get police permission to rescue him and I immediately jumped into the river.” Copyright PUNCH.
