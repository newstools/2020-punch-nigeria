Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna ONE of the contestants for the Zazzau Emirate stool, Bashir Aminu, the Iyan Zazzau, on Monday dragged the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, and nine others before the court over the appointment of Ahmed Bamali as the new Emir of Zazzau. The Iyan Zazzau, who was among those selected earlier by the Zazzau kingmakers, having scored the highest marks to succeed the late Shehu Idris, instituted a suit to challenge the process that led to the emergence of the new emir, a former Nigerian Ambassador to Thailand. Among the criteria to be considered by kingmakers were that the new emir must be learned both in western and Islamic education, vast in the history, tradition and custom of the emirate as well as being acceptable by the people. But the governor set aside the recommendations of the kingmakers and appointed Bamali as the new Emir. According to the suit filed at the Kaduna State High Court, the Iyan Zazzau, sought the court to declare him the emir, having scored the highest votes cast by the kingmakers. In the document made available to newsmen in Kaduna, the Iyan Zazzau sought among other orders, “a declaration that the plaintiff is still the Emir of Zazzau and is entitled to all rights and privileges pertaining thereto. “An order setting aside the purported appointment of the 10th defendant, Ambassador Ahmad Nuhu Bamalli, as the Emir of Zazzau; an injunction restraining the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th defendants from acting in the installation of the 10th defendant to the throne of the Emir of Zazzau or presenting to the 10th defendant with the staff of office until the final determination of this suit.” Copyright PUNCH.
