Osun State says the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission has scored it high in the area of fiscal transparency and accountability. It disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday entitled ‘Transparency: RMAFC scores Osun high.’ The statement said RMAFC Federal Commissioner, Alhaji Abdulahi Yaman, spoke for the commission during a two-day sensitisation and data-gathering tour to Osun, while meeting stakeholders in the finance, health and education sectors of the state. It said the tour, which would take the commission to the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, was being undertaken because of the need to regularly review the allocation formulae and principles to conform to changing economic realities. The statement quoted Yaman as saying Osun was better placed for great things because the state governor was doing very well in the area of fiscal transparency and accountability, which he said was the reason for excellent performances of the governor. He said, “As we were entering the state, we could see that the governor here is doing really well. “Apart from roads that are being constructed, we saw good-looking hospitals and schools, which are critical areas any responsible government must not take for granted. “Osun is better placed and ready for great things because you have a governor who has done well in the area of fiscal transparency and accountability.”
