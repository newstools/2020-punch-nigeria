Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja. The ravaging flood in Kogi has assumed a new dimension as the entire Assembly quarters have been flooded, forcing members to vacate their houses overnight. Also, several roads have been cut off, making it impossible for motorists and people to cross to other parts of the state. The Assembly quarters, located along Ganaja village, had been housing the 26 state lawmakers since 2003 until now, when the flood forced them out of their homes. Efforts to reach any of the Assembly members for comments proved abortive, as none of them picked their calls. They did not also respond to text massages sent by our correspondent as of press time. As of the time of filing this report on Sunday, no one could access Ganaja village without using a canoe or boat to cross the flooded area, forcing commuters to use another route to Lokoja and beyond. Our correspondent, who visited some affected areas on Sunday, including the flooded Assembly quarters, observed that no fewer than eight Assembly members could not use their official quarters due to the flood. It was also impossible to get to any of the flooded parts of the quarters. Copyright PUNCH.
