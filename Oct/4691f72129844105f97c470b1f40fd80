Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, has urged governors of the South-East to join the ruling All Progressives Congress. The group said it was apparent that the Peoples Democratic Party did not have the region’s best interests at heart, and as such, there was no need for leaders of the zone to continue to work  with the main opposition party. The zonal Secretary General of the group, Mr. Nnabuike Okwu, said this after a virtual meeting with leaders and other critical stakeholders of the region, on Monday. This call came barely 48 hours after speculations that the Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, had concluded plans to dump the PDP and take up membership of the APC. Okwu said “Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, after their consultative virtual meeting, with Igbo leaders and elders, on Monday, has been mandated to start mounting pressure on the South-East governors to abandon their political parties, especially those in the People’s Democratic Party, to join the mainstream ruling party, the All Progressive Congress, without further delay. “OYC urges the governors to defect, because there are no political benefits for the South-East to continue to remain in a political party that has no respect and value for Igbos, except milking their votes during elections through deceitful mediums and fake promises, and manipulative politicians.” Copyright PUNCH.
