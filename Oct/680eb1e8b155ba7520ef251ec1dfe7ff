Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt An inferno, which occurred at the old Port Harcourt township area of Rivers State, on Monday, left a woman and her baby critically burnt, while property worth millions of naira were also destroyed. Though the source of the fire could not be immediately ascertained, eyewitnesses said it might have resulted from the storage of petroleum products in one of the houses by a resident, even as they said the victims were rushed to the Rivers State University Teaching Hospital for treatment. It was learnt that the fire, which started around 9am, razed an entire building and several shops in the area before it was eventually extinguished by the personnel of the state fire service with the assistance of some youths in the area. One of the eyewitnesses, who gave his name simply as Peter, said several youths, who initially tried to extinguish the fire before the arrival of the fire fighters, suffered some burns, adding that no life was lost to the incident, but that several property were destroyed. He said, “The fire started around 9am; a woman and her baby inside the building that were severely burnt and have been rushed to the RSUTH; although their case was serious, they survived. “Many of us, who were fighting the fire from spreading, got burnt too; my right hand and face are hurting as we speak. The fire service people came and took over from us and extinguished the fire; we thank God for everything.” Efforts to get a reaction from the state Commissioner for Special Duties, Dr Thomas Bariere, were unsuccessful as he neither picked the several calls put across to his mobile phone nor replied to a text message sent to him by our correspondent as of the time of filing this report.
