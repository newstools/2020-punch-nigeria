Samson Folarin The Lagos State Government has empowered 200 heads of orphans and vulnerable children households with vocational tools as part of efforts to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 in the state. The state Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr Segun Dawodu, in a statement, said the tools would contribute to the financial independence of the families. He noted that the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the economic base of many families, adding that orphans and vulnerable households were the worst hit, hence the need for the intervention. The commissioner said the group was confronted with many challenges, including malnourishment, marginalisation and discrimination because of their conditions. “Hence, adequate care and protection should be given to them. Not having a means of economic sustainability does have a devastating emotional and financial effect on these vulnerable households,” he added. Dawodu stated that the government planned to increase support for the group by providing access to essential services such as food, health, education, among others. The Permanent Secretary, Mrs Yewande Falugba, stated that the support would increase the income of the families, as well as the wellbeing of the children. Copyright PUNCH.
