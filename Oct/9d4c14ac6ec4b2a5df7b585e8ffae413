Sodiq Oyeleke The Peoples Democratic Party, Lagos State Chapter has asked the immediate past governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, to retract his comments against the former Deputy National Chairman of PDP, Chief Bode George. Fayose had during the inauguration of the PDP Campaign Committee for the Lagos-East senatorial by-election last Tuesday asked PDP in Lagos State to send Bode George on “political retirement”. Failure to do this, Fayose said the party would neither make progress nor win elections in Lagos State.

He said this in a statement titled, ‘Keep your divisive advice, face your frustration’, on Sunday. Part of the statement read, “PDP, Lagos State chapter gives Fayose seven days ultimatum within which to retract and apologise for the deliberate unwarranted vituperation on all her elderly chieftains in the state chapter of the party. “Fayose will be declared persona non grata in all our indoor and outdoor activities from Monday, 12th October 2020, unless he, Fayose, purges himself of the grave nuisance value arising from the unsolicited, rabid and divisive advice. “We are nearing very important elections in the state to take us into winning Lagos State in 2023 general elections. We need togetherness and complimentary efforts possible of the old, young, male, female. “It is thus shocking that a supposed leader would come to our state to ‘tear’ us apart rather than give positive and progressively uniting advice to us. We will hold Fayose responsible for any future election loss in Lagos State and indeed the South-West.”
