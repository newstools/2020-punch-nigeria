Ebenezer Bajela and ’Tosin Oluwalowo Napoli striker Victor Osimhen is doubtful the Super Eagles’ friendly games against Algeria and Tunisia on October 9 and 13 respectively, in Austria, following COVID-19 restrictions put in place by his Italian club. Osimhen’s club Napoli announced on Saturday that COVID-19 tests were carried out on all their players, with only Macedonian midfielder Elif Elmas testing positive. However, ASL local health authority decided it was unsafe for the Napoli squad to travel and has banned the team from travelling outside the region to Turin for their Serie A clash at the Allianz Stadium on Sunday (today). Napoli later announced that their players and staff were in isolation and would not travel for their international fixtures. “Napoli players and staff are in voluntary home isolation. They will not leave for Turin, or to join up with their national teams,” Radio Kiss kiss, a Napoli-based radio station, tweeted. This means Eagles’ coach Gernot Rohr may likely consider another striking option in place of the 21-year-old Osimhen for the friendlies in Austria. Meanwhile team officials and backroom staff of the Eagles departed the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja on Saturday night for Austria, ahead of the games against their North African opponents. “We are on board and about to take off for the flight to Austria, where the players would join us,” Ibitoye told SUNDAY PUNCH on Saturday .
