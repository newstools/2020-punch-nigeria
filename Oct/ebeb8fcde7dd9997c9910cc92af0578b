Maiharaji Altine, Gusau A fresh crisis has engulfed the Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressive Congress barely two weeks to the bye-election into the vacant Bakura constituency seat in the state House of Assembly. A faction of the APC loyal to the immediate past governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari, named Bello Gamji as its candidate for the contest, a move which has since been opposed by party members loyal to Senator Kabiru Marafa. Addressing journalists in Gusau on Sunday, the Publicity Secretary of the Marafa-led faction, Alhaji Bello Bakyasuwa, while faulting the decision by the Yari-led faction to field a candidate, said, “Zamfara State APC is still in court; as such, it has no constitutional rights to present a candidate to contest the election.” Bakyasuwa rejected claims by the Yari-led faction that the Court of Appeal in Sokoto had set aside an earlier judgment given by the Zamfara State High Court. He said, “The court has only set aside the Zamfara State High Court judgment; but didn’t give the mantle of leadership of the party to any faction.” Copyright PUNCH.
