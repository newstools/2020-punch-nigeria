Adelani  Adepegba,Abuja Hundreds of #EndSARS protesters have barricaded the Kubwa-Zuba expressway, Abuja, grinding traffic to a halt on Saturday. While some of the campaigners blocked the Kubwa section of the expansive highway, close to the NNPC junction, others were said to have also blocked off the Gwarimpa section causing a serious traffic jam in the area. Our correspondent learnt that the activists had earlier passed through Gado Nasko Way, a major road in Kubwa, before taking over the highway. The youths blared music from their cars, danced and chanted slogans demanding police reforms, good governance, and a safer nation. The action has stranded motorists and commuters on the 10-lane highway for many hours. No security personnel was seen in the vicinity. This is happening less than 24 hours after the activists took over the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Road, Abuja, forcing residents living in that axis to spend the night in their vehicles. Many prospective travellers also missed their flights as the youths paralysed vehicular movement to and from the airport. A civil servant who lives in Lugbe, a satellite town along the airport road, Madam Janet, said she spent over 10 hours on the Airport road, adding that she got home around 12 am on Saturday. “The youths cleared the road for me when I explained that I was not feeling well. Despite their intervention, I didn’t get to my house till 12 am. A 10-minute trip from the office to my home took over 10 hours. My neighbour was not so lucky; she got home at past 1 am,” she narrated.
