Peter Dada and Abiodun Nejo Three days before the governorship election in Ondo State, the All Progressives Congress in the state has accused the Peoples Democratic Party of planning to rig the poll. The ruling party, in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Mr Alex Kalejaiye, alleged that the PDP was planning something criminal to be unveiled during election. According to the statement, the rigging plan was allegedly mastermind by Governor of Oyo State,  Seyi Makinde, who the APC alleged to have  recruited thousands of members of the PDP in Oyo State for the purpose of participating in the election. It reads partly, “The members of the Oyo State chapter of the PDP, with their voters cards are to vote in Ondo election, with the connivance of some staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission. The essence is to increase the PDP votes through the criminal angle. “While many of these ‘imported voters’ are already scattered in different local government areas of the state, more are expected on Friday. “ But the spokesperson for the Eyitayo Jegede Campaign Organisation, Mr Gbenga Akinmoyo, alleged that it was the APC that imported thugs from Ekiti State to disrupt the election on Saturday. Akinmoyo said, “Hoodlums are currently being loaded into commercial vehicles from Ado Ekiti motor parks as we speak. Security agencies should be vigilant and monitor vehicular movements into Ondo State. “This same activity has been happening with influxes from Kogi State and our organisation has given incessant notices on this. Let the security agencies be on top of their game please.” Copyright PUNCH.
