Chukwudi Akasike The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said it arrested a suspected cybercriminal (Yahoo boy), Adebayo Olawale; and his pastor, Gbenga Adesoju, a pastor in Ile-Ife, Osun State. The suspects were nabbed for allegedly defrauding one Umar Hayatu of Lafiya Quarters in Dukku Local Government Area of Gombe State to the tune of N12.7m. They were apprehended at Ile-Ife following a petition jointly written by the relatives of the victim (Umar Hayatu) and transferred to the EFCC Zonal Office on Thursday. Olawale and Adesoju were said to have conspired and defrauded their victim via social media platforms and phone calls under the pretence that he won a car, some expensive phones and offer of employment into a juicy position. “Adebayo, the prime suspect, contacted the victim several times, using fake Facebook account names; Williams Angellina and Omolola Adebayo and deceived the victim into believing that his parents have a company abroad and will make him (victim) the Nigerian Manager of the Company at Lagos. “The suspect further sent the victim various fake pictures of houses and cars that would be given to him as fringe benefits as soon as the company commences operation. He also promised him $US30,000 and expensive gifts such as iPhone and jewellery,” a statement on Saturday by EFCC’s Head of Media and Publicity, Wilson Uwujaren, read.
