Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested a suspected cult member over the death of an automobile technician, Salaudeen Lawal. The command also declared another suspected cultist, identified only as Bobo, wanted, over the killing. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this on Sunday in a statement. Oyeyemi explained that the deceased was called to fix a vehicle which developed a mechanical fault in the Igbesa area. According to the PPRO, in the course of fixing the vehicle, Bobo and his gang members accused the victim of obstructing the road. Oyeyemi said an argument later ensued, as Bobo allegedly broke a bottle and stabbed the victim in the hand. He said, “A distress call was made to the police at the Igbesa divisional headquarters and the DPO, SP Abayomi Adeniji, quickly led his men to the scene and rescued the victim to the hospital, where he gave up the ghost while receiving treatment. “The suspect, having realised what he did, fled immediately. But one of his accomplices was arrested and he is helping the police in their investigation.” The PPRO said the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, had ordered a manhunt for the suspect. Oyeyemi added that the commissioner had also directed that the case be taken over by the Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for discreet investigation.
