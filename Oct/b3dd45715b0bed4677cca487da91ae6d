Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt  Gunmen have abducted a worker of the Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State identified as Isubuzo McCarthy from his residence in Degema. It was learnt that the gunmen, numbering about seven, came in a speedboat from the riverside around 10.30am as the victim was preparing for work on Wednesday. The gunmen reportedly shot in the air to scare the residents, dragged Isubuzo out of the house and into their waiting boat, and whisked him off to an unknown destination. The victim’s younger brother, Ibisoma, who confirmed the incident to journalists in Port Harcourt, said the masked gunmen took his brother away through a nearby river in the area. According to him, the victim is a preacher of the gospel and not a troublemaker, and called on the police to step up their search to ensure his release, adding that the family had not heard from him or his abductors since the incident. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Nnamdi Omoni, confirmed the incident to our correspondent. “I can confirm that incident. However, the Commissioner of Police has ordered an investigation into the matter to ensure the victim’s release,” Omoni stated. Copyright PUNCH.
