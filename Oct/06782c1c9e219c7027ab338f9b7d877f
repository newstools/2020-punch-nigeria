John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party has said the re-appointment of Prof. Mahmood Yakubu as the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, has provided the commission another opportunity to redeem itself. This was contained in a statement titled, “INEC: PDP Charges Yakubu on Credible, Conclusive Elections,” signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, on Wednesday. Ologbondiyan said, “In the light of this five-year extension, our party hopes that the failures, disappointments and miscarriages that characterized the first five years tenure of Yakubu will have no place in the new order. “It is therefore instructive to state that with his re-appointment, Prof Yakubu has been given an ample time and opportunity to redeem himself, the image of the commission and preparation for credible, free and fair elections in our country. “At least, with this reappointment whatever happens in our future elections cannot be ascribed to inexperience and lack of adequate preparedness on the side of INEC. “Furthermore, we consider this reappointment by President Buhari as an impetus to demonstrate a readiness for a free fair and credible election, which Mr. President had always promised to bequeath at the end of his second and final term in office in 2023.” Copyright PUNCH.
