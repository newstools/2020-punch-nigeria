Bola Bamigbola, Akure Smart card reader failed to read Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate, Eyitayo Jegede’s card, on Saturday, and he was asked to step aside for other voters. Smart Card Reader could not also read the PVC of Eno, Jegede’s wife. The two of them have been asked to step aside for other voters. The machine had worked perfectly till when Jegede and the wife were to cast their vote. The PDP candidate and his wife had arrived at Ward 2, Polling Unit 10, Akure South Local Government, around 09:00am. The technical challenge was, however, resolved by the officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission present at the polling unit as Jegede and his wife were finally able to their cast votes. Jegede has Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, who is seeking reelection on the platform of the All Progressives Congress; and deputy governor, Agboola Ajayi, of the Zenith Labour Party, as major contenders in the poll. The PDP candidate, who lost to the incumbent in 2016, said God asked him to challenge Akeredolu again.
