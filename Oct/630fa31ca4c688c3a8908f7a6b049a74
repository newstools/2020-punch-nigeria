West Ham have signed Czech Republic defender Vladimir Coufal from Slavia Prague for a fee reported to be around £5 million ($6.5 million). The right-back has signed a contract with David Moyes’ side until 2023, with the option of a further two years. Capped eight times by his country, the 28-year-old joins his former Slavia and current national team-mate, Tomas Soucek, at the London Stadium. “I’m very happy I am part of the West Ham family,” Coufal said. “I will do everything so that West Ham will be successful. “I know about the interest West Ham had in me for a long time but now finally I am here and I am so happy.” Moyes said the club had been tracking the player for some time. “Vladimir fits the profile of the type of player we want to bring to the football club — hungry, ambitious, and determined,” he said. “He is a proven talent with Champions League and international experience, but we believe his best years are still ahead of him here at West Ham.” (AFP)
