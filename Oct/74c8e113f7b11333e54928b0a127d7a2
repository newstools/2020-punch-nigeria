Joseph Olaoluwa The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers has said it did not order the shutting down of fuel stations or oil installations. It also showed solidarity towards the ongoing protests against police brutality and the extortion, allegedly perpetrated by members of the now-disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad. According to a statement titled, ‘EndSARS: No organ of NUPENG ordered shutting down of fuel stations or oil installations,’ on Saturday, the union joined the call for police reforms. The statement signed by its National President and General Secretary, Williams Akporeha and Olamide Afolabi went ahead to empathise with all victims of police brutality. It read, “NUPENG stands with Nigerian youths against Police brutality and calls for immediate and far-reaching Police reforms as our members are as well victims of Police brutality and abuses through extortion, detention, harassment and intimidation nationwide. “Meanwhile, no organ of our Union has ordered shutting down of fuel stations or oil installations. “We sincerely empathize with all victims of police brutality including our members across the country and we peacefully join all well-meaning Nigerians to say police brutality must stop!” The #EndSARS protests have now stretched beyond a week, with aggrieved youths barricading major highways across the nation.
