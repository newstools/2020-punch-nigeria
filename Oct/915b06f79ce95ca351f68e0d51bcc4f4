Joseph Olaoluwa Aviation unions have threatened to go on strike in seven days over shortfalls in salary payments to workers of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria. In a letter addressed to the Managing Director of the FAAN, Capt. Rabiu Yadudu, the workers said the increasing delays and staggering of salary payment had become unbearable. The statement jointly signed by the National Union of Air Transports Employees, Air Transport Services Senior Association of Nigeria and Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals demanded full payment of all outstanding co-operatives funds, pensions, tax and allowances. Part of the statement read, “Management is hereby notified that if within seven days from the date of the notice all shortfalls in salary payments are not fully rectified and settled, our unions will commence an indefinite industrial action against the Authority. “For the avoidance of doubt, the salary issues include: full payment of all outstanding salaries; full remittances of all outstanding co-operative, pensions, tax, etc deductions; full payment of all outstanding allowances, grants, claims. “By this notice, all members nationwide are hereby directed to remain mobilised and ready for whatever actions that may be decided by the unions, should management fail to meet our demands as above listed.” Copyright PUNCH.
