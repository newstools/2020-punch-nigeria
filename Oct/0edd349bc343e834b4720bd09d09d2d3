John Alechenu, Abuja The Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress, on Tuesday, scored itself high while reviewing its activities since inauguration on June 22, 2020. The Chairman of the National Caretaker Committee, Mai Mala Buni, reeled out what his committee was able to achieve within the period in an address read on his behalf by the Secretary, Senator John AkpanUdoedehe. He spoke during the inauguration of the Reconciliation and Election Committee for Bayelsa Central and West Senatorial Districts’ Bye-election under the leadership of Gombe State Governor, Alhaji Mohammad Yahaya. Buni said, “You will all recall the ugly and unfortunate incidents that bedevilled our party, which threatened its existence and resulted in the dissolution of the National Working Committee and the emergence of the Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Committee, which I am privileged to chair. I am glad to state that the committee, upon assumption of office, engaged in genuine reconciliation to rebuild people’s confidence, trust and hope in the party. “Let me say with all sense of appreciation and fulfilment that the committee has in the last three months reconciled life-threatening challenges for the party in 11 states across the country. “Today, we proudly parade political heavyweights like the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara; former PDP National Chairman, Senator Barnabas Gemade; several members of the National Assembly; Chief Jimoh Ibrahim; former Head of Service of the Federation, Mr Danladi Kifasi; Senator Isa Hamma Misau; Alhaji Salisu Takai and several others, while many others have also indicated interest to join the party. “This was possible with the support the committee is enjoying from the stakeholders as we continue to move the party away from unnecessary wrangling, squabbles, and disputes.”
