The candidate of All Progressives Congress for senatorial bye-election in Lagos East, Mr. Tokunbo Abiru, on Wednesday urged the Federal Government to implement the presidential report on investigations into the activities of the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad. He also commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for granting the five-point demand of youths who protested the extrajudicial activities of the dissolved SARS. This was contained in a statement from the Tokunbo Abiru Campaign Media Office. He was quoted as canvassing for an “outright implementation of the 2,804-page report” as well as an amendment of the Nigeria Police Act. The candidate gave the advice at a meeting with residents of Agbowa, Ikosi-Ejirin Local Council Development Area. Abiru, a former Commissioner of Finance in Lagos State, was quoted as saying the IGP’s decision to dissolve the tactical squad “is just the first step in our search for a truly democratic, citizen-centred and community-oriented policing system.”
