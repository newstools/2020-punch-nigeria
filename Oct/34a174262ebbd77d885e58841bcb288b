Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A 24-year-old man, Felix Olayiwola, said to have been dismissed from the police, on Monday appeared before an Osun State Magistrates Court sitting in Osogbo for allegedly stealing a mobile phone and cash belonging to an applicant for police job. Appearing before Magistrate Modupe Awodele, the police prosecutor, John Idoko, said the defendant committed the offence on August 24, 2020 at about 8:30pm at Osun State Command headquarters of Nigeria Police Force in Osogbo. Idoko alleged that the defendant stole a bag belonging to Bolaji Ajiboye where he kept a Techno Camon 12 mobile phone valued N58,000. Also, in the bag stolen by the defendant was the sum of N25,000 belonging to Bolaji, said to be an applicant for police recruitment.
