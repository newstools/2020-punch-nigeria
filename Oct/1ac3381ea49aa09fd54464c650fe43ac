Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Federal Government has promised to engage other members of the World Trade Organisation to support the election of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the Director-General of the global body. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that the former Managing Director of the World Bank had secured the support of the majority of the WTO members with only the United States opposing her. The ministry in a statement on Thursday titled ‘Update on Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala’s aspiration to lead the World Trade Organisation’, issued by its spokesman, Ferdinand Nwonye, disclosed that a meeting of the General Council of the WTO had been scheduled for November 9, 2020, for the final decision on the election process. It said, “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to inform that the third and final round of the selection process of the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation was concluded on Tuesday, 27th October 2020 and the result was formally announced on Wednesday, 28th October 2020. “The candidate from Nigeria, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has secured the support of the majority of the member countries but is yet to be declared and returned the winner. “This is because apart from winning the election, all the 164 Member States of WTO were expected to adopt the winner by consensus, in accordance with the rule of procedure of the WTO. “It is important to highlight that Dr Okonjo-Iweala has secured cross-regional backing with only the United States opposing the consensus.” It added that Nigeria would continue to engage relevant stakeholders to ensure that the lofty aspiration of her candidate to lead the WTO was realised.
