Raphael Ede, Enugu The Independent National Electoral Commission, on Tuesday, announced its preparedness to conduct the Isi-Uzo State Constituency bye-election in Enugu State on Saturday, October 31, 2020. The state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr Emeka Ononamadu, who disclosed the readiness of the commission to conduct a free, fair and credible election, stated that it would also ensure the transparency of the process. According to Ononamadu, out of 72,289 registered voters in the constituency, 69,626 who have collected their Permanent Voter Cards will participate in the coming poll. The member representing the Isi-Uzo council area, Chijoke Ugwueze, had died during the COVID-19 lockdown. In July when Ugwueze was buried, the ruling Peoples Democratic Party announced that it would nominate his widow to replace him. But the opposition All Progressives Congress vowed to win the bye-election, saying that Ugwuezeâ€™s widow she should go and mourn her husband. The APC is fielding Mr MacDonald Okwor, who is the son of the traditional ruler of Ikem community and headquarters of the Isi-Uzo Local Government Council as its candidate for the election. Addressing journalists at the INEC state headquarters, Ononamadu said only 11 political parties would participate in poll. Copyright PUNCH.
