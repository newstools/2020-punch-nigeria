Tony Okafor, Awka No fewer than 13,000 tailors and other artisans in Anambra State are to benefit from the Artisan and Transport Support Scheme of the Federal Government. Under the programme, each beneficiary would receive a grant of between N30,000 and N50,000 to support their businesses. The funds would be disbursed by the Bank of Industry to individuals mainly tailors, cart pushers, barbers, plumbers, shoemakers, hairdressers, and electricians. At the town hall meeting with beneficiaries on Monday in Awka, Anambra State, a manager at BOI, Mr Monday Edirin, said the Federal Government approved the Nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan to cushion the effects of COVID -19 pandemic on the country’s economic activities. Edirin said an approval of 45 per cent for women and five percent for people with special needs were also provided under the scheme. He said, “We want the various associations and unions to take advantage and ownership of the scheme. It is absolutely free and you should not bribe anyone to benefit. Once you supply the bank details, your money will go directly into your bank accounts. “If you do not have bank account, this is the time to open one because this scheme is the Federal Government’s support for what COVID -19 has done to your businesses.” Anambra State focal person for the programme, Clement Chukwuka, observed that such category of persons were shut down and could not generate any income during the pandemic. He regretted that Anambra had not been able to fill its allotted quota in the scheme and urged those who participated at the town hall meeting to spread the information to their colleagues in all parts of the state to enable them apply.
