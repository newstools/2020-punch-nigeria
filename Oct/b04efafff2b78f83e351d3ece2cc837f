Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Oyo State Government has warned against reckless driving and illegal parking at clubs and other fun spots at night in view of the associated danger. The warning came as the Oyo State Road Traffic Management Authority impounded 10 vehicles at the weekend following the death of a resident who was reportedly hit by a drunk driver. The executive Chairman of OYRTMA, Akin Fagbemi, said the middle-aged man who was hit by the drunk driver at a popular club on Awolowo Way, Bodija in Ibadan, sustained head injuries. He said the victim, who was rushed to a nearby hospital late after the accident at midnight on Friday, gave up the ghost because of the delay caused by indiscriminate parking of vehicles at the club house. He urged the people to desist from causing obstruction on the roads by parking indiscriminately. “This administration will not condone destructive behaviours on the roads. We shall, henceforth, continue to enforce relevant sections of the extant traffic laws of the state against such vices,” Fagbemi added. Copyright PUNCH.
