Profit before tax of N1.36bn was achieved in the nine months in 2020 as against N1.81bn in 2019, amounting to a drop of 24.5 per cent and reflecting a decline of 850 basis points on Profit Before Tax margin due to the decline in operating profit. There was 40.6 per cent decline in net finance income due to lower investment income yields compared to the prior year. Revenue grew by 3.7 per cent year-on -year to N5.99bn in nine months 2020 from N5.78bn, on account of volume growth of 10.8 per cent year-on-year despite the COVID-19 related disruptions in April and May. In the first nine months of 2020, revenue improvement was driven by a strong Q3 performance, with revenue growth of 33.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter. Operating cash flow for the period was N285m in the first nine months of 2020, compared with N42m in the corresponding period in 2019. The company noted that it continued to maintain a strong cash position of N4.97bn with a 15 per cent growth in cash and cash equivalents between December 2019 and September 2020, which provided a buffer for operational requirements. Gross profit of N2.7bn was achieved in the nine-month period in 2020, reflecting a decline of 2.1 per cent year-on-year due to input cost escalation from supply chain disruptions, inflation and currency devaluation. Commenting on the performance, the Managing Director, David Wright, stated, “In the last quarter of 2019, CAP embarked on a new growth strategy focused on creating value for our shareholders and we are encouraged by the top line growth thus far. “CAP’s performance in 2020 has been affected by COVID-19, particularly in April and May as a result of the stringent movement restrictions, which constrained production and led to supply chain disruptions. “Despite the challenging operating environment, we achieved strong revenue and volume growth of 34 per cent and 34.6 per cent respectively in the third quarter of the year. “Going forward, we expect to continue to see the positive effects of our growth strategy on our sales and remain focused on managing operating costs to deliver on profit ambitions in the fourth quarter.” Copyright PUNCH.
