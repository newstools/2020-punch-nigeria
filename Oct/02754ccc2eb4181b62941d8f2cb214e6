John Alechenu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has said that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party lacks the moral authority to query the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), over his decision to remove petrol subsidy and compare fuel prices between Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, said this in a statement titled: ‘Reasons PDP has no moral authority to query PMB’s administration – APC’, in Abuja, on Sunday. He said it was baffling that the PDP had to be told that it did not have any moral authority to caution or query the regime. The statement read in part, “Between 2006 and 2013, PDP governments spent over N5.42tn on subsidy, which was 15.57 per cent higher than the 2014 national budget of N4.69tn. “It was also under the PDP government that the number of fuel importers rose from five in 2006 to 10 in 2007; 19 in 2008 and spiked up to 140 in 2011. This was one of the biggest causes of corruption, because many firms only existed on paper and collected subsidies on fuel that never existed. “The PDP has no genuine reason to cry wolf or display moral authority over subsidy under the Buhari administration.” When contacted for a response, the PDP spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, said, “I can’t respond to an impostor.” Copyright PUNCH.
