Peter Dada, Akure The Peoples Democratic Party has accused the All Progressives Congress of attacking its members in the Ifedore Local Government Area of the state. The Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr Kennedy Peretei, made the allegation on Tuesday in a statement, titled, ‘Akeredolu should allow peace to reign in Ondo State’. The statement read in part, “Since the declaration of the Ondo governorship election results, the All Progressives Congress thugs have stepped up their acts of recklessness and irresponsibility by attacking supporters of our party. “A particular case in point was the destruction of the PDP Secretariat and Eyitayo Jegede’s Campaign Office in Ijare, Ifedore LGA by APC thugs under the guise of celebrating the victory of Akeredolu. “Therefore, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu should try to live up to his   constitutional responsibility of protecting lives and property. It is very unfortunate that, the governor is feigning ignorance while his party thugs have been on rampage before the elections. Yet, this reign of terror has not abated even after the elections. Akeredolu should not set Ondo State on fire.” The state Chairman of the APC, Mr Ade Adetimehin, however, denied the allegations, saying the PDP was still suffering from defeat in the election. “There was nothing like that, I have not heard any report of such. Our members are still celebrating the victory peacefully across the state. No one engaged in violence. The PDP just came up with that allegation because they are still suffering from the defeat of the election.” Copyright PUNCH.
