Friday Olokor, Abuja Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere has pledged to resolve the dispute between Chief Ayo Adebanjo and former governor of Ogun State, Olusegun Osoba. National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin, said this in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja, on Monday. Odumakin said “Pa Adebanjo is the number two oldest Afenifere alive and Chief Osoba at 82, is not a young person. We can’t afford an open quarrel to last long among them. We will quench the fire and resolve this. We need peace in the house of Oduduwa. Whatever disagreement between them can be resolved.” Osoba had in a newspaper interview, accused Adebanjo of breaking Afenifere as well as urging the South-West to support Igbo presidency in 2023, among other issues. He also said Adebanjo accused him (Osoba) and others of selling out to the Fulani by supporting Muhammadu Buhari, forgetting that he also supported Abubakar Atiku, who’s also a Fulani. Responding in a separate interview, Adebanjo said, “At the appropriate time, I will put the record straight by telling my own side of the story. I will not dignify his (Osoba) statement with a response, because he only wanted to create an impression that he’s having a controversy with me.” Copyright PUNCH.
