Nike Popoola A professor of capital market at Nasarawa State University, Prof. Uche Uwaleke, has said the N50bn interest-free loan scheme of Access Bank for businesses affected by the end #EndSARS crisis is highly commendable. He also urged other banks to come up with such supportive initiatives. Access Bank Plc had disclosed plans to commence the disbursement of the N50bn interest-free loan and grant it set aside for its customers whose businesses were destroyed by hoodlums following the #EndSARS protests. Uwaleke said, “The move is quite exemplary and a demonstration of empathy on the part of the bank. “Other banks should borrow a leaf from this great show of corporate social responsibility. “Extending this kind of gesture in the form of reduced interest rate and moratorium to those who already borrowed money should equally be considered. “Much as the Central Bank of Nigeria has done a lot to cushion the impact of COVID-19 on small businesses, it can equally devise a way to encourage Access Bank and others that would eventually emulate this gesture.” There was no doubt that the implementation of this plan would be at a cost to the bank, he said. “This cost should be borne by the shareholders ultimately and not the customers by way of higher bank charges,” he said. He said it was the responsibility of the CBN to ensure that deposit money banks, as financial intermediaries, did not give with one hand and take with another. Copyright PUNCH.
