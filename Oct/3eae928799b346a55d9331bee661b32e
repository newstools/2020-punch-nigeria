John Alechenu, Abuja The National Chairman of the Action Democratic Party, Yabagi Sani, has dismissed speculations that the party has withdrawn from the Ondo State governorship race scheduled for Saturday, October 10. Sani accused the party’s detractors of sponsoring the speculations aimed at disenfranchising party supporters in an attempt to reduce the soaring chances of the party and its candidate. He said this at a press conference in Abuja, on Tuesday. The party chairman noted that it was a fact that the ADP was poised to win Saturday’s election, hence the attack from self-seeking “political jobbers.” Sani said, “I wish to draw your attention to a malicious statement sponsored by some self-seeking political jobbers, who purportedly reported that the ADP alongside nine other participating political parties has withdrawn from the governorship race in Ondo State to support the PDP candidate. “Our candidate, Prince Martin Kunle Olateru-Olagbegi, a loyal party member, patriotic Nigerian and an international figure, is still very much in the race to occupy the Oduduwa House, come 10th October, 2020 by the grace of God.”
