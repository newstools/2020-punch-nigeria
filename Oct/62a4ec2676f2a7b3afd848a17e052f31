KAYODE IDOWU Borno State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, has given N65 million to 8,000 widows and other people in critical humanitarian needs in the Nigerian border town of Rann. Rann, the headquarters of Kala-Balge Local Government Area of Borno State, shares border with Cameroon. The town can only be accessed by road through the Republic of Cameroon due to flooded roads from a dam discharge in Central Africa. The condition has trapped Nigerians in Rann, cutting them from traveling to other parts of Borno and denying them access to farms that are flooded. In a statement on Saturday by the governor’s media aide, Isa Gusau, Zulum had to fly in the needed money into Rann as the town was inaccessible by road through Nigeria and there was no bank through which the cash could be transferred. “The cash is to allow the people to buy food supplies from a border village in neighbouring Cameroon. “Zulum, during Saturday’s trip, the fifth since he became the governor of the troubled state last year, supervised the N65m cash distribution to families of 8,000 widows and some vulnerable residents,” it read. Each household in the community was reportedly given between N10,000 and N5,000 cash. Copyright PUNCH.
