Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Rivers State Government has denied that it ordered the reopening of primary schools in the state on October 12. The government, in a statement through the Permanent Secretary of the state Ministry of Education, Sir Chidi Adiele, said the information should be discountenanced. The statement reads partly, “That schools in the state resumed 5th October as approved by the State Executive Council. “That primary schools are exempted from reopening following expert medical advice. That the ministry shall make a formal announcement regarding the date when nursery and primary schools in the state will reopen.” “Under the Nigerian Constitution, every state of the federation is at liberty to run its schools. We urge parents and guardians not to take the viral fake news serious, as it is peddled by mischievous people.” Copyright PUNCH.
