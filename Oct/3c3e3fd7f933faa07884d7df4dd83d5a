Deji Lambo #EndSARS protesters in the Lekki area of Lagos State, on Saturday, arrested and handed over a co-protester, Yusuf Lawal, to the police for allegedly stealing a phone belonging to another protester. PUNCH Metro gathered that after Lawal stole the phone, he handed it over to an accomplice who absconded with it. However, Lawal was said to be unlucky as the protesters apprehended him before he could escape. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, said the protesters handed Lawal to the police, adding that efforts were on to arrest the fleeing member. He said, “The #EndSARS protesters at Lekki, arrested and handed over a co-protester, Yusuf Lawal, 25, from Ojuelegba area of Lagos, for stealing a phone, on Saturday, October 17, 2020. “The protesters who were angry about the incident descended on him and gave him beating before they agreed to hand him over to the police at the Maroko Police Station. “Though the stolen phone has not been recovered as the suspect passed on the phone to his fleeing gang members. The Police are working on the useful information gathered from him to track down his gang members who are at large. “The state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has reiterated that this incident is a clear indication that the protests, across the state, have been hijacked by some hoodlums who hide under the #EndSARS protests to steal, loot and cause damage to peoples property. “He, therefore, advised protesters to be watchful of those who have infiltrated into their gatherings to cause pains to innocent Lagosians.”
