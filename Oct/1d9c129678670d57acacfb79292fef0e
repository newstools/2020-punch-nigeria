Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The Kaduna State Chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria on Monday lamented the rising cases of drug abuse in the southern part of the state. The Christian body, while decrying the menace among the youths of the area, noted that drug and other related crimes had left the people of the area off guard in the face of bandits’ attacks. The State Chairman of CAN, Rev. Joseph Hayab, stated this during a victory praise and worship march in Kafanchan in the Jema’a Local Government Area of the state. According to Hayab, the menace of drug abuse was fast eating deep into the fabric of society, adding that swift and decisive action must be taken to arrest the trend. Hayab said, “CAN in Kaduna State is saying no to drug addiction and that is why we came to Kafanchan to speak to pastors, women and youths if there is anything they can do for us to overcome this because if you are in your senses when an enemy strikes, you will know how to react.

And that is why I am challenging pastors today. If you don’t speak against drugs, the problem will only get worse.”
