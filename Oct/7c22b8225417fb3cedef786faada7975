Peter Dada, Akure Flights were grounded in Akure Airport, Ondo State, on Monday as a crater was discovered dug on the runway on the airport. The crater was allegedly dug on the runway by some unknown persons suspected to be hoodlums. The development was said to have forced the management of the airport to close the runway, preventing flight from taking off or landing in the airport. To this end, many passengers who wanted to travel by air through the Akure Airports were unable to do so. An airport source said officials of the airport authority discovered the crater in the night and consequently closed the runway. The source said, “The hole was discovered during the early morning check by the security of the airport. We are yet to know those behind it. I think the intention of the miscreants was to cause plane crash in the airport. “The security operatives have been invited to see the place. The government has to deploy the security agents to the airport so as not to allow the miscreants cause havoc there.” Spokesperson of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria, Henrietta Yakubu, stated that cracks were discovered on the runway during the routine checks on Monday morning. She said the cracks had not affected flight operations in the airport. Yakubu added that repair works had commenced on the cracked portions of the runway. Copyright PUNCH.
