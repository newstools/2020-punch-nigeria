Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The family of late Dr Ferry Gberegbe, a lecturer at the Ken Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic, Bori, Rivers State, who was allegedly killed by operatives of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad, has reopened the murder case against the Nigeria Police. This is as the High Court sitting in Port Harcourt granted an ex parte order to serve the Inspector General of Police, the Police Service Commission and the Nigeria Police in the case involving the late Gberegbe who was allegedly shot by SARS operatives during the 2019 governorship election in the state. Widow of the slain lecturer, Ronke Gberegbe, is seeking N800m compensation for the death of her husband. During the court proceeding, Mrs Gberegbe’s lawyer, Lezina Amegwa, moved an application seeking the court to grant him leave to serve the IG, the PSC and the Nigeria Police the lead processes. The presiding judge, Justice Monima Danagogo, after granting the application, adjourned the matter to December 14, 2020 for hearing. Speaking with journalists outside the court room, Amegwa said, “Today, we have been able to reopen the case with respect to the murder of Dr Ferry Gberegbe. The claimant’s diseased wife was in court and the court, in its wisdom, has granted us the leave to serve outside jurisdiction the first, fourth and fifth defendant in the matter.” Copyright PUNCH.
