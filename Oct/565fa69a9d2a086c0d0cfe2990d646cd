Samson Folarin The Lagos State Police Command on Wednesday said hoodlums under the guise of participating in the #EndSARS protests killed two policemen in the state within two days. No fewer than 10 police divisions were also reported to have been attacked by the group. The affected police stations included Idimu, Igando, Layeni, Denton, Ilemba Hausa, Ajah, Amukoko, Ilasa and Cele Outpost. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Muyiwa Adejobi, in a statement, said two patrol vans were set ablaze in the Ojo and Ajegunle police divisions. “Similarly, the hoodlums attacked three new generation banks on Tuesday, October 20, and Wednesday, October 21, 2020, and carted away unspecified amount of money, while some parts of the banks were set on fire before they were dislodged. Some of them were arrested with the loots from the banks, including arms and ammunition. “In the Ajegunle area, they burnt the Secretariat of Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government Area and some valuables, including cars, and other private medical and commercial centres were attacked.
