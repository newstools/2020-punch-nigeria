Kelvin Ekerete Nigeria and Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, says his ambition is to one day win the African Footballer of The Year Award. The last Nigerian, who claimed the individual continental gong, was Nwankwo Kanu in 1999 (21 years ago) beating Ghana’s Samuel Kuffour and Ivory Coast’s Ibrahima Bakayoko. Osimhen, who recently joined Italian giants Napoli on an African record fee of €81m, has set his sights on bringing back the award to Nigeria. He disclosed this in a video posted by the club on Twitter. “My dream is to become the African Footballer of the Year, and I think I still have a long way to go in achieving that dream. I’m really working towards that direction and I think I’m on the right path. But as a man, it won’t be easy but I think having my own family (here) is a dream come true for me. “I have a long way to go, so, football is the only thing on my mind and I want to keep focusing, and of course, with my new club, a lot is expected of me so I’m here to deliver.” The former Lille man will face stiff competitions for the award from Liverpool’s duo, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, as well as Arsenal’s captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, and Manchester City’s Riyad Mahrez.
