Kayode Oyero Leke Adeboye, son of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, on Sunday, led an #EndSARS Service at the Lagos State Government House in Alausa, Ikeja. At the service attended by Christian faithful among youths demanding an end to police brutality and extrajudicial killings in the country, Leke charged his colleagues to be ready to take over the leadership of the nation. The cleric’s son also prayed to God to end all the ‘radarada – rubbish’ in the country. Leke wore a black top branded with the inscription; ‘My Bible Says These Are End Times, We Starting With #EndSARS’. He said, “This change that we have come for, let it be real change in Jesus’ name. This reformation, let it be real reformation in Jesus’ name. “Father, end all the radarada in our lives in Jesus’ name. End all the radarada in this nation in Jesus’ name. And Lord, please prepare us to be able to take over, to be able to take charge in Jesus’ name. “This is just the beginning of the first chapter. As we are writing the other chapters, please write it with us in Jesus’ name. “Soro soke, ko se amin.” The #EndSARS protests have been taking place across major cities in the country with youths demanding the reform of the Nigeria Police Force. Major highways across the country have been blocked thereby grounding economic activities. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Leke’s 78-year-old father endorsed the #EndSARS protests rocking the nation when he tweeted, “Our daughters will not be able to prophesy and young men will not see visions if we don’t keep them alive. “I support the youths in this peaceful protest as they “speak up” to #EndPoliceBrutality #EndSARS #ENDSWAT.” He had also called for the restructuring of the country at an event to mark Nigeria’s independence on October 3.
