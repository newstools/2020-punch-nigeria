The Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, on Tuesday, told the people of the state not to lower the credibility and reputation of the state, urging them to vote wisely on Saturday. Akeredolu, who spoke when his campaign train stormed his Owo country home, said Ondo People were known for intellectualism, brilliance, and intelligence of high magnitude, and therefore, must use their votes to sustain the reputation of the state as they perform their civic responsibility on Saturday. Akeredolu said if the calibre of people struggling to take over his position are factored into consideration, “the Saturday’s election is a battle between the Philosopher Kings (the Intellectuals) and the bush-league (the non-intellectuals and incompetent league)”. The governor said, “No investor will bring his money to invest in a state under the control and supervision of those who do not understand the language of investment. “One of my opponents, when he was Commissioner, was appointed to superintend over the Bitumen Exploration policy but the agency crumbled under him. It was under his watch that Dangote took our Refinery from Olokola Free Trade Zone in Ondo State to Epe in Lagos. Today, he is masquerading like a messiah. “We know the one that does not even know the meaning of INEC. We know the one who cannot stand before the people he’s seeking to govern to address them in our official language. Is that the person you want to vote to be representing you before the world? “Therefore, I appeal to you to vote wisely. I urge you to spread the message to your friends in other parts of our states. This election is a referendum between the bush-league who do not know what governance entails and the parlance of philosopher Kings that me, your son, Oluwarotimi, represent. We must not relegate our state.”
