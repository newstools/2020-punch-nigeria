Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has said the state government will ensure that lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic will help to build a resilient health care system. Fayemi, during the opening of a three-day health sector retreat in Ado-Ekiti, hailed the response to the pandemic by frontline health workers in the state. He said, “As a responsible government, we are integrating disease prevention and control with the delivery of quality and affordable services in our health care facilities, while improving governance and accountability is crucial to building back better health sector. “There is the need for us to sustain the momentum and ensure that all we have learned during this period is embedded into existing structures and most importantly, to build a resilient healthcare system,” he said, tasking healthcare providers to collaborate to move the health sector forward.” Fayemi added that his government was supporting and promoting the vision to take the health sector to the next level. The Commissioner for Health, Dr Oyebanji Filani, lauded Fayemi’s commitment to improved health care delivery in the state. “We need to reflect on the sort of health system we want to build and how we can work together to create a resilient and sustainable health system. “I look forward to a new vision for the sector that focuses on improving health outcomes and well-being for all residents of Ekiti State. We need to prioritise zero preventable deaths through advancing universal access to an explicit package of services and strengthening of the state’s epidemic preparedness and response capacity,” Filani said.
