Tukur Muntari, Kano A former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, has said he remains committed to promoting education in Kano as a demonstration of his past commitment towards uplifting the sector when he was in power. A statement by his media aide, Sanusi Dawakin-Tofa, on Wednesday, quoted Kwankwaso to have spoken during the commissioning of blocks of nomadic classrooms he built at Munture Village in the Rano Local Government Area of Kano State on Tuesday. Kwankwaso stated people living in remote towns and villages had become imperative for them to have a sense of belonging. He said the inauguration of the school was part of activities to commemorate his 64th birthday. He said with the classroom blocks children in the areas would be eager and willing to pursue western education. He said, “Our presence here today points to the fact that you people have not been forgotten. We are very much concerned with the issue of nomadic education. “These classroom blocks are meant to accommodate your children to prepare them for effective learning. Our intention is to bail them out of the bondage of ignorance and illiteracy.” He stressed the need for parents to ensure the enrolment of their children for nomadic education to be feasible. The classroom blocks are expected to accommodate 300 pupils. Copyright PUNCH.
