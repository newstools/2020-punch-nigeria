Gbenga Odogun Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, has denied bringing thugs to Ondo State for Saturday’s governorship election. This was in response to a statement released by the National Campaign Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party for Ondo 2020, alleging that the governor took thugs to Ondo State to rig the election. The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Onogwu Muhammed, on Saturday said, “It is not true. It can never be true. It is important to set the record straight and make it abundantly clear that the said statement is fake, unfounded, spurious, political motivated and a mere figment of the writer’s imagination aimed at tarnishing the good image of the governor and by extension, the good people of Kogi State. “It is also important to emphasise that His Excellency, Governor Yahaya Bello, who is a true democrat and firm believer in free and fair elections, harbours no thug and neither did he import any thug or thugs to Ondo State to rig or compromise the outcome of the forthcoming governorship election. “As a democrat who firmly believes in the sanctity of the ballot and has demonstrated that by getting re-elected in a free and fair election, he should not be dragged into public opprobrium through such a satanic post and spurious allegations.” The governor said rather than focusing on the election as expected of democrats, the PDP was spreading alleged misinformation. He, therefore, urged members of the public to disregard the said statement by the PDP National Campaign Committee for Ondo 2020. Copyright PUNCH.
