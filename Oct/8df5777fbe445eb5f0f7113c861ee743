Daud Olatunji,Abeokuta The Ogun State Police Command on Sunday denied the allegation that it killed three persons who were among those who protested against the death of a footballer in Sagamu, Tiamiyu Kazeem. The state Police Public Relations Offcier, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Sunday in a statement said a viral video ascribing the killing to the command was mischievous. Kazeem was reportedly killed by an operative of the zonal defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad, who threw him out of a moving operational vehicle on the Sagamu interchange after he was arrested. The PPRO said, “In the said video, the said individual displays the picture of retired DIG Peter Ogunyanwo, then  the DIG South-West,   sitting beside  Ogun State Governor,  Prince Dapo Abiodun,  during his condolence visit to the deceased family. “The said individual falsely claim that three other persons who were protesting against the killing of Tiamiyi Kazeem were also killed by an unidentified policeman on the day of the incident to the knowledge of the DIG.” Oyeyemi said the then DIG Ogunyanwo, an indigene of Sagamu, was in the state on the order of the  Inspector-General of Police. He added that he accompanied the state governor to the deceased’s family on condolence visit. Oyeyemi said, “It is therefore a thing of surprise for anyone to in anyway ascribe the killing of any protester to the DIG who came days after the whole incident.” Copyright PUNCH.
