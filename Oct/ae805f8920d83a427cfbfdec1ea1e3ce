Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Police Service Commission has appealed to policemen to return to work “in the spirit of nationalism.” The service said the government is working out protective programmes for them, stating that they should in the meantime continue with their responsibility of protecting the public space. The PSC again condemned the killing of policemen across the country, describing it as tragic. The commission spokesman, Ikechukwu Ani, said this in reaction to a report in Saturday PUNCH on the Public Service Rules which stipulates dismissal for any public officer who stayed away from work. The statement read in part, “The Police Service Commission had condemned the killing of police officers on legitimate duties and had warned that any attempt to make the country lawless will be an ill wind that will blow nobody any good. “The commission can only plead with the officers to in the spirit of nationalism to return to work while government works out enough protective programmes for them. “The commission will continue to do its best to ensure the police are motivated to do its job. “The commission being the employers of the Police is pained that policemen were killed and stations set ablaze throughout the country. “It will be very insensitive at this point for anyone to say that the commission will dismiss any policeman who didn’t return to work. “The commission was even at present mourning the deaths of its gallant officers as a result of the senseless killings.”
