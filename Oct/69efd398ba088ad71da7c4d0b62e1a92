Kayode Oyero The candidate of the Zenith Labour Party and deputy governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi, has lost his local government in the October 10 governorship poll in the state. Ajayi had won the Apoi Ward II, Unit 004, Idumado Quarters, Kiribo in the Ese Odo Local Government Area, with a wide margin having garnered 395 votes. His closest contestant and All Progressives Congress flagbearer, Rotimi Akeredolu, scored 13 votes while the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, secured five votes. But the deputy governor lost to his estranged boss and governor of the state at the local government level. Ajayi’s ZLP polled 4,760 votes while APC scored 13,383 votes leaving Peoples Democratic Party’s Eyitayo Jegede with 4,680 votes. The results were announced on Sunday afternoon by the Local Government collation officers at the Independent National Electoral Commission’s collation centre in Akure, the state capital. So far, all the results of the 18 local government areas in the state have been announced with the incumbent maintaining a comfortable lead having won over 14 LGAs. But INEC’s Returning Officer, Prof. Idowu Olayinka, is expected to announce the winner of the keenly contested poll which observers have described as a three-horse race between Akeredolu, Jegede and Ajayi.
