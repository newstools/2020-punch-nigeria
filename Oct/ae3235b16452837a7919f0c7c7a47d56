Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Osun State chapter of the All Progressives Congress and its Peoples Democratic Party counterpart on Monday engaged in a war of words over the violence which erupted while Governor Adegboyega Oyetola was addressing #EndSARS protesters in Osogbo last Saturday. The PDP, in a statement signed by its acting Chairman, Sunday Bisi, had urged Oyetola to apologise to the parents who lost their children. The PDP also blamed the violence on a supremacy battle between groups of hoodlums called “State Boys” who were nurtured by the APC. While commiserating with the governor over the assault on him, the PDP said, “We call on the state governor to set all necessary machineries in motion to track down the ‘State Boys’ who instigated the assault on his person that degenerated into the killing of the two Nigerians in Osogbo on Saturday. “We also demand the immediate arrest and prosecution of the trigger-happy guards involved in the killing of the innocent youths.” In response, the state Director of Publicity, Research and Strategy of the APC, Kunle Oyatomi, in a separate statement described claims by the PDP as “illogical, empty and far from the reality.” Oyatomi said, “It’s stupid to sell a dummy, and expecting that the good people of Osun will believe your cock and bull story that Oyetola sponsored hoodlums to attack himself.
