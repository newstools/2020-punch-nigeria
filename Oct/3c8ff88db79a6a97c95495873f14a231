Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Oyo State Government said on Thursday that it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Shell Nigeria Gas for the laying of gas pipeline infrastructure in the state. Governor Seyi Makinde, shortly after the signing of the MoU, said the partnership was an indication that the policies of his government would expand the economy of the state, adding that it had begun to yield positive results. Makinde, who described the project as timely, said it would aid the industrialisation drive embarked upon by the government. The gas pipeline infrastructure project is expected to be run on a build, operate and transfer basis for 15 years. “Oyo State is open for business and we try to transact our business transparently. We allow our decisions and actions to be driven by logic and data. So, we know for a fact that Shell Nigeria Gas coming here to extend the gas infrastructure to Oyo State is a decision that should have been taken a long time ago,” the governor said. He said he participated in the West Africa Gas Pipeline Project, adding, “If it is good for Ghana, it should be better for Oyo State.” The SNG’s Managing Director, Ed Ubong, who signed for the company, said the drive would help to expand the state’s economy. “Gas is the key to boosting industrialisation. I am proud that SNG is here. The vision of the governor is to see how we can rapidly industrialise the state and with a clear vision and support, we will get that done.” Copyright PUNCH.
