Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin Hoodlums had a field day on Saturday when they attacked a government warehouse on Medical Store Road, Uselu, and looted COVID-19 palliatives stored in the warehouse. The thugs, who had earlier in the morning, been prevented by military personnel from carrying out the act, succeeded in breaking the human shield mounted by the military and entered the store in their scores. No incident of shooting was recorded as the miscreants, mostly youths, carted away food items from the warehouse. Many, however, sustained varying degrees of injuries in the ensuing rush.
