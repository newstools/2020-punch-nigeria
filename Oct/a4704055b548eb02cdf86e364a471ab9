Sodiq Oyeleke The Lagos State Government has ordered an investigation into reports of “live ammunition fired at peaceful protesters” at the Lekki Toll Plaza Tuesday evening. Amnesty International had said the “excessive use of force” occasioned “deaths of protesters”. A statement from the State’s Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, quoted Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, as urging residents to remain calm. The statement was titled, ‘Lekki shooting: Lagos govt orders investigation’. It read in part, “There have been reports of shooting at the Lekki Toll Plaza, following the 24-hour curfew imposed on Lagos State to stop criminals who hid under the #EndSARS protests to unleash mayhem on innocent citizens. “The State Government has ordered an investigation into the incident. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has advised the security agents not to arrest anyone on account of the curfew, which he urges residents to observe for the peaceful atmosphere we all cherish. “He advises Lagosians to remain calm and not allow criminals, who have hijacked the noble protest of our gallant youths, to succeed in their evil plan of turning our dear state upside down.”
