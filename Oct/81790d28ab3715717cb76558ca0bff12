Peter Dada, Akure The Eyitayo Jegede Campaign Organisation on Wednesday raised the alarm over an alleged plot by the All Progressives Congress to snatch ballot boxes in order to rig Saturday’s Ondo State Governorship election. The alarm was contained in a statement titled, ‘APC plans to use fake INEC identity for ballot box snatching,’  issued by its  spokesman, Mr Gbenga Akinmoyo. It read in part, “It is one thing to sign a peace accord, but it is another thing to stick to the tenets of the agreement. We have received information that the APC has devised a system to circumvent the regulations laid down by INEC governing the conduct of the governorship election on Saturday. “We learnt from sources that they have rented unmarked Hilux vans and also acquired stickers that read, ‘On Electoral Duty,’ to be pasted on these vans. “The vans are to be used by hired thugs brought into Ondo State from various locations for the purpose of ballot box snatching. These allegations are also affirmed by a statement from a group, Human Rights Watch, which has gone viral on social media.” It appealed to relevant authorities to stop the devious plot. In response, the spokesman for the Akeredolu Campaign Organisation, Mr. Richard Olatunde said, “We don’t have any reason to go that low. It’s the failure staring the PDP in the face that’s creating this kind of jittery imagination. Governor Akeredolu has campaigned round the 18 local government areas of the state. He has also performed creditably well across the three Senatorial districts of the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
