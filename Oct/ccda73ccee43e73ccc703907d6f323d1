Wale Oyewale, Ibadan In view of the continued #EndSARS protests across the nation, the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, has urged protesters to allow the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to effect the reforms as promised in the wake of the nationwide protest. The monarch, in a statement made available to journalists by his Press Secretary, Alli Ibraheem, noted that the subsequent disbandment of the Special Anti Robbery Squad has given victory to the protesting youth. Citing the clash between the pro and anti-SARS groups in Osogbo, the Osun State capital on Thursday, the statement said the reform of the Nigeria Police Force would no longer be far-fetched as the President had expressed commitment to the demands of the protesters. Warning against the danger of possible hijack of the protests by criminal elements, the statement read, “The President, I know, is fair. The protesters have spoken and their voice is heard. The protesters have won. Already, the unit is banned and robust reform is expected to be in phases. “Your agitation is not limited to SARS but frustration occasioned by hardship. The hardship is not unconnected with the destruction of past years that chased many, including me, out of the country.

I belong to the masses. Let us endeavour to give the government an avenue to pronounce a new Police Act.”
