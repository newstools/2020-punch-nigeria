Hindi Livinus, Yola Hoodlums on Sunday attacked and looted a warehouse with COVID-19 palliatives at Kwana-Waya in Yola, the Adamawa State capital. It was gathered that other residents including the elderly, carted away food items from the warehouse. They could be heard shouting, in a viral video circulating on social media, that people should “come out for free shopping”. “Yola people, come out for free shopping,” indistinct voices beckoned, in one of the videos. Security personnel, who arrived at the scene, could not stop the breach of the warehouse because of the overwhelming number of people. The people looted cartoons of Indomie, bags of rice, and other food items. The Public Relations Officer, Adamawa State Police Command, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, confirmed the breach at the COVID-19 storehouse. He said the Commissioner of Police, Olugbenga Adeyanju, had dispatched a team of policemen to the scene. He said, “We heard that hundreds of people have gathered and are looting foodstuff at a storage facility in Kwana-waya. “We have mobilised policemen and (they) are on our way to the scene in order to restore peace and order in the area.”
