Ebenezer Bajela Media officer of the Super Eagles Toyin Ibitoye says officials and players of the national team were shocked after the Austrian government announced a change of venue for Friday’s international friendly against Algeria in Klagenfurt, on Thursday morning. The tie, initially slated for the Jacques Lemmans Arena, has now been moved to the 30,000 capacity Worthersee Stadium in Klagenfurt. Ibitoye said the venue change came as a shock to the Nigerian delegation, adding that no reason was given for the decision by the Austrian government. He said, “We were surprised ourselves when we heard about the change in venue and that the match had been moved to a bigger stadium. “I don’t know why the game was moved to another stadium but it doesn’t change anything because the game will still be played behind closed doors, so I don’t see any reason for it.”
