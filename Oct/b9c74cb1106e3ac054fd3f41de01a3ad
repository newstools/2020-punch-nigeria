Kayode Oyero The Federal Road Safety Corps on Friday ordered all its officers to ‘immediately resume’ operational activities in all formations of the Corps across the country. The Corps had earlier suspended all enforcement activities as a result of the unrest that trailed the #EndSARS protests in the country. Some offices of the Corps were also torched by rampaging hoodlums who hijacked the protests against police brutality to terrorise Nigerians including road users. But in a statement on Friday, FRSC Corps Marshal, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, ordered all the officers of the Corps to return to their duty posts. The statement titled, ‘Go Back To The Roads, Corps Marshal Orders Personnel, Mourns The Victims Of Enugu Crash,’ was signed by the Corps Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem.

Oyeyemi assured the personnel that everything humanly possible would be done to safeguard lives and properties. The FRSC boss also mourned the 21 victims who lost their lives in an auto crash in Enugu State on Wednesday.
