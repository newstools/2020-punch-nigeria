Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, has charged the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture to support the state $12m Cassava Processing Initiative aimed at job creation and food security. Wike who gave the charge during a meeting with the board of the Rivers Cassava Processing Company Limited at the Government House, Port Harcourt, said the initiative would also earn foreign exchange for the country. The governor in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, said the state government ought to enjoy the support of the CBN in its endeavour to boost food production. He further said that if Rivers Cassava Processing Company was encouraged, the countryâ€™s dependence on imported cassava products would drastically reduce. The governor regretted that the CBN had failed to accede to Rivers State Government request for N5bn to boost the agriculture in the state, saying if part of the N5bn was invested in cassava initiative, it would reduce unemployment rate.
