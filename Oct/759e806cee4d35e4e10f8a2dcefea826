Enyioha Opara, Minna No fewer than six vigilantes were reportedly killed in a renewed attack by bandits on Kagara in the Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State. The attack occurred around 7am on Monday when the bandits blocked Pandogari Road. A source told our correspondent that calls to the police went unanswered, leaving the vigilantes to face the bandits. PUNCH Metro learnt that the vigilantes took the corpses of their colleagues to the police divisional office in Kagara, where they started a protest. “They mobbed the police station, burgled the armory and went away with their ammunition. “They were angry that the police did not do anything concerning the attack or respond to calls for help, as they left only the vigilantes to battle with the bandits, which led to the death of some of their colleagues,” the source added. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Wasiu Abiodun, could not be reached for comment as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH.
