Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo THE member representing Karim-Lamido I State Constituency in the Taraba State House of Assembly and former Deputy Speaker, Charles Maijankai, on Sunday dismissed speculations about an alleged plot to impeach Governor Darius Ishaku and the Speaker of the House. In an interview with The PUNCH on Sunday, the lawmaker said nobody was interested in impeaching Ishaku or the leadership of the House. He said, “We are not interested in removing the governor and the leadership of the House, but some of us are not being treated fairly and I told the governor this. We were denied participation in the just concluded ward, local government and state congresses of our party and that is where our grievances are. “The plan is to destroy us politically, but we are resisting and that is why our supporters who bought forms but were denied participation in the congresses are now in court.” Copyright PUNCH.
