Sunday Aborisade, Abuja Former chairman of the board of Ondo State Radio-Vision Corporation, Dr. Kayode Ajulo, on Sunday attributed the defeat of Mr. Eyitayo Jegede in the Saturday’s governorship election to the faceoff between him and former governor Olusegun Mimiko. Jegede, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the election, served as a two-term attorney general and commissioner for Justice when Mimiko was governor for eight years. The relationship between the two of them went sour when Mimiko anointed Jegede as his successor in 2016 but allegedly refused to back it up with funds, which led to his defeat. Jegede also emerged as the candidate of the PDP in the 2020 governorship election but Mimiko, who has since dumped the party to form the Zenith Labour Party, pitched his tent with the incumbent Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, who contested on the platform of the ZLP. Reacting to the outcome of the election in a statement in Abuja, on Sunday, the Abuja- based lawyer, said “The People’s Democratic Party would have had a better shot at winning if the party’s candidate had emulated the tactic of the APC’s candidate who stoop to conquer by making peace with all his old and new adversaries.” Copyright PUNCH.
