Adelani Adepegba, Abuja Despite directives by the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, warning against deployment of force against peaceful protesters, policemen on Monday fired tear gas at #EndSARS campaigners in Abuja. The protesters who massed around the busy Keffi-Abuja Expressway around the Karu axis in the suburb of the nationâ€™s capital were violently dispersed by the armed policemen. The police officers, who emerged from under the Karu Bridge, chased the protesters away with horsewhips as they ran for cover in different directions. There were reports that a journalist was assaulted by the policemen.
