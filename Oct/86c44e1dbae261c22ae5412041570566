Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has recalled the suspended Chairman of Port Harcourt City Local Government, Victor Ihunwo after over nine weeks. Wike had suspended Ihunwo over illegal tax collection, even as the Association of Local Government of Nigeria in the State had appealed to the governor to recall its member. The development was contained in a statement issued by the Secretary to the State Government, Tammy Danagogo, in Port Harcourt on Monday. The governor in the statement warned the reinstated council boss to desist from engaging in illegal or double taxation and any activity that runs against public interest.
