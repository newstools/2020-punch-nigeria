ADA WODU The Cross River State Commissioner of Police, Abdulkadir Jimoh, has condemned mob lynching of three suspected kidnappers in the Akpabuyo Local Government Area of the state. The mob allegedly set ablaze the suspects on Saturday with a motorcycle conveying them. It was learnt that their heads were decapitated before they were set ablaze by the roadside. The incident attracted a huge crowd who watched as the suspects were burnt to death The Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, in a statement titled, ‘Jungle justice and its implications,’ condemned the incident. It read in part, “The attention of the Commissioner of Police, Cross River State Command, Abdulkadir Jimoh, has been drawn to the incessant mob action meted out to criminal elements across the state. It’s because of that, that the commissioner wishes to state unequivocally that no person or group of persons has the right to maim or take the life of another person irrespective of the offence committed. “Consequently, the ugly incident which occurred in the early hours of Saturday at Akpabuyo LGA, where three suspected criminals were allegedly set ablaze is barbaric and strongly condemned.” The command warned members of the public against taking the law into their own hands, adding that perpetrators when apprehended would face the law.
