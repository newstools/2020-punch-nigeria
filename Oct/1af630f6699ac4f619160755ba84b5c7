Sodiq Oyeleke Arsenal have sympathised with their fans in Nigeria over the crisis that followed the #EndSARS protests in the country. The club tweeted on Saturday that it had seen “the footage” and could not imagine the pain. Though the club did not state exactly which footage, hundreds of protesters were shot by soldiers in the country at the Lekki toll gate on Tuesday. The footage of the soldiers firing live ammunition at the protesters has since gone viral and attracted condemnations globally. While Amnesty International claimed that 10 persons allegedly died, an eyewitness, DJ Switch, said about 15 protesters died. The club tweeted, “To our Nigerian fans. We see you. We hear you. We feel you. We have read our replies. “We have seen the footage. We cannot imagine the pain. Our thoughts are with everyone in Nigeria
Stay strong. Stay safe.”  The tweet, however, attracted commendations from some Nigerians on Twitter. @PrinxHD replying to @Arsenal said, “We’re currently healing from the October 20th event, this will go a long way to facilitate that. Please win tomorrow.” @prettycachy added, “Thank you Arsenal for the moral support. The Nigerian government through the army (shot) innocent Nigerians who were singing the national anthem and waving the Flag of Nigeria at Lekki Toll Plaza on 20/10/20. We will never forget. #EndSARS”
