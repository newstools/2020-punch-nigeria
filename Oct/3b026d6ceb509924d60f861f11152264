TOPE OMOGBOLAGUN NECA’s Network of Entrepreneurial Women has called for the implementation of policies to make loans available and accessible to women in business, saying it would help them flourish as female entrepreneurs. The association’s President, Mrs Funmilayo Arowoogun, who spoke at a press conference on Friday to celebrate the 15th anniversary of NNEW in Lagos State, stated that one of the factors militating against female entrepreneurs was the issue of access to funds, especially loans. Arowoogun said, “A woman that is empowered and able to do her business well is an employer of labour. She helps to provide job security and also contributes to the Gross Domestic Product of the country, as well as reduces the gaps in employment margin.’’ The NNEW president noted that many women were doing their best and shattering glass ceilings. She, however, added that it would be better if the government came up with less strict rules for women in terms of getting loans. She said, “If the government at the federal and state levels could make access to funding especially loans easy for women by reducing the protocol involved in getting these funds, it would enable women to have flourishing businesses.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
