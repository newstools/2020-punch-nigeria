Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja A journalist with the Sun Newspaper, Emmanuel Adeyemi, has been shot. Adeyemi was on his way to the Nigerian Union of Journalists Secretariat when he was shot. The drive-by shooters also shot another passerby, whose identity could not be immediately ascertained. The passerby was said to have just arrived from Benue State and caught up in the middle of the incident. The gunshots in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital followed the resumption of looting in another warehouse in the Zone 8 area. A similar incident was recorded overnight when the ADP warehouse was invaded and bags of fertilizer were carted away. As of the time of filing this report, heavy gunshots rented the air while all shops along the Murtala Mohammed Way, Lokoja, were closed with people scampering to safety. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, William Aya, said the gunshots were from hoodlums who tried to scare people away to enable them to loot. He said the shootings were not from the Police, adding that the hoodlums were being trailed and would be brought to book shortly. Meanwhile, the victims have been taken to State Specialists Hospital, Lokoja, for treatment. The state Commissioner for Information, Kingsley Fanwo, in a statement, reacting to the shooting said, “It is unfortunate that sponsored mercenaries were sneaked into the town to cause mayhem. And it is sad that they shot a journalist who was performing his legitimate duties. “Government will ensure that all the people involved in the violence are brought to book”.
