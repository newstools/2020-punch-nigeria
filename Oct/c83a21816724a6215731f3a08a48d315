John Alechenu, Abuja National Chairman of the Action Democratic Party, Alhaji Yabagi Sani, has asked the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to go beyond rhetoric by taking further steps to address issues raised by the #EndSARS protesters. Sani explained that no nation has ever progressed without peace. Nigeria, he said, could not be an exception hence the need for leaders at all levels to unite in the quest to address the deteriorating security situation across the country. The party chairman said this in a statement titled, ‘ADP calls on PMB to fish out the hooligans in the Army who fired live bullets at peaceful #EndSars youth protesters at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos,  on Tuesday. He said, “The most disturbing is the senseless murder of the peaceful youth protesters by suspected soldiers which provoked and ignited the recent wanton attacks on public and private properties as well as the serial looting of food items meant for distribution as palliatives for the vulnerable in the society but hoard in warehouses by states in some parts of the country, just to mention but a few. “It is on this note that I am appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari, to as a matter of urgency, take a step further and go beyond the clandestine rhetoric of issuing mere presidential broadcasts that leads no one to nowhere in this circumstance. “Elementary knowledge of democracy is a government of the people, for the people and by the people. In this case, the people have spoken, although some of them did so through illegitimate means, but the genuine protesters have made their points clear through their 5- point agenda.” Copyright PUNCH.
