Peter Dada, Akure. The Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, has expressed concern over what he described as the low level of policing in Ondo State, following the apparent absence of the men of the Nigeria Police Force on the streets of the state. Governor Akeredolu advised the police authorities to take up their responsibilities as an institution and take charge of the public space for the good of all. This was contained in a statement issued by the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Donald Ojogo, on Friday evening. The statement read, “The general observation across the state shows a very low level of policing which is risky to society. Of note, policing is key and can only thrive on a note of mutual trust and respect. We can all, only strive for a better society and brace up to take maximum advantage of lessons learnt from the unfortunate incidents of the last two weeks. “Saddening as the events appear, there is no doubt that a fresh orientation, perception of self-appraisal as well as an encouraging mood of sober reflection pervades the nation.” Similarly, the government in the statement issued a seven-day ultimatum to all those in possession of illegal arms and ammunition to return them, saying the ultimatum commenced on Friday, October 30, 2020. According to the statement, Akeredolu specifically directed that all such arms and ammunition should be returned to the Commandant of the South West Security Network, otherwise known as Amotekun at the Pa Fasoranti’s Gardens, Alagbaka, Akure.
