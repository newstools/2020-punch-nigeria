John Alechenu, Abuja THE Director-General of the Progressives Governors’ Forum, Dr Salihu Lukman, has said the All Progressives Congress requires a credible and verifiable membership register in order to lay the foundation for internal democracy. He noted that such a register would provide an avenue for party leaders to work to win votes of members to emerge as candidates. Lukman made these remarks in an interview with newsmen in Abuja on Monday after a public presentation of his new book titled, ‘APC and Progressive Politics in Nigeria’. The PGF is the umbrella body of governors elected on the platform of the APC, Kebbi State Governor, Abubakar Bagudu, is the chairman of the forum. Lukman said, “Credible and verifiable membership register should be the foundation for internal democracy within the party. Secondly, our leaders should work to win the votes of party members in order to emerge as candidates. “Difficult as it is, we need to begin to develop strategies that move our leaders away from the strategy of controlling party structures through imposing leaders in order to emerge as candidates for elections. This is virtually the source of almost all internal conflicts.” The PGF DG also urged party leaders to return to the pre-2015 election era when holding regular meetings to promote party cohesion was the rule rather than the exception.
