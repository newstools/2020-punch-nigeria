Adelani Adepegba, Abuja Senior Staff of Nigerian Polytechnics on Tuesday issued a 21-day ultimatum to embark on an indefinite strike if the Federal Government failed to address lingering issues associated with the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System. This is coming 24 hours after the Senior Staff of Association of Nigeria Universities and Non-Academic Staff Union commenced a 14-day warning strike in protest against the IPPIS and the delay by the government in the re-negotiation of the 2009 SSANU/Federal Government Agreement. Rising from an emergency meeting in Abuja, the polytechnic workers, under the auspices of the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Polytechnics expressed displeasure with the way the National Board for Technical Education had handled the scheme of service. In a communique read to journalists at the end of the meeting, the National President of SSANIP, Philip Ogunsipe, said the workers’ grievances include the non-release of the new minimum wage arrears, inconsistencies in the release of third-party deductions, non-payment of COVID-19 hazard allowance for health workers, high draconian tax regime on consolidated salary, delay in promotion arrears, among others. Ogunsipe said, “Against this backdrop, the council wishes to call on the relevant agencies of government to expedite actions toward resolving these highlighted challenges.
