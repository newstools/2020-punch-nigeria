Samson Folarin The Muslim Lawyers’ Association of Nigeria (MULAN), Lagos State chapter, has condemned the attack on peaceful protesters at the Lekki toll gate. The group, in a statement on Thursday, said it was disturbed by the turn of events in the #EndSARS protests across the country and called for an end to the chaos and anarchy that had followed the demonstrations. The statement said, “MULAN endorses the call for an end to police brutality in all its ramifications and joins all well-meaning persons and institutions in the clarion call for wholesome reforms in the training and welfare of the nation’s police officers and men. “It condemns in unmistaken terms the attack on peaceful protesters at the Lekki toll gate on October 20, 2020 and calls for a full inquiry to unravel the circumstances surrounding the unfortunate incident. “We decry the avoidable loss of lives and properties occasioned by the unfortunate involvement of criminal elements, who capitalised on the protests to wreak untold havoc and chaos in Lagos metropolis in the last couple of days. “We condemn the unwarranted attacks on both private and government properties, especially the High Court of Lagos and the Court of Appeal. As lawyers, we are highly pained by the wanton destruction of judicial facilities and records.” The lawyers asked the government to fish out the perpetrators of the destruction and bring them to justice.
