Samson Folarin The Lagos State Government on Wednesday appealed to market leaders and artisans to make environmental protection a priority as they go about their daily business activities. The appeal was made by the Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, at the flag off of an environmental sanitation advocacy for market leaders and artisans across the three senatorial districts of the state. He stated that the sanitation habits of majority of people in the informal sector would go a long way in defining the cleanliness of the state. Bello said, “We must stop littering our market, and motor parks with waste; we must segregate our waste in our respective market; bag our waste and ensure we patronise PSP operators. Stop creating illegal dumpsites on road medians, kerbs, open spaces, and road setbacks and start policing your environment. “Of serious concern to the ministry and the state is the prevalence of packaging waste such as used plastic bottles, pure water nylon and Styrofoam carelesly disposed, which eventually ends up blocking free flow of water and resulting into flooding.” He urged Lagosians to embrace the waste to wealth initiative of the state where pet bottles and Styrofoam could be sorted in exchange for stipend.
