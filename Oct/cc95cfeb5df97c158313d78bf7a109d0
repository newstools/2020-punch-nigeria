Enyioha Opara, Minna THE Nigeria Union of Teachers, Niger State wing, said it would direct its members to sit at home “if within 21 days, their demand for total overhaul of the entire education system was not carried out by the state government. The ultimatum is contained in a communique issued at the end of the state Wing Executive Council of the union, which took place in Minna, the state capital, on October 19. The 11-point demand of the teachers contained in the communique jointly signed by the state Chairman of the Union, Ibrahim Umar, and Principal Assistant Secretary General, Labaran Garba, includes the immediate “bringing back of teachers in Junior Secondary Schools withdrawn by the State Universal Basic Education Board. The NUT also  expressed concern at the “inadequate and lack of well equipped classrooms in most of our secondary schools in the state particularly in the urban areas, where we have overpopulation of students,” noting that “the situation is hampering effective learning environment”. According to the document, NUT wants the government to “urgently recruit more teachers to fill vacant posts created as a result of retirement, death and transfer of teachers.” Copyright PUNCH.
