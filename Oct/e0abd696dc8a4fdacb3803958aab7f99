Sodiq Oyeleke The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has said that the dissolution of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad is the first step in reforming the Nigeria Police Force. He said this in a video uploaded on his Twitter handle on Monday. He said, “I will like to use this opportunity to say a word on the recent genuine concerns and agitations by Nigerians about the excessive use of force and in some cases extra-judicial killings and wrongful conduct of the men of the Nigerian Police Force. “The disbanding of SARS is only the first step in our commitment to extensive police reforms in order to ensure that the primary duty of the police and other law enforcement agencies remains the protection of lives and livelihood of our people.” The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, had on Sunday dissolved SARS set up to fight violent crimes after protests and a social media campaign backed by music and cinema celebrities. He also announced an investigation into allegations “of crimes committed against citizens”, adding that “the culprits will be punished”. But the protesters insisted that Buhari must address them and issue an executive order on the dissolution of SARS.
