Kayode Oyero Mrs Betty Akeredolu, the wife of the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has debunked reports on social media that she was attacked by some hoodlums today while casting her vote. Mrs Akeredolu described the reports as “absurd” and one orchestrated by “desperate” persons. When asked about the supposed attack, the governor’s wife who spoke with reporters, said, “That is insane, that is absurd and that tells you how desperate people can be in our political landscape. “I am here with you in the ambiance of my country home and somebody is (out) there doctoring videos. I don’t know, was he the one that injured me?” The PUNCH had earlier reported that Akeredolu and his wife voted at Polling Unit 6, Ward 5 at Isokub in the Ijebu Owo area of the state around 09:37 am on Saturday. Akeredolu, who is seeking reelection on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, has estranged deputy governor and Zenith Labour Party candidate, Agboola Ajayi; as well as Peoples Democratic Party’s Eyitayo Jegede as major contenders in the poll.
