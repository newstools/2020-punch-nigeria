The candidate of All Progressives Congress for the senatorial bye-election in Lagos East, Mr. Tokunbo Abiru, on Tuesday, expressed regret over the hijacking of the nationwide #EndSARS protests by hoodlums, which had culminated in the loss of lives and destruction of properties. Abiru, a former Executive Director in First Bank and immediate past CEO of Polaris Bank, however, pleaded with the youths with genuine grievances to take advantage of dialogue and other peaceful means to engage the federal and state governments. He made this suggestion in a statement by his Media Office issued on Tuesday. Abiru noted that due to the violence, the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu was forced to declare a 24-hour curfew to put an end to unnecessary bloodletting and destruction of public assets. Abiru, an economist and chartered accountant who spent 32 years in the private sector, is contesting the senatorial bye-election scheduled to hold on October 31. He had earlier canvassed comprehensive reforms of the Nigeria Police as one of the strategies to stop the defunct SARS from brutalising youths carrying laptops or holding android phones. He had also urged the Federal Government to fully implement the report of the Presidential Panel on the Reforms of SARS, which according to him, would go a long way to change the public perception of the Nigeria Police.
