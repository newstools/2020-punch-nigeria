James Abraham, Jos A former Governor of Plateau State, Fidelis Tapgun, has expressed fears that the seemingly intractable internal crisis in the state chapter of the party could be its undoing in the 2023 general elections. Tapgun, who is a chieftain of the PDP, warned that unless urgent steps were taken to resolve the crisis, it would be difficult for the party to win any election in the state. He said this in an interview with journalists in Jos on Wednesday. He spoke ahead of the Plateau South Senatorial by election slated for October 31. Tapgun said, “As a founding member of the PDP, I am really concerned about the crisis in the state chapter of the party. “In the first place, the election that brought the present party exco led by Chris Hassan was a sham because what took place was not an election, but imposition as more than 20 aspirants boycotted the exercise. This has caused serious division among party members, who are now seeking for justice.” He said the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, tried his best to resolve the crisis but that those who didn’t wish the party well sabotaged his efforts by excluding many aspirants from contesting in the congresses in violation of the peace agreement. The former governor urged the PDP National Working Committee to revisit the issue of party in order to bring lasting peace. Copyright PUNCH.
