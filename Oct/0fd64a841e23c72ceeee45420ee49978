Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri An aide to Emeka Ihedioha, who was sacked as governor of Imo State, has asked Governor Hope Uzodinma to concentrate on issues of governance instead of constantly attacking his principal. The Director-General of Ihedioha’s New Media Centre, Ebube Mbah, who was responding to the governor’s comment on Nigeria’s 60th Independence anniversary that he inherited systematic corruption and payroll fraud from the sacked governor, said that Uzodinma emerged through an unpopular process. “The governor alleged that he inherited ‘payroll fraud’ from Ihedioha. I believe that only Senator Uzodinma and himself alone knows what he meant by that because the memories are fresh in the hearts of Imolites, who witnessed the sincere efforts made by Emeka Ihedioha’s administration to sanitise the civil service in the state. “When Ihedioha came into office, he immediately set up machineries that saw to the successful verification of pensioners and civil servants in the state. This step saw to the regular payment of salaries and pension as of when due. This verification exercise was widely praised as one of its kind among the comity of states in Nigeria and many states made attempts to replicate same. “When Governor Uzodinma resumed office in January 2020 through an unpopular means of what he personally described as ‘Ben Johnson Way’, all the gains recorded in the civil service crashed like a pack of snow. “Today, Imolites are witnesses to what is left of the civil service in the state. I find it amazing how a governor, who is faced with a serious legitimacy tussle, will invest his time in peddling falsehood.” Copyright PUNCH.
