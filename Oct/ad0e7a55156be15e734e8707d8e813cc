Matthew Ochei, Asaba Following the killing of nine Oleh youths in the Isoko South Local Government Area of Delta State, the elite of the Isoko Kingdom have urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and the state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, to intervene in the crisis in order to prevent reprisals and fish out the killers. The nine youths were killed during a clash between the Oleh and Ozoro communities over a land dispute last Friday. In a statement by the Chairman of the Isoko Kingdom Elite Forum, Dr Ogaga Ifowodo, the group called on the federal and state governments to, as a matter of urgency, intervene in the crisis. Ifowodo said, “The dastardly act might not be unconnected to a disputed land with a neighbouring town that shares borders with Oleh. “The drums of war between the two main towns of Oleh and Ozoro are beating; we are calling on Buhari and Okowa to prevent needless bloodletting. A delay can cause reprisals and can lead to the destruction of lives and property as well as social unrest. “For some years now, there has been a dispute over the ownership of land between the two neighbouring communities.

Ifowodo said the culprits must face the full wrath of the law for the complete disregard for human life.
