The organisations also condemned the shootings of protesters at the Lekki toll gate area of Lagos State by soldiers. The leader of Afenifere, Chief Reuben Fasoranti; and President-General of Ohanaeze, Chief John Nwodo, stated this in a joint statement titled, ‘#EndSars: Afenifere and Ohanaeze say no to willful destruction.’ The leaders of Afenifere and Ohanaeze jointly commiserated with all the families who lost their loved ones in the unrest in the country. The statement further stated, “We do not endorse arson as responsible organisations and we call for a stop of the orgies. We have also noted the divisive attempt to use the violence to put a wedge between Yoruba and Igbo and destroy the new understanding we have built in the last three years.

The essence of law and order is for individual citizens to answer for their actions. “It is where law enforcement is weak that you begin to cast ethnic slur when crimes are committed instead of holding the perpetrators. “We appeal to our peoples to continue to live together in peace and harmony and not allow divisive elements to put a wedge between them. Solidarity forever.”
