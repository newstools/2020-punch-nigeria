Matthew Ochei, Asaba The Delta State Government has resolved the row between the Nigeria Medical Association, Delta State chapter; and officers of the Nigeria Army as a result of the manhandling of a medical doctor who was on his way to work by military personnel. Dr Raphael Onyemekehia, a consultant physician at the Central Hospital Warri, was assaulted on Saturday by a team of army personnel at airport junction, Effurun, in the Uvwie Local Government area while on his way to work on the grounds that he was in breach of the curfew imposed by the state government. The assault on the medical doctor by the military officers did not go down well with members of the state NMA, which led to her leadership’s threat to embark on a strike action if nothing was done about the matter. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Mordi Ononye, in a statement in Asaba on Wednesday, however, said, “Following a tripartite meeting comprising officials of the state government, Nigeria Medical Association, Delta state chapter, and the Army, the matter has been put to rest and the earlier threat of strike action by the association shelved. “The truce was achieved after the military representatives expressed regrets over the actions of the erring army officers, apologised to the doctors, and gave an assurance that the unfortunate incident will not repeat itself.”
