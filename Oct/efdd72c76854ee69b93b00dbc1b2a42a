Sodiq Oyeleke Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, has scored his first goal in Serie A as a Napoli player. Osimhen scored his first Napoli goal with a superb finish against Atalanta in the 43rd minute. After scoring, Osimhen held up a shirt with the inscription “End Police Brutality in Nigeria”. Earlier, the player had tweeted in support of #EndSARS protesters in Nigeria. Napoli paid French club Lille a club record fee of up to 80 million euros ($94.6 million) to bring Nigeria forward to southern Italy on a five-year deal. The total fee is almost double Napoli’s previous club record of around 40 million euros paid for Gonzalo Higuain in 2013 and Hirving Lozano last year. Osimhen scored 18 times last season and was one of the revelations of France’s curtailed campaign with 13 Ligue 1 goals as Lille finished fourth. Napoli finished seventh in Serie A and qualified for the Europa League after winning the Italian Cup, their first trophy in six years.
