Kayode Oyero Kwara State Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, has condemned the looting of palliatives stored at the Agro-Mall in Ilorin, the state capital. Hoodlums had broken into the warehouse on Friday amid the ensuing melee which is the aftermath of the #EndSARS protests against police brutality. Different food items were carted away by the unidentified persons in the attack. Reacting via his Twitter handle, the governor said the stolen items were meant to be distributed to displaced flood victims in the state. Abdulrazaq wrote, “We strongly condemn the attack by hoodlums on the cargo terminal and Agro-Mall Ilorin to steal palliatives that we are already distributing to the victims of the recent flood that impacted communities across Kwara. “We had earlier flagged off this distribution in September and we have only 1 Local Government to go out of 16 before the palliatives meant for the vulnerable were carted away by the hoodlums. “We will get to the bottom of this sheer criminality. I thank the security agencies for acting in time & for working on apprehending those responsible.” Similar palliatives warehouses had been looted in Lagos, Jos, Edo, Osun, Akure, and many other major cities. There have been reports of widespread violence, arson and looting in the country as hoodlums took advantage of the #EndSARS protests to wreak havoc and cause mayhem in the country.
