Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The National Information Technology Development Agency has said that it lacks enough resources to fully cover the whole of Nigeria digitally. NITDA’s Director, Corporate Planning and Strategy, Agu Collins, disclosed this during a webinar on South-East Regional Dialogue organised by the PDF Bridge programme and UKAID, with the theme, ‘Improving Market Access Through Digital Trade’. He said, “The resources we have are not elastic enough to cover the whole of Nigeria. Also, we have key demands and we have to maintain what is called federal character and federal spread when we carry out some of our activities. “In NITDA, we carry out intervention programmes. We have actually push it to the grassroots. Not quite long, we had a visitor which was the official delegation from Anambra State IT development agency just like NITDA. Collins added, “We had some interactions with them and they came up with their requirements. We are facilitating the passage of the law that will ensure that every state has an ICT development agency.” He said each state ICT agency would act as a department to interface between the particular state and NITDA, adding that most states were already coming up with their own agencies. “The future of connectivity is very important and we have deployed a lot of computers and equipment to facilitate digital skills that will actually lead to digital economy,” the NITDA official stated.
