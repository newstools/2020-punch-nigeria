Alexander Okere Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Friday said his administration would continue to prioritise education and the welfare of teachers to give pupils a future and place in the global space. Oyetola stated this at the commemoration of the World Teachers’ Day at Odo-Otin, according to a statement by the Commissioner for Information, Egbemode Funke made available to Saturday PUNCH. The governor who was represented by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Prince Abdullah Binuyo, said his administration’s intervention in the education sector so far had been predicated on the recognition that education was the foundation of the state’s development agenda. Oyetola said, “Recognising that education is the foundation of our development agenda, our administration went to work immediately we came into office with the revitalisation of schools across the state to give our children the best education and lay the foundation for sustainable development. “We complemented this initiative with training and re-training of our teachers to make them professional and up-to-date in the discharge of their duties. We shall continue to prioritise the education of our pupils to give them a future, a hope and a place in the global world.” Copyright PUNCH.
