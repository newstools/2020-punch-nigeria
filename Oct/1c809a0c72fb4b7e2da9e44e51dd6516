Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt A Magistrates’ Court sitting in Port Harcourt has remanded a 44-year-old man in police custody for allegedly defiling a six-year-old girl in Umuebele, in the Etche Local Government Area of Rivers State. The magistrate, Amaka Amanze, ordered that the man, Hilary Uzuegbu, be remanded in custody to enable the prosecution to amend his charges. The victim’s mother said the incident happened in June this year but that the police failed to charge the matter to court and asked for out of court settlement. She said the accused had been acting as an uncle to her children and a close family member of her late husband. She said, “My daughter said, ‘Mummy, brother Hilary said that if I tell you he is going to cut off my tongue.’ I said cut off your tongue for what? “The compound people where there. If you were there, you would have shed tears when you see this baby’s body. It was the compound people who gave me money to go to a police station.” Copyright PUNCH.
