Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives is considering the expansion of health insurance coverage under the National Health Insurance Scheme Act 2014, to make health care accessible to more Nigerians. A bill seeking to amend the NHIS Act to this effect passed second reading at the House on Tuesday. In the bill, a copy of which our correspondent obtained on Wednesday, the House is considering the amendment, with a view to extending NHIS coverage to millions of Nigerians living in the rural areas, based on the principles of democracy and social justice as stipulated in Section 14 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). The bill also seeks to define the basic minimum package of the health services to select Nigerians without prejudice to the requirement of payments to the contributory scheme stipulated under the NHIS Act. Sponsor of the bill, Mr Mohammed Bello, said the legislation was to amend the National Health Act to, among other things, “expand its scope to facilitate the provision of free health services to select Nigerians in deserving need and facilitate the realisation of the primary purpose of government.” Copyright PUNCH.
