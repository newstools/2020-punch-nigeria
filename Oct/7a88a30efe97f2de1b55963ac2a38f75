Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Rivers State Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mukan, has called on residents of Ndele and other communities in the Emouha Local Government Area, who fled in the wake of kidnapping and armed robbery along the East-West Road to return home. Mukan made the call while speaking at an event to honour the spokesman for the state police command, Nnamdi Omoni, at the St. John’s Anglican Church, Ndele. The CP expressed happiness that people of Emuoha could now go home and sleep in peace due to the measures employed by the command under his leadership in tackling criminality along the East-West Road. He stated, “Six months ago, most residents of Ndele were either afraid to travel home or needed some kind of security to hold events there due to cult-related killings, kidnap and harassment. “But on assumptions of office, we assembled a special team to surmount the security challenges in Emuoha head-long. Today, events can hold in any part of Emuoha and people go home because cult-related clashes in the area have been tackled.” He said the feat was achieved because of the collaboration between the police and local vigilance group, just as he thanked the church for honouring one of their own. While noting that the command would not rest on its laurels in fighting crimes, Mukan wished Omoni, who was recently decorated as a Superintendent of Police, more elevation.
