Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan The Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Oladunni Oyewumi, has visited the families of slain victims of an #EndSARS protest in the Ogbomoso area of Oyo State. Isiaka Jimoh was shot and killed by the police during the protest by the youths against the brutality of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad. Four more youths were reportedly killed in the town as the protest continued the following day. The Private Secretary to the monarch, Mr Toyin Ajamu, said in an interview with our correspondent on Saturday that the monarch was represented by the Baale Pakiotan of Ogbomosoland, Chief Oyetunji Ojo, who led the delegation on the visit. Ajamu said, “Kabiyesi has visited the bereaved families. He sent a delegation to the families of those whose children were killed. “They visited the bereaved families and offered cash gifts to them. No amount can bring back the dead but the token was to show love and support of Kabiyesi to the grieving families at this trying time.” One of the siblings of the slain Isiaka Jimoh confirmed to our correspondent that monarch sent a delegation to the family on Friday.
