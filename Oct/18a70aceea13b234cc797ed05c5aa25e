Dayo Ojerinde The Category and Brand Manager, PZ Wilmar, Ms. Toyin Popoola-Dania, has warned Nigerians against using unbranded cooking oil. Popoola-Dania, in a statement on Tuesday, said unbranded cooking oil were unsuitable for consumption. She said, “We are living in a time when now more than ever we are more conscious of our health, the COVID-19 pandemic has reiterated the need for healthy eating and the importance of a strong immune system. Therefore, while we are taking all the necessary precautions to avoid contracting and spreading the virus, it is equally important that we pay close attention to what we consume. “Unbranded vegetable oil is unsuitable for consumption and could have negative health implications such as heart diseases due to high cholesterol content and other fattening agents that have been added in them. “Vegetable oil found to be contaminated by the interference with any additive may contain high cholesterol and work against the normal flow of the body, thereby blocking heart vessels and leading to sluggishness of blood movement.” She added that the firm had unveiled a campaign tagged ‘Less is More,’ to sensitise Nigerians to the dangers in the consumption of unbranded cooking oil. “Studies have shown that many people are unaware of these dangers, while many simply consider these unbranded oils more affordable. It was for these and many more reasons we started the “Less is More” campaign to educate Nigerians on the risks of consuming unbranded oil and possibly eliminate unhealthy oil consumption,” Popoola-Dania said.
