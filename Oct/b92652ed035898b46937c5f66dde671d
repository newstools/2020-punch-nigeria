Olufemi Olaniyi, Akure The Ondo State Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, has denied withdrawing from today’s governorship poll. A letter purportedly written by him has been circulating on social media but the Chief Press Secretary to the deputy governor, Babatope Okeowo, when contacted, debunked the claim. He said, “The attention of the Deputy Governor and candidate of Zenith Labour Party, Hon Agboola Ajayi has been drawn to a purported letter withdrawing from today’s governorship race. “Let the general public and the good people of Ondo State know that the Deputy Governor is in the race to win and will not withdraw from the race or merge with any of the governorship candidates.” Ajayi has Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, his estranged principal who is seeking reelection on the platform of the All Progressives Congress; and Eyitayo Jegede of the Peoples Democratic Party; as major contenders in today’s poll.
