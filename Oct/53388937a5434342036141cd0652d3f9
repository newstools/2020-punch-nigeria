John Alechenu, Abuja Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has again urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to address Nigerians and take steps to end the ongoing destruction of lives and property following the #EndSARS nationwide protests. Atiku said this in a video broadcast released by his media office in Abuja on Wednesday. He explained that he had to call all his adult children to ensure they were safe, noting that he also placed the calls to be assured that last night’s events were a nightmare. He said, “But it was real. This is our new normal. As I speak, many parents and homes are in mourning. Their children, mowed down in their prime by a needless show of force by security forces that were supposed to be protecting them. “For over a week, our young people have been trying to draw our attention to their grievances, by way of the #EndSARS movement. “Sadly, it reached a violent crescendo yesterday, with the unprovoked killing of unarmed and peaceful protesters, even while they demonstrated their patriotism by singing the National Anthem. “I call on our armed forces to show restraint. No more lives must be lost. Absolutely none. We must face our common enemies, not our brothers and sisters. And our foes are the terrorists and insurgents, who seek to end the Nigerian way of life. “Finally, I urge President Muhammadu Buhari to speak to the nation, even as he speedily implements the demands laid out by our young compatriots.” He expressed his condolences to families of victims of the shootings just as he urged hospitals to treat the injured and save lives.
