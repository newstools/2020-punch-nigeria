Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo The Council of Senior Staff Association of Polytechnics in Nigeria Zone B on Wednesday gave the Federal Government a 21-day ultimatum to resolve the  challenges affecting the staff of federal polytechnics regarding Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System operations. This was part of the resolution reached at the end of the association’s zonal meeting in Bali, Taraba State. The Zonal Coordinator, Alhaji Sani Ibrahim, and Zonal Secretary Alhaji Adamu Adamu, explained that the council identified inconsistencies in the release of third-party deductions, high tax regime on salary, delay in the release of 2018/2019 promotion arrears, non-payment of minimum wage arrears as part of the challenges in the IPPIS. The council resolved that the Federal Government should expedite action on the reconstitution of  the governing councils for the polytechnics as the tenure of the last governing councils expired since May 2020. The council also called on the FG to connect the Federal Polytechnic Bali, Taraba  to the national grid to save the huge  cost of running the institution on generator. While commending government for reopening schools and putting in place safety measures against COVID-19, the council urged the government to urgently address the breakdown of law and order in parts of the country due to the #EndSARS protests.
