The African Democratic Congress in Ondo State has wielded the big stick against some of its state executives that endorsed candidates of other political parties. National Vice Chairman of the party, Mr Peter Edeh, disclosed this at the party’s grand finale rally held in Akure, adding that “the suspension of our former State executives and chieftains are base on alleged anti-party activities”. Some members of the Peoples Democratic Party, All Progressives Congress, and the Zenith Labour party also announced their defections to ADC. He urged the defectors to deliver votes for the party to liberate the state from suffering and abject poverty. The National Chairman of the party, Chief Ralphs Nwosu, also described the ADC as the fastest-growing party in the country. Nwosu, who was represented by Ibrahim Suleiman, said the party’s candidate for the Ondo election, Dapo Adelegan, is the most credible politician in the state. He said the party is committed to the transformation of Ondo economy. The party’s candidate, Adelegan, urged the party members not to be bothered about defections but to be focused on winning the elections. Adelegan said he had campaigned across the state and confident of victory. (NAN)
