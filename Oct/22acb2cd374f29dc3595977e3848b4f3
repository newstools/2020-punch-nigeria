Peter Dada, Akure The candidate of Zenith Labour Party, Mr. Agboola Ajayi, on Wednesday, expressed confidence that he would emerge victorious in the governorship election coming up on Saturday. He declared that he would defeat the candidates of the other political parties, including the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and the Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, to emerge the next governor of the state. Ajayi, who is also the deputy governor of the state, spoke in Owo, the headquarters of Owo Local Government Area of the state during his final campaign in the town. He said the threat of violence was an empty one as security agencies would be on the ground to protect lives and properties. He advised his supporters not to take arm against anybody but should go out, vote, and make sure their votes count. He said, “We are here to campaign. We are not here to fight anybody. Please, don’t allow anybody to provoke you. Vote and protect your votes.” In his remark, a former governor of the state, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, posited that many people were scared to attend political rallies because of the violence in the past. The former governor said, “Our party believes that government projects are for the benefit of the people. They should know that there is life after office.”
