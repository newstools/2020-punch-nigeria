Tobi Aworinde The Ado Ekiti chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has accused the Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, of arbitrarily renaming the popular Oja-Oba Market to ‘Ado Ekiti Central Market.’ According to a statement, the PDP Chairman in Ado Ekiti, Kayode Yusuf, who spoke with journalists after a stakeholders meeting at the party secretariat in Ajilosun, said, “What Governor Fayemi has done is a mockery of the Omoluabi ethos of an Ekiti son and a well-orchestrated attempt to bring the traditional institution of Ado Ekiti into disrepute. “He arrogantly changed the name of this popular market from Oja-Oba Market to Ado Ekiti Central Market with the sole aim of spiting our revered Kabiyesi. This idea of mocking our heritage or destroying our values at every turn should stop.” Yusuf stated that the Oja Oba Market was at 90 per cent completion by the administration of former Governor Ayo Fayose and that the outstanding funds needed for its completion had already been paid to the contractor. The PDP chairman further noted that the governor should be reminded that power is transient and “the Ewi (the traditional ruler of Ado Ekiti) will continue to run the affairs of the people of Ado Ekiti even after he (Governor Fayemi) leaves office.” Copyright PUNCH.
