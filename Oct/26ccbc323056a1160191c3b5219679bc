TOBI AWORINDE A pharmaceutical manufacturer, May & Baker Nigeria Plc, has underscored the need for more inexpensive medicines for the treatment of malaria. The Managing Director, May & Baker, Mr Nnamdi Okafor, at a media launch of its anti-malaria drug in Lagos, said it was part of the company’s efforts at continually confronting the malarial scourge by providing effective and affordable medicines for treatment of the disease. According to a statement, the drug is a Dihydroarteminsin-Piperaquine combination-based formulation, which ensures fast relief from malaria and guarantees better post-treatment protection. The statement read, “With increasing resistance to older drugs, the World Health Organisation, years back, jettisoned Chloroquine and recommended Artermisinin-based Combination Therapies as a first line drug for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. “However, most ACTs have since then shown limitations, including resistance to treatment. But Dihydroarteminsin-Piperaquine combination, the newer artemisinin-based combination therapy, has shown excellent efficacy in multiple trials and considered the most promising drug currently available for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria.’’ The Executive Director, Pharma Sales and Marketing, May & Baker, Mr. Chukutem Chukuka, said the drug had a reliable efficacy, which guaranteed faster relief, compared to other ACTs available in the market.
