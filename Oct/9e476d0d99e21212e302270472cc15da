Peter Dada, Akure A group of observers who monitored last Saturday’s Ondo State governorship election said the exercise was generally free and peaceful but not entirely fair. A group of election observers under the auspices of the Coalition of Domestic Accredited Observers for Ondo Governorship Election gave the verdict while addressing journalists in Akure, on Wednesday. The incumbent governor and candidate of the All Progressives Congress Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu SAN won the election by scoring the highest lawful votes cast. Speaking with journalists on behalf of the group, in Akure on Wednesday, the spokesperson for the group, Stafford Bisong, said, “Our observers reported that both sensitive and non-sensitive materials arrived early as 7:30am in approximately 95 percent of the polling units across the state making it a great improvement from the Edo state election. Great work in logistics by INEC. “In as much as we give kudos to security personnel deployed across the polling units for the efficient response in curbing violent situations, we however frown at their compromise in working with party agents to perpetrate vote buying. We judge the election to be free and credible.” Copyright PUNCH.
