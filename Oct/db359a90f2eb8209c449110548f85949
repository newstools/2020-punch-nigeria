Oladimeji Ramon Commercial tricycle operators have headed to court to challenge the N8,000 sticker which they are allegedly being compelled to buy by the Kano Road and Traffic Agency. In their suit before Justice Jamilu Suleiman of the High Court of Kano State, they are seeking an order restraining the state agency from “further arresting, harassing, intimidating” them. The suit was filed by one Abdullahi Maisango on behalf of himself and other commercial tricycle riders in the state. Joined as defendants are the Managing Director, Kano Road and Traffic Agency, Baffa Dan-Agundi, and the KRTA itself.

Counsel for the plaintiff, Abba Hikima, took an ex parte application before the court on Friday, seeking an interim injunction restraining the KRTA. After taking argument from the lawyer, Justice Suleiman ordered the parties to maintain the “status quo ante” pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice. The judge then adjourned till October 21, 2020 to hear the motion on notice.
