The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Welbeck Electricity Distribution Limited, Afolabi Aiyela, has told Nigerians to expect improved power supply by next year based on significant foreign and local investments due to the Federal Government’s new Cost Reflective Tariff for electricity. Aiyela, according to a statement, spoke during a visit by a delegation from the Lagos State Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, led by the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mustapha Olorunfemi, to the company’s Ojota power plant. He noted that the sector had become attractive to foreign investors who had become confident about making a return on any investment in the biggest power market in sub-Saharan Africa, in terms of demand. The Wellbeck CEO said, “The expert consensus worldwide is that fossil fuel subsidies have a net negative effect, both in individual countries and on a global scale. Electricity subsidies artificially lower prices, leading to market distortions and consumer wastage.” He said such consequences included environmental, economic and social impacts. Aiyela added, “In Nigeria, in particular, subsidies have led to the increase in energy consumption, strain on government budgets and diversion of funds that could, otherwise, be spent on social priorities (such as healthcare or education) and reduce the profitability of alternative energy sources.” He also praised the Lagos State and federal governments for the support and enabling environment they had created that helped Welbeck to thrive. “One thing is certain; you can’t compare Lagos State to any other state when it comes to independent power. If you look at the independent power producer capacity of Lagos State now, there is no other state to compare.”
