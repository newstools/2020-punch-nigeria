Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Speaker of Ogun State House of Assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, on Wednesday, said no member has received an allowance for constituency projects executed since inauguration 16 months ago. The All Progressives Congress-led 26-member assembly was inaugurated on July 10, 2019. Oluomo, who represents Ifo 1 state constituency, said this while responding to issues raised by an opposition lawmaker from Ado-Odo/Ota II, Musefiu Lamidi, of the Allied Peoples Movement, during plenary on Wednesday. The speaker said, “Most projects embarked upon by the lawmakers in their various constituencies are being financed from their personal resources. “We have spent one year and a few months; no one has collected constituency project allowance because of the economic situation in the country; anything we do is from our sweat. “The assembly will not hesitate to do the needful immediately if we receive any money from the government.” Lamidi had earlier drawn the attention of his colleagues to allegations leveled against him by his constituents. He informed the house that he was accused of collecting the funds and refusing to use it for the benefit of the people. Copyright PUNCH.
