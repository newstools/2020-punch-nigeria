Kayode Oyero The men of the Nigeria Police Force on Sunday attacked protesters calling for the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the police. The #EndSARS protesters, who gathered at the Unity Fountain in Abuja on Sunday, were teargassed by the police operatives. The protesters had said their plan was to make their way to the Force Headquarters to see the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu. Thousands of Nigerian youths have been protesting police harassment and extrajudicial killing by SARS, a specialised unit that was created over a decade ago to tackle armed robbery. Over the years, however, SARS operatives started extorting money from youths driving big cars, using expensive phones, laptops or wearing dreadlocks. The harassment has on several occasions degenerated to killings. The fresh protests which began on Thursday, have been endorsed by both local and international entertainers and several other prominent figures.
