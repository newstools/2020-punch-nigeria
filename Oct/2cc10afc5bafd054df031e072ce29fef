Sodiq Oyeleke The offices of the Federal Road Safety Corps and Vehicle Inspection Unit at the Ojodu area of Lagos State have been set ablaze. Eyewitnesses said many vehicles were burnt. The PUNCH gathered that as of 02.20 pm, the fire was yet to be put out. Also, hoodlums have reportedly set ablaze the terminus of the Bus Rapid Transport at Berger, Lagos State. One of the eyewitnesses, identified simply as Ola, said, “Over 30 vehicles have been burnt. Many cars that were seized are also affected. The entire building is on fire.” Earlier, hoodlums set fire on the new Oyingbo Bus Rapid Transport terminus in Lagos, destroying hundreds of new BRT buses. Thugs, who defied the 24-hour curfew imposed by Lagos State Government, burnt down the terminus, recently opened at Oyingbo in Mainland Local Government Area, about 8.30 a.m. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had on Tuesday imposed a 24-hour curfew following violent attacks on some police stations in Orile-Iganmu and other areas in Lagos. A large number of new BRT buses yet to be deployed to routes but parked in the terminus situated behind railway line in Oyingbo, have all been consumed by the raging fire.
