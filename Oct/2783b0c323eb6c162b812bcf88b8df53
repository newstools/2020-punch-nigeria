John Alechenu, Abuja AN assessment team sent by the All Progressives Congress National Campaign Committee on Ondo State Gubernatorial Election has projected a 55-58 per cent margin of victory in favour of the incumbent Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN. A member of the team, who is also the Director General of the Voice of Nigeria, Mr. Osita Okechukwu, disclosed this at a media briefing in Abuja, on Tuesday. The team also dismissed fears that the alliance of 11 “missionary” political parties would stop the victory of the incumbent governor and APC candidate in Saturday’s gubernatorial election. Okechukwu said, “The APC National Campaign Committee sent some of us to Ondo State for an on-the-spot assessment of our chances. We spent seven days mingling with people of all classes and cadre.” “To be frank, without being immodest, Aketi’s chances of winning the election hover between 55-58 percent.” Take this to the bank and please permit me to name some projects to be executed and the ongoing ones.” Copyright PUNCH.
