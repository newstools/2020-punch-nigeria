Kelvin Ekerete Tunisia duo Ferjani Sassi and Seifeddine Khaoui have tested positive for COVID-19 ahead of Tuesday’s international friendly against the Super Eagles in Austria on Tuesday, The PUNCH reports. The tests were carried out on the Tunisian players after their game against Sudan last Friday, according to a tweet from tunisie-foot.com on Sunday. The news comes as a setback for the Carthage Eagles as they will be without the pair who were in the squad that defeated Sudan 3-0 in Tunis. Olympique Marseille midfielder Khaoui scored the opener for the Tunisians against the Sudanese, before Ali Maaloul and Ben Slimane completed the rout at half time. Zamalek’s Sassi was an unused substitute. The players have since been dropped from the Tunisian squad for the Eagles friendly and have been placed in isolation. Meanwhile, the Eagles players are also expected to undergo COVID-19 tests on Monday (today). They will also be hoping to return to winning ways after losing 1-0 to African champions Algeria on Friday. Copyright PUNCH.
