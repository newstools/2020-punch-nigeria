Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government has inaugurated five digital economy projects with the aim of diversifying the nation’s economy from natural resources economy to knowledge-based economy. Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, inaugurated the projects in Gombe State on behalf of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd). The five projects, according to a statement issued in Abuja on Sunday by the spokesperson of the National Information Technology Development Agency, Hadiza Umar, include NITDA Information Technology Hub in Gombe State University. Others are NITDA Innovation and Incubation Park, Federal University Kashare; Information and Communication Technology Community Centre, Tudun Wada; IT Training Centre, Dukku; and the Nigerian Communications Satellite Regional Office. At the inauguration, Pantami said digital literacy and skills recognised the fact that citizens were the greatest assets in any economy, which was why the government had been inaugurating digital economy projects in various parts of Nigeria. He said the ICT innovation hubs support the development of a large pool of digitally literate and skilled citizens. The minister said the digital economy was a prime catalyst for development, as in less than one year the Federal Government’s efforts in the sector had impacted positively on the economy. According to him, the first quarter and second quarters Gross Domestic Product reports released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that ICT contributed 14.07 and 17.83 per cent respectively to Nigeria’s total GDP.
