Johnny Edward and Kelvin Ekerete Super Eagles players in the French Ligue 1 may miss Nigeria’s 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying double-header against Sierra Leone in November following the recent upsurge in COVID-19 cases in the  European country. Forwards Moses Simon and Samuel Kalu play in the French top-flight with Nantes and Bordeaux respectively. Injured midfielder Wilfred Ndidi and goalkeeper Ikechukwu Ezenwa who have been inactive due to COVID-19, may also miss the AFCON qualifiers. Although Kalu, who injured his hamstring in Nigeria’s 1-0 defeat to African champions Algeria last Friday, may not fully recover before the games on November 13 and 17, new health precautions in France could keep him and Simon away from the clash. The French government on Wednesday announced 22,950 new coronavirus cases, with the government forced to restore a national state of health emergency. The government has placed nine major cities on a 9:00pm to 6:00am curfew, which will apply for at least four weeks. The cities under curfew are Paris and its suburbs as well as Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Saint-Etienne, Rouen, Toulouse, Grenoble, and Montpellier. The curfew will affect around 22million people, and will be applied for four weeks to begin with. The government might extend the duration to six weeks, depending on the situation. Although the clampdown on activities does not include travels and the league, further legislation in France may affect Nigerian players’ availability for the crucial qualifying matches.
