White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced on Monday she has tested positive for COVID-19, three days after President Donald Trump was hospitalized with the disease. “After testing negative consistently, including every day since Thursday, I tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday morning while experiencing no symptoms,” McEnany said in a statement. “No reporters, producers, or members of the press are listed as close contacts by the White House Medical Unit,” added Trump’s spokeswoman, who said she was going into quarantine following the diagnosis.
