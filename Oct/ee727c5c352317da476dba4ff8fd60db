Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Kinsmen of the ousted Osun State chapter chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Soji Adagunodo, on Monday demanded a reversal of his removal from office. The National Working Committee of the PDP recently upheld the decision of the state executive council of the state removing the former chairman from office after finding him guilty of allegations of high-handedness and fraud. However, in a communique issued after a meeting of the Obokun Local Government chapter of the party, where Adagunodo hails from, the local government caucus described Adagunodo’s removal as a “spite on the people of Obokun State Constituency.” The communique, which was signed by the Coordinator and Secretary of the group, Mr Oluyola Adeyemi, and Saheed Adejuwon respectively, said “the step taken on the removal of Adagunodo is unholy and a slap on the faces of the people in the constituency.” Copyright PUNCH.
