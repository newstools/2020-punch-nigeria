Joshua Cheptegei broke the 10,000m track world record on Wednesday in Valencia with a time of 26mins 11.00seconds. He lowered the previous mark of 26min 17.53sec set by Kenenisa Bekele in 2005 in Brussels. This was the 24-year-old 10,000m world champion’s third world record this year. Also, Ethiopia’s Letesenbet Gidey set a new women’s 5,000m world record of 14 minutes 6.62 seconds in Valencia on Wednesday. The 22-year-old lowered the previous mark of 14min 11.15 held by her compatriot Tirunesh Dibaba since 2008 by over four seconds. Gidey put up the run of her short career a year after taking 10,000m silver at the world athletics championships in Doha. With two pacemakers helping her record bid until the 3,000m marker Gidey maintained a ferocious pace to etch her name in athletics’ record books. The performance of the double junior world cross country champion will reignite the debate over the carbon-plated Nike Vaporfly shoes she uses that have revolutionised road running. AFP
