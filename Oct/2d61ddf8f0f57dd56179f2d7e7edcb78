Sodiq Oyeleke The Vice-President of Nigeria, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, has expressed concern over the shootings and killings of Nigerians demanding an end to police brutality and bad governance in the country. He made this known in a series of tweets on Wednesday. The VP, who said he had spoken to some of the victims in the hospital, said those killed or injured as a result of the shootings would get justice. Osinbajo said, “My heart goes out to all the victims of the Lekki shootings, and also the policemen and all other men and women who lost their lives in the past few days in different parts of Lagos and other states. “I spoke to some of those in hospital. The pain of these terrible events is palpable in our towns and cities, and some losses are irreplaceable, but we can and will get justice for all of them. “I stand with Lagos and all other affected states in these trying times. “We pray we will never see a repeat of these tragedies in Jesus name. God bless you all.” Buildings were torched in Lagos on Wednesday following the shooting of peaceful protesters by security forces. Peaceful protesters had gathered despite a curfew imposed to end spiralling protests over police brutality and deep-rooted social grievances at Lekki toll gate before they were shot on Tuesday. At least 12 people were killed by the Nigerian army and police in two locations in Alausa and Lekki toll gate on Tuesday, Amnesty International said. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had announced an indefinite curfew from Tuesday afternoon, claiming that criminals had hijacked the wave of demonstrations that erupted two weeks ago across the country. The Inspector-General of Police also ordered anti-riot units to be deployed around the country. The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), was yet to directly address Tuesday’s incident but in a statement on the protests, the presidency said he had appealed for “understanding and calm across the nation”.
