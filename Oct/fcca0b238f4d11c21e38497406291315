Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo The Nigeria Labour Congress in Taraba State on Wednesday shut down government activities over the non-implementation of N30,000 minimum wage in the state. The labour union had last week issued a seven-day ultimatum to the state government to implement the N30,000 national minimum wage or face strike.

Our correspondent, who monitored the demonstration on Wednesday, observed that government, schools, hospitals, state secretariat and other government offices across the 16 local government areas were shut in compliance with the strike. The State Commissioner for information and Re-orientation, Danjuma Adamu, directed our correspondent to speak with the Head of Service, Suzy Nathan, whom he said, was saddled with the responsibility of negotiating with labour. But when contacted, Nathan warned our correspondent not to jump into her schedule over the NLC strike. “Are you supposed to just call me and ask me about the strike? Do you know my schedule,” Suzy asked as she angrily cut the call. Our correspondent later gathered that the strike was suspended after a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with labour for the implementation of the new minimum wage effective January 2020, while accumulated arrears would be paid in instalment before the end of January 2021.
