Ebenezer Bajela Glasgow Rangers manager, Steven Gerrard, has confirmed that Nigeria international Joe Aribo is close to making a return to action after he returned to training on Thursday evening, but added that the game against Celtic is likely to come a bit too soon for him. The manager stated this during his pre-match conference on Friday ahead of Saturday’s Old Firm clash at Celtic Park. Aribo last featured for the Gers in August following an ankle sprain he sustained in the club’s 3-0 win over St Johnstone at Ibrox. While giving an update on the injury of the club’s players after returning from international duties, the former Liverpool captain revealed that the 24-year-old had resumed training after two months, but will not play a part in today’s game. He said, “The injuries that were with us before; Joe Aribo is really close now and Kemar Roofe is really close. “I think this game might come a bit too soon, but they were back in full training as of yesterday (Thursday) and they will train with the group this morning. I think everyone else is pretty much fine.” Aribo missed Nigeria’s international friendlies against African champions Algeria and Tunisia. Copyright PUNCH.
