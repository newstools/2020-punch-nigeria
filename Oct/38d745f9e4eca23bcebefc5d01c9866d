Bola Bamigbola and Kayode Oyero The governorship election in Ondo State begins peacefully with impressive votersâ€™ turnout in most wards across the state. However, our correspondents observed that there was no social distancing at Sacred Heart Pry School, Ward 2, Polling Unit 10, Akure South Local Government, the polling unit of the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Eyitayo Jegede. Jegede, and his wife, Eno, walked into the premises around 9:00am with a couple of aides and supporters. Although the situation does not suggest the likelihood of violence, there is a massive security presence in cities, towns, and villages. There is also compliance with the restriction on movement across the state. Jegede has Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, who is seeking reelection on the platform of the All Progressives Congress; and deputy governor, Agboola Ajayi, of the Zenith Labour Party, as major contenders in the poll.
