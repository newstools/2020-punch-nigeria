Toni Ufoh Nigerian fans have expressed their disappointment over Bukayo Saka’s decision to play for England ahead of Nigeria. The 19-year-old was included in the Three Lions squad for their friendly with Wales and the Nations League fixtures against Belgium and Denmark. Saka joins the likes of Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori who recently dumped Nigeria for England. He represented England at every age group from U-16 to U-21. “Saka still won’t play at the finals of the World Cup,” Green Ndume tweeted. “No problem. He (Saka) will be used and dumped as usual. These lads should be wise by now. Where is Gabriel Agbonlahor, Jordon Ibe, Nedum Onuoha, Charlton “Cole? Saka and Tomori will walk into Eagles but can’t get into the Three Lions. Good riddance,” Victory Amikeo tweeted. “He won’t earn more than five caps before he will be dumped just like what England did to Agbonlahor, The Eagles is our pride, when you have the likes of Ahmed Musa you have hope. I strongly believe one day we would achieve a lot,” Abdul Waheed Abdurahman added. “Honestly football-wise, having to choose between Nigeria and England isn’t a choice really. with Nigeria, he had a chance of winning something but with England, he won’t win anything,” Zandile wrote. Chimezie Igwe also tweeted, “They will rush and use them and then later dump them. Good luck Saka.” Copyright PUNCH.
