John Charles, Makurdi The Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has said the #Endsars protest across the country has drawn the attention of leaders to the inadequacies in governance. The governor said this during the inauguration of a Steering Committee to organise a summit to chart the roadmap to address issues affecting young people in the state, in Makurdi, on Wednesday. He explained that young people constitute a larger percentage of the Benue population and by implication, they deserve not only to be carried along, but also play active roles in government. The governor said, “The #EndSARS protests across the country had drawn the attention of leaders at all levels to inadequacies in governance and the need to correct them for a better and guaranteed future for the youths. “You must dedicate yourselves to working to ensure that Benue youths take their rightful position in the social, political and economic spheres of life. I assure you that our government will give you every support and cooperation that you need to succeed in this very important assignment.” Copyright PUNCH.
