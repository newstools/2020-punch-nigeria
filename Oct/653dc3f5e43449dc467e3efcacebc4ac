Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State House of Assembly has converted the impeachment of former Speaker, Frank Okiye, to resignation. A motion to that effect was moved by the Majority Leader of the House, Henry Okhuarobo, and seconded by the member representing Esan North East Constituency II, Emmanuel Okoduwa, who had been appointed the Chief Whip of the House. Okiye joined the lawmakers during the plenary session. Okhuarobo said the need to reverse the speakerâ€™s impeachment followed appeals from their constituents. Consequently, the motion, which received the overwhelming support of the members, was adopted by the House. The new Speaker, Marcus Onobun, told journalists shortly after the plenary session that there was no rift between the House and the executive arm of government, while the former speaker said he was pleased that the House reversed its decision on him.
