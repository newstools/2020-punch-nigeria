Ada Wodu, Calabar The police in Cross River State have launched a manhunt for those who killed a robbery suspect on Thursday at the Ikot Ansa bus stop along the Murtala Muhammed Highway, Calabar. The state Commissioner of Police, Abdulkadir Jimoh, disclosed this to our correspondent after the suspected robber was lynched by a mob, adding that a manhunt had been launched to arrest the culprits. The CP stated in a text message, “Unfortunate and sad. (I am) calling a stakeholders’ meeting after the #EndSARS debacle. Meanwhile, the police have launched serious investigation and manhunt for the perpetrators.” It was gathered that there had been several cases of breaking into shops in the Ikot Ansa area, where the mob action took place on Thursday. Jimoh had warned against incessant lynching of suspected robbers and kidnappers across the state after three suspected kidnappers were beheaded and burnt recently. Thursday’s incident occurred barely two days after two suspected robbers were burnt to death by a mob along Parliamentary Extension, Calabar. Copyright PUNCH.
