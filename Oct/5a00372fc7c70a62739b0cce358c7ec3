Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The lawmaker, representing Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwajowa Federal Constituency of Oyo State in the Federal House of Representatives, Mr Shina Peller, has urged youths to shun drugs and other vices that may have negative effects on their mental health. Peller, while addressing 60 youths drawn from the 30 Local Government Areas of Osun State at a leadership training organised by the Lead Generation Initiative, said drug addiction could prevent the youths from fulfilling their leadership potential. He said, “Your state of mental health is directly proportional to your capacity to deliver as leaders. Many youths indulge in drugs and other vices which is not allowing them to fulfil their potential. The purpose of this training is all-encompassing. Our youths must not engage in drugs and other things that will limit their capacity to lead. “Nigerian youths are valuable assets to the nation. To best put it, they are critical stakeholders in the nation-building process. However, they need to strive to take their rightful place and stop being constantly short-changed.” Copyright PUNCH.
