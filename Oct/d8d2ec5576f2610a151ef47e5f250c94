Kelvin Ekerete Former Flying Eagles coach, Godwin Uwua, says he is ready to return to football but will not beg to get a coaching job. Uwua’s last coaching stint was with Lobi Stars, with the experienced gaffer resigning his position in 2017 after a fall-out with the club management, which led to him being suspended for three matches. The former Niger Tornadoes manager said he was enjoying his break from the sport but would consider a return with the right offer. “If I’m called upon to share my wealth of experience, why not? But I will not beg anyone because I want to return to coaching,” Uwua told The PUNCH. “I’ve coached almost all the national teams in this country, I have coached almost all the big teams in this country and successfully too. I have a UEFA B license that can enable me to coach anywhere in the world.” Uwua said he rejected two coaching opportunities as he felt it wasn’t the right time to return to the dugout. “I’m very okay. One or two clubs came for my services but at that time I was not ready, that was why I continued to stay on my own and I’m fine,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
