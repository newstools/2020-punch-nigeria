Maiharaji Altine, Gusau Bandits have killed 22 people in Tungar Kwana village in the Talata-mafara Local Government Area of Zamfara State. An indigene of the village, Mallam Ahmed Mohammed, told our correspondent that the bandits, numbering over 100, invaded the village around 11pm on Tuesday night and opened fire on everyone in sight. He said, “Twenty-two people, including children and women, were killed instantly, while other people escaped into the forest.” Mohammed said many people were also wounded as a result of gunshots and were taken to the hospital for treatment. “They also took away several cows, sheep and goats as well as foodstuffs,” Mohammed added. He said the village had been deserted for fear that the bandits might return. Confirming the incident, the spokesperson for the police command, SP Mohammed Shehu, said, “The police have confirmed the killing of 20 people in that village; not 22. “The villagers give the security agents useful information about some bandits who rustled cows last week and the information had assisted greatly in locating and killing many of them. Since that time, the bandits were targeting the villagers in order to avenge the killing of their people.” He said that the police command had drafted its personnel in order to arrest the bandits and bring them to justice.
