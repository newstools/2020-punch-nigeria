Peter Dada, Akure TWENTY-four hours after the results of the Ondo State governorship election were declared, the main opposition parties, the Peoples Democratic Party and the Zenith Labour Party, have yet to announce their next line of action. The Independent National Electoral Commission on Sunday declared Governor Rotimi Akeredolu as the winner of the election, having won the majority of the total votes cast in the poll. In a chat with the state Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr Kennedy Peretei, the party said the election matter had been committed to the legal team of the party to decide whether it would be taken to the Election Petition Tribunal or not. Peretei simply said, “Our legal team is still studying the results.” In the same vein, the ZLP and its candidate, Ajayi, has not made any statement on their next line of action on the election. All efforts to reach the party’s candidate were unsuccessful as his line indicated switched off. Meanwhile, the state APC Publicity Secretary, Mr Alex Kalejaiye, said, “Akeredolu’s determination, not desperation, reflected in his work plans and mode of operations.” Copyright PUNCH.
