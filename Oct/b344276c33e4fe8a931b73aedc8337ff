Sunday Aborisade, Abuja the senator representing Kogi West Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Smart Adeyemi, has said the United States visa ban on Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, was based on misinformation about the 2019 general election as well as Kogi State governorship election. Adeyemi, a former national president of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, said this while speaking with Senate correspondents on Saturday. He said that arguments of those who claimed that the elections were fraught with irregularities and violence could not be proven sufficiently at the courts by those who challenged the victory of the All Progressives Congress and its candidates in the elections. Adeyemi said, “I will say these things are not true of your person; they are not true of our state. Many people don’t know the complexity of this state. Kogi State is one of the largest states in Nigeria and I can tell you that we are the most diverse people. “For you to govern a state like Kogi, then you can govern Nigeria. To hold people together is one of the greatest traits of leadership. “Some people said we were not going to win the election but their analysis did not tally with the complexity, the diversity and certain things that were happening in our state.” Copyright PUNCH.
