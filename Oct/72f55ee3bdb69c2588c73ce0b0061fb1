Dayo Ojerinde The Executive Secretary of the Lagos State Blood Transfusion Service, Dr. Bodunrin Oshikomaiya, has tasked the agency’s stakeholders and partners to initiate innovative and inclusive strategies to improve and increase voluntary blood donation among residents of the state. Oshikomaiya, at the LSBTS stakeholders’ quarterly partnership engagement forum, said finding an all-inclusive and innovative way to encourage voluntary blood donation was crucial in the drive towards meeting the   blood demand of the state. She explained that stakeholders could explore various strategies for improving and increasing voluntary blood donation including involving public hospitals in the recruitment of voluntary blood donors; establishment of blood donor centres in easily accessible locations and the establishment of mobile donor sessions. “This forum affords us the opportunity to gather views and concerns on challenges confronting us in our drive to increase voluntary blood donation whilst also giving room for practical recommendations from key stakeholders on how to surmount the challenges,” Oshikomaiya said. She added that the quarterly partnership engagement forum provides an opportunity for LSBTS and stakeholders to review strategies and discuss issues of common interest regarding the availability of safe blood in the state.
