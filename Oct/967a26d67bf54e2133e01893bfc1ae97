Victor Moses has left Chelsea to play at Spartak Moscow for the 2020/21 season, the Blues confirmed on Thursday. Moses, 29, has barely featured at Stamford Bridge over the past few seasons, spending most of his time elsewhere on temporary moves. That will be his fate once more this term, as he penned a loan deal with the Russian club which will run until the end of the season and includes a purchase option. “Victor Moses has joined Spartak Moscow on loan for the remainder of the 2020/21 campaign,” Chelsea revealed in a statement published on the club’s official website. “The Russian side are 10 games into their league season and sit second in the table, level on points with city rivals CSKA Moscow. “Spartak also confirmed the move, writing on the club’s Twitter page, “Victor Moses is a Spartak player! “Spartak Moscow and Chelsea have agreed the transfer of Nigerian star Victor Moses to our club. The loan agreement with the 29-year-old midfielder is until the end of the season with the option to buy! Welcome, Victor!” Moses made the move to Stamford Bridge from Wigan in 2012, having begun his career at local side Crystal Palace as a youth. He enjoyed his most consistent run in the first team under the stewardship of Antonio Conte from 2016-18, starting regularly in both of the Italian’s seasons at Stamford Bridge and lifting the Premier League title in 2016-17.
