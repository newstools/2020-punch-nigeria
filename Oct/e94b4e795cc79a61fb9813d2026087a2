The IGP, while condoling the family and friends of Stanley equally commended the officers of the Delta State Police Command for exercising restraint “in the face of the immoral and unjustified provocation.” The statement titled, ‘#EndSARS protesters go berserk, murder one policeman, injure another in Delta State’, added, “The IGP has directed the Commissioner of Police, Delta State, to carry out a discrete investigation into the unfortunate incident, root out the perpetrators and bring the killer protesters to book.”
