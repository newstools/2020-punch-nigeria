Tony Okafor, Awka The Anambra State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Police Brutality, Extra-Judicial Killing, and other Related Matters inaugurated by the state governor, Willie Obiano, is yet to sit. The panel has three weeks to round off its proceedings and submit its findings to the state government. Obiano had inaugurated a 32-man judicial panel of inquiry to look into the allegations against the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad unit of the police following the #ENDSARS protests in the state some weeks back. But checks by The PUNCH showed that the panel had not commenced sitting. It rather on Tuesday called for submission of petitions, complaints, and memoranda from the public. An announcement in that respect by the panel’s secretary, Mrs Rita Onyeka, gave two weeks as the deadline for submission of such documents. It stated, “Please take notice that all petitions, complaints, or memoranda should be submitted to the panel not later than two weeks from the date of this publication.”
