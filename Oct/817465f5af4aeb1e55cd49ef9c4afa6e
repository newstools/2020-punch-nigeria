Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Coalition Against COVID-19 has explained that the scale of the nationwide food distribution programme and the number of persons to benefit from the palliatives are some of the reasons that delayed the delivery of the items. In a statement by its spokesperson in Abuja, Nwanosiobi Osita, the coalition stated that it had been working with  the minister of the Federal Capital Territory and the Nigerian Governors’ Forum to procure, deliver and distribute the food relief items. It said the distribution was to almost two million most vulnerable families (over 10 million Nigerians) across the 774 local government areas of Nigeria as part of its support in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The coalition said, “The sheer scale of this nationwide food programme and the timing of the orders and deliveries, which coincided with the lockdowns and reduced movement across the country, compelled CACOVID to roll out distribution in a staggered manner.”  Copyright PUNCH.
