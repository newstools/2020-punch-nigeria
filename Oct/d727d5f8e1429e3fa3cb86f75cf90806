Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Publicity Secretary of the Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, Chris Nehikhare, has expressed confidence that the re-election of Governor Godwin Obaseki will end years of neglect and oppression of the people of the state. He said this at a function organised in Evboehighae, the headquarters of Ugbeka in Orhionmwon Local Government Area, on Friday. Nehikhare also commended the PDP leadership for appreciating the people for voting for the party. He expressed gratitude to the people for the support given to the PDP despite the area being the hometown of the APC governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. Nehikhare said, “We kept the margin to return Governor Godwin Obaseki during the governorship election, even though they tried to entice our people with money to buy their votes. Our people came out defiant and voted for PDP because of the achievements of Governor Godwin Obaseki.” Earlier, Mr. John Unu, the PDP Ugbeka, Ward 3 Chairman, congratulated the Governor on behalf of the party and people of Ugbeka.
