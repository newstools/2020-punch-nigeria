Sodiq Oyeleke Former Vice President of Nigeria, Abubakar Atiku, has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to address protesting youths in the country. He cautioned the president against the use of force on the #EndSARS protesters. The Peoples Democratic Party candidate in the last presidential election made this known in a series of tweets on Tuesday. He made the posts a few hours after the Inspector-General of Police, Adamu Mohammed, deployed anti-riot policemen nationwide. He tweeted, “I am saddened by the loss of lives following the infiltration of hoodlums in the #EndSARS peaceful protests. “My appeal to the government of President Buhari is that he must not succumb to the temptation to use further maximum force on #EndSARS protesters. “The #EndSARS protesters are not unreasonable; they mean well and acted responsibly. “This is the time to appeal to their reason by speedily implementing their reasonable demands. “The use of maximum force will aggravate, rather than placate. “When the government shows that it cares, the citizens will fare well. Now is the time to apply reason, rather than brute force. “And on that basis, I urge President Buhari to talk to the nation, and particularly the youth of Nigeria.”
