Kayode Oyero The Peoples Democratic Party candidate in today’s Ondo State governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede, has explained that his refusal to jump the queue at his polling unit was to serve as an example for the good people of the state. Jegede and his wife, Eno, arrived at Ward 2, Polling Unit 09, Akure South Local Government, around 09:00am. The former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in the state got to the premises with a couple of aides and supporters. Speaking with The PUNCH, Jegede said, “Don’t forget that I am a citizen of this state. The same blood that flows in my veins flows in their veins. It is only fair that we stay where we should be. “The truth is that so many people came here so early and it will be unfair for me to jump the queue. We must lay good examples, we must lay good narratives.” Jegede has Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, who is seeking reelection on the platform of the All Progressives Congress; and deputy governor, Agboola Ajayi, of the Zenith Labour Party, as major contenders in the poll. The PDP candidate, who lost to the incumbent in 2016, said God asked him to challenge Akeredolu again.
