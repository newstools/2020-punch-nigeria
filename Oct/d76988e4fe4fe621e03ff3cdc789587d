Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Development Agenda for Western Nigeria has cautioned the Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity to the President, Garba Shehu, against insensitive utterances in reaction to calls for the restructuring of the country. The Director-General, DAWN Commission, Seye Oyeleye, who described Shehu’s comments as unfortunate and unwelcoming, said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), should carefully consider why the people are making the call rather than discountenance it. Oyeleye said, “What Garba Shehu said is very unfortunate because government is enlisted to serve and listen to the people. If the people are clamouring for a particular thing, it is the duty of government to listen and ask why and is what they are clamouring for right or wrong? What they should do is that they should have listening ears. “The whole country is saying that we need to restructure for us to survive as a country. Why is the clamour for restructuring becoming louder? What is this government doing that is necessitating the clamour? That is what this government should sit down and do. They should not see it as being indicated or threatened.

For Shehu Garba to come out to say that government cannot be intimidated is a very unfortunate statement. A government in democracy should be listening. This is not a military government.”
