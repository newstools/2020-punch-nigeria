Hindi Livinus, Yola Governor Ahmadu Fintiri has imposed a 24-hour curfew on Adamawa State. This is after the vandalisation of the government property by hoodlums who broke into warehouses to cart away COVID-19 palliatives. Fintiri, in his statewide broadcast, said the government took the action as a precaution, following the activities of “some misguided elements” who have broken into warehouses looting COVID-19 palliatives. Earlier on Sunday, The PUNCH reported the looting of a government-owned warehouse at Kwana-waya by angry residents, who later broke into the Central stores located at Barkin Kogi and looted food items. The governor said, “Reports of people dying in the stampede have been received and we cannot afford to allow anyone to lose his or her life. “We must also avoid a scenario where the security agents will be blamed if any person loses his/her life while being prevented from looting and destroying Government property. “In view of the above, I have declared and imposed an indefinite dawn-to-dusk curfew throughout the state, beginning from 3 O’clock, Sunday 25 October, 2020.
Movement by all manner of vehicles, except as authorised is hereby prohibited as the curfew comes into effect.” The governor also attributed the delay in the distribution of the palliatives, which hoodlums and several other angry individuals targeted and looted on the unavailability of rice to complement other consumables.
