Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Police Service Commission has said it would not allow “outlaw policemen” to tarnish the image of the Nigeria Police Force. The agency, which has the mandate to discipline and promote men of the force, pledged to address the excesses and rights violations by the personnel of both the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squads and other special units attached to the office of the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu. This is coming against the backdrop of the IGP’s directive to senior police officers to compile cases of abuse of power and indiscipline by the rank and file and forward same to the Force Headquarters by Friday. The PSC in a statement on Wednesday by its spokesman, Ikechukwu Ani, acknowledged the measures announced by the IGP to stem the nefarious activities of the personnel and promised to henceforth, sanction any errant officer. It, however, blamed the absence of supervision by relevant supervisory authorities for the rot in the force.

This mandate, it will discharge without fear or favour.”
