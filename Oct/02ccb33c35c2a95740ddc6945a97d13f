Ifeoluwa Oyerinde A Lagos State polytechnic student, Shalewa Adebowale, has gone missing while on her way home from her cousin’s house in the Igando area of the state. PUNCH Metro learnt that the 19-year-old nursing student left her parents’ house at Olorulogbo, Anthony village, Lagos, on October 10, 2020, to sit an exam. She reportedly decided to spend the night at a cousin’s house after the exam ended late. Our correspondent gathered that Shalewa later left the cousin’s house to board a bus at Checkpoint bus stop, LASU Road, en route to Iyana Ipaja. Her whereabouts since then had been unknown. Shalewa’s sister, Feyikemi, told PUNCH Metro that their father heard last from her around 7.09pm on October 11. “She told him that she was dying and that she needed help. We reported the case at the Anthony and Ikeja police stations. The officers at both stations did not take the case seriously and they are slow with the investigation,” she added. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, asked the family of the victim to meet the Personal Assistant to the Commissioner of Police and also advised them to go to the State Intelligence Bureau.
