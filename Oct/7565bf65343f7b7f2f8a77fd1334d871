Bola Bamigbola At least three persons died in Osogbo on Saturday as the #EndSARS protest turned violent. Also, many vehicles in the convoy of Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, were damaged following an attack by suspected hoodlums at the scene of the protest. The PUNCH gathered that one person, whose name could not be immediately ascertained, died at Ladoke Akintola Teaching Hospital, Osogbo. A doctor in the hospital, who preferred anonymity, told The PUNCH that the deceased died of gunshot injuries. A security operative also confirmed that two others died at the Old Garage end of Osogbo. “Three persons are in the mortuary after the attack. Our DJ and two others were shot dead,” a member of #RevolutionNow Movement, OlaOluwa Owoeye, said. Shortly after the governor arrived at the scene, the Osun State Coordinator of the #RevolutionNow Movement, Olawale Bakare, had demanded an apology from him for refusing to engage the protesters after nine days of protest. Bakare also demanded immediate arrest and prosecution of a leader of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, identified as Asiri Eniba. Eniba was accused of sending thugs to attack the protesters. While responding to the demands, Oyetola, after an apology to the protesters for failing to address them since the protest started, promised to make enquiry from the Commissioner of Police to ascertain the involvement of the NURTW boss in the alleged attack. He also denied sending thugs to attack the protesters and promised to pay the hospital bills of all those injured during the protest.
