Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State Government has said the newly passed Ogun State Waste Management Law 2020 has made it an offence for producers to trade in discarded or used materials. The government said the action was taken to save people from contamination and other health hazards. According to a statement by the Press Officer in the Ministry of Environment, Rotimi Oduniyi, the Special Adviser to Governor Dapo Abiodun on Environment and Waste Management, Mr Ola Oresanya, disclosed this while addressing a virtual meeting of the Ogun State chapter of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria. Oresanya said, “The new law has now put an end to poor handling of industrial waste, which has been identified as a major source of hazardous waste contamination in the state as well as unregulated waste trading among industries. “Industries and producers must now provide information on characteristics of industrial waste, ensure proper storage of waste within their premises, comply with the principle of duty of care on the environment prior to collection of discarded materials by designated collectors and maintain regular interaction with the Ogun State Waste Management Authority’s client service managers on a first responder transaction level.” Copyright PUNCH.
