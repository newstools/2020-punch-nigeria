He added, “And you know that this Appropriation Bill will be passed before the first of January.” “So, they have to focus on the Appropriation Bill at this time. I think that is going to delay deliberations on the PIB till the first quarter of next year.” Sylva expressed the belief that the bill would be passed in the first quarter of next year because there was consensus around the passage of the PIB.
