According to him, the appropriate court to try electoral matter was the Magistrate Court or High Court of the state. The same argument was canvassed by the counsel to the other defendants. However, the prosecuting counsel, Francis Jirbo, countered the argument with the submission that the information before the court is a money laundering charge for which the Federal High Court has exclusive jurisdiction. After listening to both counsel, Justice M. G. Umar adjourned the case till January 20, 2021 for a ruling. Ize-Iyamu and other defendants were first arraigned before Justice P. I. Ajoku on eight counts of money laundering on May 24, 2018.
