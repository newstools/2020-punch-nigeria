Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Power generation on the national grid has again hit another all-time peak of 5,520.4 megawatts, surpassing the recent peak of 5,459MW. Figures released by the Transmission Company of Nigeria on Saturday showed that the latest peak generation of 5,520.4MW was recorded on October 30, 2020 at 9.15 pm. The previous peak of 5,459MW was recorded on October 28, 2020, as data from the government-owned transmission firm showed that the new peak surpassed the previous one by 60.9MW. Commenting on the development, TCN’s General Manager, Public Affairs, Ndidi Mbah, said the new national peak was a result of collaboration among players and the gradual increase in capacity in the power sector. She stated that with the current capacity of 8,100MW, TCN seamlessly transmitted the new peak at a frequency of 50.11Hz through the nation’s grid. “As players in the power sector value chain continue to work together to improve the nation’s power supply, TCN implores everyone to help protect power infrastructure nationwide,” Mbah said. The transmission company urged Nigerians to desist from bush burning or burning of trash beside transmission towers or under power line cables nationwide. This came as the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company explained the reason for the load-shedding experienced by its customers in many of its franchise locations within and around Abuja. It said the load-shedding was occasioned by the fault on one of the 60MVA transformers at the TCN 2 x 60MVA station at Kubwa, Abuja. The Disco, however, said it was working with TCN on how to speedily resolve the issue especially because of the onset of the dry season. It appealed to all affected customers to bear with the company, adding that it was working assiduously with TCN to ensure the restoration of normal supply to the affected power users.
