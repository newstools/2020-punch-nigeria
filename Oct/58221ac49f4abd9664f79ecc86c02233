Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe Nigerians have come to the rescue of a nursing mother, Blessing Bassey, and her baby, who for seven months had been sleeping on the floor of one of the wards of Mojol Hospital, Church Street, in the Shasha area of Lagos State. PUNCH Metro had reported that the 27-year-old was delivered of a baby girl at the hospital through a caesarean section. The hospital management, however, ordered nurses and doctors to ensure that Blessing did not leave with her baby until the N95,000 balance of their bill was paid. The Cross River State indigene, who bemoaned her fate, said efforts by her husband to raise the money were abortive. After the PUNCH’s publication on October 2, 2020, various persons and groups offered to settle the bill. Among them were Right and Welfare of Traumatised Wives and Youths Initiative, Global Medical Organisation, and others who wanted to remain anonymous. Blessing, while appreciating PUNCH for the report, said, “If not for the publication, there will be no hope for me and I will still be sleeping on the hospital floor.” Copyright PUNCH.
