Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo THE opposition Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress in Osun State on Tuesday engaged in a war of words over the governance of the state. The state Chairman of the PDP, Mr. Sunday Bisi, accused the APC of treating the state as “a mere political shopping mall, where they trade and elope to their bases.” Bisi said this while addressing party members shortly after he was sworn in at the state party secretariat in Osogbo. He said, “They (APC) are too disconnected and preoccupied with serving the ruinous interest of their god of mammon rather than serving the state and saving it from economic deprivation. “They cannot help it because Osun, to them, is purely a political shopping mall, where they trade and elope to their base. In response, the state APC spokesperson, Kunle Oyatomi, said, “The current acting chairman of the failed party, PDP, in Osun should stop hallucinating as the good people of Osun are very happy with the government of Governor Gboyega Oyetola. “The task of the opposition PDP is not clear yet, and cannot be clear, as many of their members are angry with the leadership. In fact, the PDP in Osun is in serious crisis which cannot even be managed since they lack managerial skills.” Copyright PUNCH.
