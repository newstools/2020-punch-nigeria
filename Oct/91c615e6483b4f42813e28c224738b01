Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The insurance industry has the capacity to contribute more to the overall growth of Nigeriaâ€™s Gross Domestic Product, the Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers has said. NCRIB said this to members of the House of Representatives Committee on Insurance and Actuarial Matters during a one-day retreat for National Assembly members in Abuja. The President, NCRIB, Bola Onigbogi, said on Tuesday that it was the first time that the council would be taking such an action to bridge the gap in communication between registered brokers and members of the National Assembly. Onigbogi stated that the industry in Nigeria was challenged by many factors, stressing that the lack of sufficient legislative support in form of enabling laws that could enhance the growth of the industry was a major concern. She, however, noted that since the inauguration of the current National Assembly, the council had started seeing improved collaboration. On the Insurance Consolidated Bill before the National Assembly, the NCRIB president expressed optimism that the retreat would help the House of Representatives Committee to have more knowledge about the bill.
