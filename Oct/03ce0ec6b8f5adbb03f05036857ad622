Tunde Oyekola Two persons are feared dead after hoodlums invaded the office of the Nigeria Customs Service, Ilorin, Kwara State. The hoodlums reportedly tried stealing lorryloads of rice bags impounded from suspected smugglers when armed officers fired gunshots to resist them. It was gathered that while one of the miscreants allegedly died during the attack, a Customs officer was also allegedly killed. The state Public Relations Officer of the NCS, Chado Zakari, confirmed the attack to our correspondent but didn’t confirm the casualties. “We will issue a statement soon,” he said. Meanwhile, hoodlums, on Friday, attacked the Shoprite Mall along Fate Road, Ilorin and engaged in massive looting of the shops inside the mall. The hoodlums were seen rushing into the expansive mall, carting away various items on their heads, motorcycles and even vehicles to their various homes. There was no security officer to halt the hoodlums’ action as of press time. Meanwhile, the state government has declared a 24-hour curfew in the state, following the development. Copyright PUNCH.
