The Peoples Democratic Party Governors’ Forum has expressed its support for the party’s candidate in the Saturday Ondo State governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede. The Forum Chairman and Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal made the declaration in a statement issued by the Director-General of the forum, C.I.D. Maduabum in Abuja on Sunday. According to the governors, the “time” of Jegede, who lost to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress in 2016, “has come”. Tambuwal, while refuting reports that there was division in the party, stressed that the PDP governors were united to ensure the election of Jegede. He said, “We think that the story is the handwork of fifth columnists, who are afraid of the popularity of the PDP candidate and his likely victory, and have devised this means of creating doubts in the minds of Nigerians as a strategy for stopping the march of victory by PDP in Ondo. “Nothing can stop the march of progress in Ondo. Indeed, Jegede’s victory is one whose time has come. “The Forum speaks with one voice and this naked attempt to sow division and discord within its ranks has failed miserably.” READ ALSO: Outrage grows over SARS menace, Osinbajo, others condemn killings, arrests, extortion He said that the PDP governors were fully aware of the importance of the Ondo election to the image, solidarity and fortunes of the PDP as a political party. “The governors are in no doubt that any division in its ranks will be counterproductive to PDP, her candidate and its quest to restore democracy, good governance, and accountability not only in Ondo State but Nigeria at large. “The PDP governors will storm Akure on Oct. 7 for the grand finale of the PDP governorship campaign. “We will be in Akure to conclude a memorable grassroots-based campaign mounted by the PDP and her candidate in the last few weeks that has seemingly turned the tide in Ondo,” he added.
