Popular comedian, Debo Adebayo, known as Mr Macaroni, who also joined the protesters, lamented the actions of FSAR operatives. He appealed to the government to intervene, adding that many Nigerians are unsafe in their homes. He said, “Being here is not because we don’t have a home. It is because we are scared that even when at home, bullets can find their ways into our heads. So, we want the government to step in and step in now.” After listening to the demands of the protesters, part of which included the total disbandment of the anti-robbery squad, Speaker Mudashiru Obasa appealed to them to return home. He assured them that there would be an emergency meeting Friday morning with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and other concerned authorities.
