Deji Lambo Some Nigerians have faulted the claim by a woman that her son, identified simply as Anthony, was killed when soldiers opened fire at #EndSARS protesters at the Lekki tollgate area of Lagos State. PUNCH Metro had reported that the yet-to-be-identified woman claimed in a video that Anthony’s corpse was recovered by his friends. The clip, however, generated reactions as Nigerians took to their social media pages to refute the woman’s claim that Anthony was killed by the soldiers. Many said Anthony, though a protester, died in an accident. A lady, identified simply as Pretty Loveth, wrote on Facebook, “He didn’t die at Lekki tollgate, him (he) and his two friends bumped into a trailer on their way home at Petrocam Filling Station, close to Lagos Business School, Ajah. RIP Tony, we all miss you brother.” In another reaction, a Twitter user, Ijaw Philosopher, also refuted the woman’s claim, saying, “Tony Umeh was among the three people that had an accident on their way back from the protest before the toll gate incident, so why is this London woman alleged to be his mother claiming he was killed by the military?” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, said the command was not aware of the death. “We have no such record. I am not aware of the case. Maybe when the incident happened, they didn’t inform the police,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
