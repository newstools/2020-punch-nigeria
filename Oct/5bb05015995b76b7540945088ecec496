Oladimeji Ramon The President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Mr Olumide Akpata, on Sunday paid a visit to the Lagos State High Court in Igbosere to see the level of damage done to the court after it was set on fire by hoodlums last Wednesday. The National Publicity Secretary of the NBA, Rapulu Nduka, said Akpata and his team were joined by the Chief Judge of Lagos State, Justice Kazeem Alogba, in their tour of the burnt court. According to a statement, the NBA team also went to the City Hall, which was equally set ablaze by hoodlums, to see the level of damage done to the office of the NBA Lagos branch, housed in the facility. “While at the City Hall building, the NBA President met with victims of the Wednesday attack, particularly the proprietors of five law firms housed in the City Hall, whose offices were looted and vandalised by the hoodlums. “The NBA president commiserated with the victims of the attack and assured them of the association’s cooperation in ameliorating their losses. “The NBA urges the Federal Government and the various state governments to take lawful proactive steps in containing the current volatile situation in the country,” the statement read in part.
