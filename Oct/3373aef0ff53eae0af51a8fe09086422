The paper has now been fixed for Monday, November 16, 2020, between 10am and 1pm. A statement issued on Sunday by the Head, Information and Public Relations Division, NECO, Azeez Sani, titled: ‘Rescheduling of Paper I Computer Studies Practical in the ongoing 2020 SSCE’, said the decision was caused by the #EndSARS protests that blocked the free movement at the city entrance gate in Benin.
