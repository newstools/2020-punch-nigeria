TONY OKAFOR The police in Anambra State have killed a suspected armed robber in a gun battle. The suspect was said to be among a robbery syndicate that had allegedly terrorised the people on Isiagu Ring Road in the Awka South Local Government Area of the state. It was gathered that the gang was robbing occupants of a black saloon car of their valuables at gunpoint when the police stormed the scene. Confirming the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Haruna Mohammed, said the incident happened around 9pm on Friday. He said, “About 9pm on Friday, there was a distress call that suspected armed robbers blocked Isiagu Ring Road in Awka South Local Government Area, robbing three occupants of a black Acura Legend car with Lagos registration number SMK878GL of their valuables at gunpoint. “Following the distress call, police operatives attached to the command Special Anti-Robbery Squad Central Police Station, Awka and local vigilantes quickly responded and rushed to the scene. “As soon as the suspected armed robbers sighted the police, they engaged them in a fierce gun battle, forcing the hoodlums to jettison the robbery operation and scampered into the bush for safety. However, during the gun duel, one of the gang members whose identity is yet unknown was fatally wounded, and one fabricated gun, three cartridges, one torch, three handsets and some cash allegedly snatched from the victims were recovered.’’ He added that efforts were being intensified to apprehend other fleeing suspects believed to have sustained gunshot wounds during the encounter.
