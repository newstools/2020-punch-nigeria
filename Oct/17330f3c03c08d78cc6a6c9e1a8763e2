Oladimeji Ramon Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project on Thursday approached the Federal High Court in Lagos for an injunction backing and protecting the #EndSARS protesters. In a fresh lawsuit, which has the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.); the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu; Commissioner of Police, Lagos, Hakeem Odumosu; and the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami; as defendants, SERAP prays for an order protecting the protesters from harassment. The protesters had come under attacks both by policemen and suspected state-sponsored thugs. SERAP is urging the court to issue an injunction restraining Buhari and the other respondents sending their agents to “harass, arrest, detain or in any other manner infringing on the fundamental rights of peaceful protesters in the EndSARS/SARSMustEnd / ReformPolice protests or any other peaceful protest in Nigeria.” READ ALSO: #EndSARS group receives over N77m in one week The group asked the court to declare that Buhari has no legal right “using members of the Nigeria Police Force through the 1st and 2nd respondents, the military and other paramilitary formations to intimidate, threaten, ‘arrest’, beat, harass, shoot, kill and detain unarmed peaceful protesters in the ‘EndSARS/‘SARSMustEnd’/‘ReformPolice’ .” It asked the court to declare such clamp down on protesters as a violation of sections 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40 and 41 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 and Articles 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 of the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights [Ratification & Enforcement] Act Cap.
