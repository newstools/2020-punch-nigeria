John Alechenu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has said it is still expecting congratulatory messages from opposition political parties, especially the Peoples Democratic Party, on its victory in last Saturday Ondo State governorship election. The Chairman, Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Governor Mai Mala Buni, said this in a chat with journalists at the APC National Secretariat, Abuja, on Monday. Buni said, “It is said, one good turn deserves another, and just like we congratulated the PDP in the Edo election, we look forward to seeing PDP and the other political parties extend similar gesture to us in the spirit of good sportsmanship. “By so doing, we will make elections in Nigeria healthier and attractive, rather than making elections a do-or-die affair.” But responding, the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, described Buni’s expectation as ludicrous. Ologbondiyan said, “It is indeed ludicrous and completely absurd that Governor Buni is begging for endorsement of the election in spite of his awareness that the internal mechanism that produced his party’s candidate, as presided over by him, was faulty. “Instead of begging the PDP for congratulatory message, Governor Buni should rather speak to this disturbing stealing of oil money to fund his party’s vote-buying at the expense of Nigerians who are bearing the brunt of increase in the pump price of fuel and corruption in the oil sector under the APC.” Copyright PUNCH.
