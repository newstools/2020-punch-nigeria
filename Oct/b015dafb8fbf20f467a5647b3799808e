Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The people of Orun Ekiti in the Ise/Orun Local Government Area of Ekiti State have said the case of exhumation of 10 corpses for ritual by three individuals pending before an Ado Ekiti Chief Magistrate’s Court did not happen in the community. The President, Orun Ekiti Progressives Union, Elder Samuel Ogunjemilua, and the National Secretary, Adebayo Akinyemi, spoke in reaction to a story which said the incident happened at Orun Ekiti. Akinyemi said, “There are two separate Orun Ekiti towns in Ekiti State. The other Orun Ekiti is in the Irepodun/Ifelodun Local Government Area, where the incident happened. But it was reported as Orun Ekiti in Ise/Orun.” Copyright PUNCH.
