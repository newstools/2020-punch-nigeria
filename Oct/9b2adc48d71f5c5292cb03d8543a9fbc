Chima Azubuike The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, on Friday, paraded gang members, who were in possession of illicit substances, around the Yalenguruza area of Gombe State. Confirming the arrest, the acting commander of the NDLEA in the state, Mrs Rosana Nnodim, said the 120 compressed cannabis weighed 99kg, adding that the command required assistance to unravel more. Nnodim said, “We made a good arrest over the weekend. You will recall that about two weeks ago, we intercepted about 22kg of tramadol on two outings. We made an arrest of 120 compressed packets of cannabis sativa, which were in blocks. The 120 blocks weighed 99kg and the two suspects are with us.” Calling for synergy from members of the public in reporting cases, she noted that the arrest of the suspects had averted “impending disregard” for civil order. He added, “if that quantity had gone into circulation without checks, you know what that means. We will continue to do our best and we ask anyone concerned to partner the NDLEA. We can’t achieve much without information. We urge society to support us with information. If a child is into drug dealing, the parents and siblings are in danger.” Copyright PUNCH.
