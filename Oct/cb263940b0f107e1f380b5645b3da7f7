Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan The Oyo State Government has announced approval for the reconstruction of the 45.3 kilometre Saki-Ogbooro-Igboho road at the cost of N8,700,456,862.72k. The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Taiwo Adisa,  said this  in a statement on Wednesday. The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Muyiwa Ojekunle, while  briefing newsmen on the outcome of the 28th Oyo State Executive Council meeting explained that the project was awarded under the Alternative Project Funding Approach which would see the contractor initially execute the project with its funds, while the state would pay back through scheduled repayments. The Executive Council also approved the installation of 58 motorised boreholes across the 33 local government areas in the state at the cost of N312,202,900. Similarly, the Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Dr. Wasiu Olatunbosun, hinted that the State Executive Council approved semi-autonomy for four secondary hospitals as the pilot scheme for quality health care delivery in the state.
