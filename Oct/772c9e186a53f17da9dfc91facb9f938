Ebenezer Bajela Cyriel Dessers, Chidera Ejuke, Kevin Akpoguma and goalkeeper Matthew Yakubu are all set to make their debut for the Super Eagles in Friday’s (today) international friendly against Algeria, The PUNCH reports. The trio is part of the six new players called up for the games against the Desert Foxes and Tunisia in Austria. Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr invited six new players: Samson Tijani, Ejuke, Zaidu Sanusi, Frank Onyeka, Dessers and Yakubu, to the squad, but German-born Akpoguma joined the team after he was cleared by FIFA to represent Nigeria. Eagles media officer, Toyin Ibitoye, told The PUNCH that the 25-year-old Akpoguma would be available for selection. “There is a possibility now that Akpoguma will feature for the Eagles and there won’t be any problem because his clearance has come from FIFA,” Ibitoye told The PUNCH. The Hoffenheim defender stated that the depth of talents in the Eagles influenced his decision to snub Germany for Nigeria. “I decided (to play) for Nigeria because I see a lot of potential in the team, in the country,” Akpoguma told the Super Eagles media team in an Instagram conversation. “We have top players like Sammy (Chukwueze), Victor (Osimhen), Wilfred Ndidi, (Alex) Iwobi – they are top players, they are playing in top leagues. “If you put all of them together you’ll have a great team, for me, it is a big honour to play with these guys.” Copyright PUNCH.
