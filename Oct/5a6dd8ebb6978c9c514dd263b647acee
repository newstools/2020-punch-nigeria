Samson Folarin The Lagos State Polytechnic has said a 19-year-old girl, Shalewa Adebowale, is not one of its students. The Director of Information and Public Relations, LASPOTECH, Olanrewaju Kuye, stated this in a statement on Monday. Shalewa left her parents’ house on Olorunlogbon Street, Anthony Village, Lagos, on October 10, 2020, to sit an exam. She reportedly decided to spend the night at a cousin’s house after the exam ended late. The following day, the teenager was said to have left the cousin’s place to board a bus at Checkpoint bus stop to Iyana Ipaja. Her whereabouts have been unknown since then. Her sister, Feyikemi, told PUNCH Metro that their father heard last from Shalewa around 7.09pm on October 11, adding that she claimed to be ‘dying.’ However, LASPOTECH said in a statement that the victim was not its student. “The missing young lady is not a student of the Lagos State Polytechnic as your headline reads. According to your report, she is a nursing student and the polytechnic does not offer the course. Besides, the polytechnic does not have a campus at Ojo,” Kuye said. Copyright PUNCH.
