Peter Dada, Akure A member of the Ondo State House of Assembly, Mrs Favour Tomomewo, has declared that she is still a bonafide member of the ruling All Progressives Congress, insisting that she was never expelled from the party at any time. Tomomewo, who represents the Ilaje Constituency 2 in the Assembly, was declared expelled by the ward executive of the party for allegedly involving in anti-party activities during the last Saturdayâ€™s governorship election in the state. The letter of expulsion of the lawmaker was signed by the Chairman and the Secretary of Mahin Ward 4 Ilaje Constituency 2, Mr Olagoke Ajimuda and Mr Omosule Taid respectively. However, Tomowewo in a statement on Thursday, said she had not received any letter from her ward executive, expelling her, describing the purported expulsion as a rumour. Copyright PUNCH.
