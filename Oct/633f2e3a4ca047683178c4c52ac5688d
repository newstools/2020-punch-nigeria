Oladimeji Ramon A Lagos-based lawyer, Chief Malcolm Omirhobo, has commenced a legal action against the Corporate Affairs Commission over the provision of the 2020 Companies and Allied Matters Act, which empowers the commission to suspend the board of trustees of an organisation and set up an interim management committee for such organisation. In the suit before the Federal High Court in Abuja, Omirhobo is praying the court to strike down “the entire Section 839 of the CAMA 2020, which gives CAC the powers   to suspend or remove trustees of associations and appoint an Interim manager or managers to manage their affairs.” The lawyer is contending that Section 839 of CAMA 2020 is in conflict with the provisions of sections 36, 38 , 40 and 45(1)(a)(b) of the 1999 Constitution. He is praying the court to make an order “invalidating, voiding  and/or expunging Section 839(1)(a)(b)(c)(2)(3) (5)(a)(b)(7)(a)(10)(a)(b)(11)  and /or the entire provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act of 2020 for want of form, legislation, legal framework and/or regime and for not being reasonably justifiable in a democratic society. “If any other law is inconsistent with the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution, the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution prevail and that other law null and void to the extent of that inconsistency,” Omirhobo argued.
