Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin An aide to the Edo-born Business mogul and the Chairman, Ocean Marine Limited, Capt Hosa Okunbo, on Monday denied speculations that his principal had taken ill and flown abroad after the Edo September 19th governorship election. The aide who did not wish to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media said, “The election has been fought and won, why are they desperate to rubbish the image of Capt Hosa and even wish him dead if they don’t have a hidden vicious agenda of vendetta against him? “In a rare show of statesmanship Capt. Hosa congratulated the winner of the election, something I am sure they would not have done if the pendulum had swung the other way around.” He added that the allegations that Hosa took contracts from Edo State Government which he never executed as another lies “The records are there for anyone to check if Capt Hosa participated in any so-called contract sleaze. In any case, Governor Godwin Obaseki, has been in office for almost four years now, why has he not come out with any evidence and proof that Capt Hosa is a defaulting contractor to Edo state?” Copyright PUNCH.
