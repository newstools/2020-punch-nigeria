James Abraham, Jos A warehouse where COVID-19 palliatives were stored in the Bukuru community of Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State was on Saturday looted by hoodlums. It was learnt that the hoodlums gained entrance into the warehouse said to belong to the State Emergency Management Agency after breaking into the premises around 9am. After breaking into the warehouse, the hoodlums asked the residents to pick whatever they could see in the warehouse and return home, eyewitnesses said. A resident, Haruna Jugul, who witnessed the looting said the security operatives initially tried to disperse the hoodlums when they mobilised to the warehouse but could not do much as the hoodlums resisted them. Jugul said, “This morning around 9am, we saw some hoodlums gathered at the warehouse. The Warehouse served as the distribution point for COVID-19 palliative during the recent lockdown in the state. “Before we knew what was happening, the hoodlums broke into the place and started looting the palliatives stored in there. “When the security operatives could not stop them, other residents joined in the looting and carted away all the relief materials.” It was learnt that the hoodlums also moved to another location at the JIB premises and looted the palliative stored in the place.
