Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt Residents of Industry and Harbour Road in Port Harcourt City Local Government Area of Rivers State are still in shock over an explosion that rocked the state-owned ailing ‘Flour Mill Company Limited’. The explosion which occurred on Friday was said to have affected nearby buildings causing panic among residents. Though the cause of the explosion at the flour mill which has been non-functional for over a year could not be ascertained, eyewitnesses described the sound resulting from it as ‘very loud’, saying it immediately resulted in a huge fire. One of the eyewitnesses told our correspondent that though the factory was not operational, some persons were offloading some unspecified products when he left the facility about the time the incident took place. “I left the flour mills about ten minutes when I heard the explosion. I don’t know what caused it because we came back to the place but could not get in because it was dangerous,” he said. The Flour Mills facility is surrounded by the Nigerian Ports Authority, Ports and Terminal Operators Limited, the Nigeria Customs Service and other business concerns.
