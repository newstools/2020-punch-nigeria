Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has urged the people of the state to be peaceful and orderly as they go to the polls on Saturday to elect a governor for the next four years. This is contained in a statement signed by the Director-General of his campaign council, Mr Victor Olabimtan, on Friday in Akure, the state capital. Akeredolu appealed to the people to conduct themselves in a responsible manner to prove all who had predicted violence-marred polls wrong. Akeredolu said he had done his best for the people and had left the rest to God and the people of the state to decide. The statement read, “Good people of Ondo State, I thank you for your support thus far. Campaign activities officially came to an end yesterday. We thank you for conducting yourself peacefully and honourably. As you go to the poll tomorrow to choose your new Governor, I urge you to be peaceful and honourable like you have always been. “Please, do not provoke anyone, and do not be provoked. Be orderly, say no to violence. Say no to vote-buying. Ensure you are responsible as you perform your civic responsibilities tomorrow. And most importantly, remember the sons and daughters of whom you are. “Remember, a good name is better than gold and riches. As for us, we have done our best, and leave the rest to God. We sincerely believe the God we serve with one mind will see us through.” (NAN)
