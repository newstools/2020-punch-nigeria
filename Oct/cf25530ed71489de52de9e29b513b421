Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The idea behind the construction of the rail line from Kano to Maradin in Niger Republic was purely economic rather than political, the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, said on Friday. Amaechi said people should stop politicising the project as it would create more employment opportunities and enhance imports and exports that would open up Nigeria through neighbouring countries. Speaking in Abuja, he said, “The decision to invest in Kano-Maradin rail line is purely economical; no politics. People are the ones politicising it. “I made that decision because there is a competition between the coastal states of Nigeria, Benin Republic, Togo and Ghana.” He added, “The other three countries are able to move cargoes from this landlocked countries to their seaports for either export or import. “They are able to do those businesses but we are not able to do them because the landlocked countries are complaining of crimes. The road are not safe in Nigeria; there is custom interference, police checkpoints here and there.” According to Amaechi, to be able to attract those cargoes, the government decided to construct a rail line from Kano to Maradin, a village in Niger Republic. He said there was also a plan to build warehouses there to be able to attract cargoes from neighbouring countries and transport them effectively to Tin-Can or Apapa seaport for onward movement or for export. “Or we can make them import through our seaports and we drop it off at Maradin where they can use their cargoes,” the minister said.
