Adelani Adepegba, Abuja SEVERAL terrorists have been reportedly neutralised and their hideouts and logistics structures destroyed by the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole at Tumbuma Baba, one of the Island settlements on the fringes of the Lake Chad in Borno State. The island settlement serves as a logistics hub for the Islamic State of West Africa Province elements. This was achieved in airstrikes executed on Tuesday under the ongoing subsidiary Operation Hail Storm 2 after intelligence reports indicated that several ISWAP fighters and some of their leaders had converged on some structures concealed under the thick vegetation of the area, preparing to launch an attack. The Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj. Gen. John Enenche, in a statement on Wednesday, said the ATF dispatched fighter jets and gunships, which eliminated several insurgents. The statement titled, ‘Operation Hail Storm 2: Scores of terrorists killed by air task force of Operation Lafiya Dole in Lake Chad,’  read in part, “The ATF dispatched a force package of Nigerian Air Force fighter jets and helicopter gunships to engage the location. The attack aircraft scored devastating hits on the settlement, killing several terrorists and destroying their structures.” Copyright PUNCH.
