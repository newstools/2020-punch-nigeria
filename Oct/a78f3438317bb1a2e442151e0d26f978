James Abraham, Jos At least thirty people escaped being killed after a storey building collapsed at the Yanshanu suburb of Jos, Plateau state. The building housing eight households, it was gathered, collapsed after a heavy downpour on Friday. A resident, Adamu Mubiro, told our correspondent in Jos on Saturday that the occupants were lucky as the building came down minutes after they were evacuated. Mubiro said, “When the rain started, we heard some sound from the building with four flats and some people came to warn the occupants to vacate the place. “Less than ten minutes after they moved out of the building, it collapsed around 9am.” The General Manager of the Jos Metropolitan Development Board, Kefas Yirlwang, who also confirmed the building collapse, however, said that no life was lost. Yirlwang said, “It was an old building that collapsed during heavy rain.  Immediately, we heard of the incident, our men were immediately deployed in the area and fortunately, there was no loss of life as the occupants were safely taken away. ” The General Manager warned residents to steer clear of dilapidated structures to avoid any untoward incident, especially during the rains.
