John Alechenu, Abuja tHE Governor of Ekiti State and Chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum, Kayode Fayemi, has dispelled speculations that the All Progressives Congress has reneged on its promise to restructure Nigeria. He noted that as a demonstration of its commitment to the issue, the party set up the El-Rufai committee to make recommendations to its leadership. Fayemi said this in an interview with journalists in Lagos on Sunday as part of activities to herald the celebration of his second year of his second term in office. According to him, the panel has since submitted its report and “concrete steps had been made to make proposals to the National Assembly.” He also said the Senator Ovie Omo-Agege -led Senate Committee on the Review of the Constitution would soon commence its activities and was sure to capture relevant recommendation for legislative action. Fayemi said, “True federalism is the answer,” to most of the challenges Nigeria was grappling with at the moment. He noted that the onus was on the National Assembly to look at the previous reports of national conferences. He said many recommendations along the line of restructuring, devolution and true federalism were embedded in the reports of the Niki Tobi Panel, the 2004 Conference set up by former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the 2014 conference established by former President Goodluck Jonathan.
