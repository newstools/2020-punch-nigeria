Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin Activists under the aegis of Coalition of Civil Society on Autonomy of Local Governments in Nigeria, have threatened to take legal action against the Kwara State governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, if he fails to set in motion the machinery to conduct local council elections by November 2020. Convener of the group, Mallam Musa Aliu, issued the threat at a press conference, in Ilorin, on Wednesday. He noted that though the governor had in May 2019, illegally suspended the democratically elected members in the 16 local government councils in the state. Aliu said, â€œWhere the government refuses to reinstate the members of the illegally dissolved members of KWASIEC or constitutes a new one and inaugurate them on or before the 15th day of November, 2020, this illegality will be challenged in court.
