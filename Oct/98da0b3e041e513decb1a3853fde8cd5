Johnny Edward Midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, will miss Leicester City’s Europa League group games, The PUNCH reports. The group stage draw of the competition was held in Nyon, Switzerland last Friday, with Leicester City, pooled alongside Zorya Luhansk, AEK Athens and Braga. The Foxes begin their Europa League campaign at home to Zorya Luhansk on October 22. But Ndidi, who underwent a successful groin surgery a fortnight ago, is not expected to return to action until Christmas, according to Brendan Rodgers. This means he will also miss Nigeria’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying double-header against Sierra Leone in November. “The good news is that his surgery has been successful,” Rodgers told a post-match conference. “We want to get Wilf back. “He’ll be a little bit of time out but his operation has gone well. He’s return after Christmas will make us even stronger when he is back.” Their first away trip is to AEK Athens a week later, with a home tie against Braga following on November 5. Copyright PUNCH.
