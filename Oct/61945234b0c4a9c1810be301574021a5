John Alechenu, Abuja Elected National Executive Committee (Non-National Working Committee) members of the All Progressives Congress have again urged the national leadership of the party to revisit the party’s reward system to encourage hard work and loyalty among members. Members of the body also passed a vote of confidence in the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/ Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee. This was contained in a position paper titled, “Governor Buni-Led APC Caretaker Committee Has Returned Party to Winning Ways – NEC Members… Pass Vote of Confidence” jointly signed by Abubakar Sadiq Saadu (Chairman) and David Okumba (Secretary) and addressed to the APC Caretaker Committee Chairman, Mai Mala Buni, in Abuja, on Thursday. The paper was made public after a meeting they held with the Buni-led leadership of the party at the APC National Secretariat, in Abuja. According to the paper, the decision to pass a vote of confidence which was coming barely 24 hours after the state chairmen of the party did the same on Wednesday, was in recognition of the work being done by the caretaker committee in pursuit of its mandate of repositioning the party. The Non-NWC NEC members urged the APC Caretaker Committee to give priority attention to the party’s reward system, internal democracy, membership drive, administrative structure, and general welfare. It read in part, “Our concerns and recommendations are borne out of our collective desire for a more viable and prosperous APC. We wish to reaffirm our confidence in your ability to contribute meaningfully in salvaging our beloved party and return it to the fast lane of electoral victories.” Copyright PUNCH.
