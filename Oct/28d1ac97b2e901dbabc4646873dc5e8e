Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The pan-northern socio-political organisation, the Arewa Consultative Forum, said Nigeria’s greatest undoing was her poor and visionless leadership that had over the years failed to harness the country’s abundant natural and human resources for the development. The ACF stated this in a message to mark the country’s 60th Independence Anniversary on Thursday. According to a statement titled, ‘ACF salutes Nigeria at 60’, the country has since independence been mired in short-sighted leadership and mindboggling corruption that have shocked her citizens and the world. In the statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe, the ACF noted that Nigeria should have achieved greater heights, but for its visionless leaders. The statement read in part, “The Arewa Consultative Forum felicitates with President, Muhammadu Buhari, and the Nigerian people on the 60th anniversary of Nigeria as an independent nation. “Our greatest undoing is poor, visionless leadership which has failed to take advantage of these God-given gifts to build a virile, progressive nation. “The country has since independence been mired in short-sighted leadership, mindboggling corruption that has shocked her citizens and the world. Nigerian leaders have consistently remained mediocre, refusing to build even on the modest achievements of the First Republic leaders.” Copyright PUNCH.
