Chima Azubuike, Gombe Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya, has asked the Federal Government to assist in rehabilitating the state airport. The governor who spoke on Tuesday lauded the Senate committee on Nigerian Airforce for supporting the establishment and speedy take-off of the Combat Reconnaissance Group in Gombe. He spoke when members of the Senate Committee on Airforce paid him a courtesy call at the Government House. Yahaya told his visitors that Gombe was the only state that shared boundaries with all five states in the North-East. This, he said, made it easy for the state to become a hub of victims of insecurity in the sub-region thereby overstretching its human and material resources. He also briefed the committee on the condition of the Gombe international Airport which he said required the National Assembly’s intervention for upgrade to ensure smooth operational activities. He said, “The Gombe International Airport came into being through synergy between Gombe state government and the Federal Government on a 50-50 basis. “Since the aviation agency charges a huge amount of money for maintenance and other sundry services, today the state owes close to a billion naira. “Gombe State Government requests the intervention of the Federal Government in clearing this backlog.” He noted that the airport services were needed by the Nigerian Airforce as well as other security agencies, hence the need to partner in upgrading the airport.
