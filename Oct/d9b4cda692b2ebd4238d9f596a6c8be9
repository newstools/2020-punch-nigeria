  Seventeen political parties, including the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party, are fielding candidates in todayâ€™s governorship election in Ondo State. However, there are only three main contestants and analysts have predicted the poll will largely be a three-horse race. The three parties are the ruling APC, PDP, and the Zenith Labour Party, with Akeredolu, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, and Deputy Governor Agboola Ajayi as the respective candidates.
