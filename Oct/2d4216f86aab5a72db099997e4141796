Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa THE Pan Niger Delta Forum has declared that Nigerians are not happy under the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and currently going through “anger and anguish”. The PANDEF National Chairman, Air Commodore Idongesit Nkanga (retd.), made the assertion during a virtual world press conference, which was streamed via Zoom from Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, on Thursday, to mark the country’s 60th independence anniversary. Nkanga said, “PANDEF feels the anger and anguish in the land, and the various protestations are expected. People are not happy with the way things are going in the country, with worsening insecurity, unemployment and harsh economic strains on populace. “We are in the middle of a mist; no one can predict what comes next. We can either work together in unity and respect or sink as a country.” He noted that the level of injustice being perpetrated against some sections of the country, the Niger Delta region, in particular, was unprecedented. Nkanga further stated, “President Muhammadu Buhari needs to demonstrate and reassure Nigerians of the government’s sincere commitment to the wellbeing of all Nigerians; North, South, East or West; irrespective of religion and ethnicity.” Copyright PUNCH.
