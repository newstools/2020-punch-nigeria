Joseph Olaoluwa #EndSARS protesters demonstrating against police brutality and extrajudicial killings in the country on Monday took to the Lagos airport to ground activities to a standstill. As early as 9am, several blockades were mounted at different locations from the local airport down to the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, forcing several passengers to opt for alternative means of transportation. Singing solidarity songs with placards, the protesters marched towards the entrance of the MMIA where they expressed their grievances. A worker with the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria who pleaded anonymity said the protesters did not break into the airport. The source said, “They came but they didn’t block anybody. They just came to register their presence at the end of the day and the airforce officer escorted them to the tollgate.

The source added, “The problem with the terminal is that all the access points have been blocked. Passengers are finding it hard to get to the terminal. Cars are not picking passengers at the terminal. “Passengers are trekking to the terminal but operations are still ongoing. I am supposed to drive home but I also have to trek.” A passenger, Okonofua Akhankoa, said, “They came around twice and they just spoke to us. They aired their views. We had to come early to avoid the protests. My flight is by 10pm. I have been here since 7am.” Our correspondent observed tight security around the local and international wings of the Lagos airport.
