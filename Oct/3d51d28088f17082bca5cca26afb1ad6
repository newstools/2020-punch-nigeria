’Femi Asu Niger Delta Power Holding Company has said it is ready to install infrastructure to increase power supply to industrial clusters in Lagos and Ogun states. The Managing Director, NDPHC, Mr Chiedu Ugbo, said the management of the company had recently met with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State and his Ogun counterpart, Mr Dapo Abiodun, to seek their support and cooperation. Ugbo, who spoke during an inspection visit to Olorunsogo Power Generation Company in Ogun on Wednesday, said the NDPHC had signed an agreement with Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company for reliable power supply to industrial clusters in areas under its network. According to him, the Olorunsogo Power Plant has a capacity of 750MW, but has a limited off-take from the Transmission Company of Nigeria which leads to energy losses. He said, “We came here with IBEDC that is in charge of most of the Southwest states to discuss with them in terms of distribution to end users. “Our distribution essentially is how we can work together under bilateral agreement that will see us supply the electricity to them and they will distribute to eligible customers. This will include industrial clusters and even residential clusters.” According to him, the assets of NDPHC were established by monies belonging to Nigerians by the government and should therefore be utilised for the benefit of the people.
