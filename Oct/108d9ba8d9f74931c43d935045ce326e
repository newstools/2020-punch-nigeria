A former deputy governorship candidate under the umbrella of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ekiti State, Mr Deji Ogunsakin, has denied any involvement in the violence that erupted in the state during the #EndSARS protest by youths in the state. He said in contrast to what his detractors would have people believe, he was in complete support of the peaceful protest against police brutality and the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad among other pertinent demands by the protesters. He accused the All Progressives Congress in the state of linking him and former Governor Ayo Fayose to one of the reported masterminds of the violence. In a statement on Saturday, he said, “My attention has been drawn to a misleading and malicious news report alleging my involvement in the violence that erupted in Ekiti State during the protest by Ekiti youths demanding an end to police brutality. “For the record, let me state unequivocally that I am completely in support of the peaceful protests. In my base in Lagos State, I have joined the #EndSARS protest a few times and I have pictures to back this up. “I have no hidden agenda, no enemy to fight and absolutely no need to sponsor thugs to aid a protest that I have openly participated in here in Lagos. I urge the people to fully cooperate with the police as they investigate this matter. “I have equally informed my lawyers to immediately file charges against the peddlers of the fake news.”
