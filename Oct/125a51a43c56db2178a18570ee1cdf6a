Nike Popoola Only 9,103,653 workers had Retirement Savings Accounts with Pension Fund Administrators as of the end of August. The National Pension Commission  disclosed this in its ‘Total RSA registrations as at 31 August 2020’ latest report obtained from on Friday. PenCom also said in its second quarter report, “The RSA registrations grew to 9,039,727 as at second quarter 2020, moving from 8,998,580 in the first quarter 2020, representing a growth of 0.46 per cent.” The growth was attributed to the increased level of compliance by the private sector as a result of the various steps taken by the commission as well as marketing strategies of the PFAs. It said the pension industry recorded a 0.45 per cent growth (41,074) in the scheme membership during the second quarter of 2020, moving from 9.06 million contributors at the end of the preceding quarter to 9.1million. The growth in the industry membership was driven by the RSA scheme, which had an increase of 41,147 contributors representing 0.46 per cent. However, it added, membership of the Closed Pension Fund Administration scheme declined by 73 members to 17,125 while the Approved Existing Scheme membership remained unchanged at 40,951 as at the second quarter of 2020.

The 4,937 organisations that were issued certificates remitted the sum of N19.39m into the RSAs of 67,692 employees. explained the Approved Existing Schemes as pension schemes existing prior to the introduction of the Contributory Pension Scheme in June, 2004 and were approved to continue as AES.
