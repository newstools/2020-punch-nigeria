Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State Government on Friday said it had approved the reconstruction of 12 roads which cover 43.61km in all the three Senatorial districts of the state. The state Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Ade Adesanya, made this disclosure to journalists at a press briefing in Oke-Mosan. He said the governor gave the approval for the roads at the State Executive Council meeting held on Thursday. Adesanya said the roads would be completed between six and nine months. He said, “Yesterday (Thursday), the Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, approved the reconstruction of 12 roads. Some of these roads were already on our table. The roads will serve as links and alternative roads to reduce traffic congestion on major roads. “They were roads picked by people of the state and the governor gave an aggressive schedule that the roads be completed between six and nine months. “We still have about 40 roads to go. Most of these roads, as mandated by the exco, will be finished between six and nine months.” The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Waheed Odusile, also added that the move was to provide access for easy transportation of agricultural products from the rural areas to cities. Both Adesanya and Odusile were, however, silent on the estimated cost for the reconstruction of the roads. Copyright PUNCH.
