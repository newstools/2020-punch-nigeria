The European Union’s diplomatic chief on Monday welcomed President Donald Trump’s announcement that he is ready to remove Sudan from a US blacklist of state sponsors of terrorism. The move, a major boost for Sudan’s civilian-backed government after decades as an international pariah, came after Khartoum agreed to a $335 million compensation package for victims and relatives of past attacks, Trump wrote on Twitter. EU foreign affairs high representative Josep Borrell said the proposed delisting was recognition of Sudan’s progress under Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. “US intention to lift the State Sponsor of Terrorism designation of #Sudan is momentous,” Borrell wrote on Twitter. “It enhances its (Sudan’s) integration into international community and access to world economy. EU fully supports Sudan transition.” READ ALSO: How power slipped from Jonathan before hand over — Reuben Abati Sudan is one of four nations branded by Washington as a state sponsor of terrorism along with Iran, North Korea and Syria — severely impeding economic development, with few major foreign investors willing to run afoul of US laws.
