Dayo Ojerinde The Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Health Institution, Dr Paschal Obi, has urged the Federal Government to replicate the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority-Lagos University Teaching Hospital Cancer Centre in other parts of the country. Obi, during an oversight visit to LUTH on Monday, said the building of more cancer centres in the country would be in the overall interest of Nigerians, the NSIA-LUTH facility was not enough to serve cancer patients across the country. He said, “We are impressed with what we met on the ground. We understand that the LUTH-NSIA is a Public-Private Partnership arrangement. “We are pleading with the Federal Government to continue to partner NSIA to ensure that a facility of this magnitude and stature is replicated in other parts of the country.” Obi also urged the LUTH management to address the expansion of its Accident and Emergency Centre, noting that other old structures in the hospital should be rehabilitated. “Overstretched facilities, obviously are here; for an institution that started 58 years ago, it is not out of place to have such structure here,” Obi said. The Chief Medical Director of the hospital, Prof. Chris Bode, called for support of the committee for the expansion of the hospital’s Accident and Emergency centre. He said there was the need to expand the ward to expand service delivery to patients. Copyright PUNCH.
