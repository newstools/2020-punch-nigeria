The Deputy Governor of Nasarawa State, Emmanuel Akabe; former Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State as well as serving ministers and senators were also present. Tinubu had on September 5, 2020, alongside a former Governor of Osun State, Chief Bisi Akande; visited Akure to help launch Akeredoluâ€™s re-election campaign. The APC leader was actively involved in the September 19, 2020, Edo State governorship election, which the APC candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, lost. A few days before the election, Tinubu published a video calling on the people of the state to reject Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party at the polls. However, the move failed. Following the defeat of the APC in Edo State, Tinubu has adopted a more tacit approach in Ondo State.
