Temiloluwa O’Peters The Lagos State Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Uzamat Akinbile-Yussuf, has said more efforts would be channeled towards the development of the state’s local tourism sites and promotion of local creativity. The commissioner said this at the Sweet 6ixty event organised by Fly Africa, an initiative of Outori Limited, in conjunction with the Lagos State Government. A statement issued by the company on Saturday said the event saw the making of the largest anniversary logo in the world with 60,000 cupcakes, breaking a Guinness World record. Akinbile-Yussuf said rather than enriching other countries through international tour, they wanted to change the narrative by making the state a beautiful city where international tourists could visit and invest their money. “Lagos State occupies a significant position in the history of this country economically, historically, financially and numerically, that is why the state is often referred to as a mini-Nigeria,” she added. The Managing Director, Fly Africa/Outori Limited, Wole Olagundoye, said the initiative was created to inspire and educate Africans through live experiences to rise up to their potential by taking actions that would move the continent forward. “Only Africans can make Africa succeed; our own destiny is not in the hand of other nations but right in ours, and we must seize this moment to make the necessary change,” he said. The statement added that the event was monitored by officials of the Guinness Book of Records where 150 volunteers arranged 60,000 cupcakes into the world’s largest anniversary logo. Copyright PUNCH.
