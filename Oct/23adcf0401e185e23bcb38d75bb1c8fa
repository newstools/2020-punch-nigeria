Olufemi Olaniyi and Abiodun Nejo The police, soldiers and other security agencies on Thursday engaged in a ‘show of force’ ahead of the governorship election holding across Ondo State on Saturday. Armed policemen, soldiers and members of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps mounted armoured personnel carriers and vans, as they patrolled Akure and other towns in the state to warn hoodlums and those who might want to cause violence during the poll. Our correspondent observed that dozens of security patrol vans mounted by soldiers moved through some major streets blaring siren as they moved along the roads. There have been clashes during electioneering and many believe that there will be violence on Saturday if hoodlums reportedly engaged by certain persons are not cleared off the streets. Election observer groups have also warned that if the pre-election security threats are not neutralised before the poll, there may be violence which will affect the turn out of voters. The  Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the election, Mr Leye Oyebade, had, however, assured that security agencies would not allow anybody to disrupt the election or cause violence anywhere in the state.
