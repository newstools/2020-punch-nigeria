Oladimeji Ramon THE Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, has commiserated with families of those who lost their lives and those injured in violence that greeted the #EndSARS protests across the country. He described as unfortunate the burning of Atan Ota Police Station and the killing of the Divisional Crime Officer and one other person. While suing for calm, Abiodun said he might be forced to introduce stringent measures if acts of breach of public safety and security continued. The governor said these in a statement on Wednesday titled, ‘EndSARS: Gov Abiodun condoles with families, sues for calm’. “While calling for demonstrators to bring the protests to an end and allow for the full implementation of their demands, Abiodun urged security agents to exercise caution in dealing with #EndSARS protesters to avoid further loss of lives and properties,” the statement read in part.
