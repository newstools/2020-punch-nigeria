James Abraham, Jos Sympathisers on Saturday thronged the Rayfield Medical Centre in Jos, where the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the Plateau State University, Dr Jurji Gomos was moved to after his release by kidnappers. Among the sympathisers was the Chairman of the institution’s branch of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, Dr Pamson Bentse, who described the DVC’s release as miraculous. Bentse said, “I just left the hospital a while ago. He is doing well. We thank God for sparing the life of our Deputy Vice-Chancellor in the hands of kidnappers.” The DVC was kidnapped on Friday by gunmen who broke into his house in the Bukuru community area of the state and whisked him away to an unknown destination.
