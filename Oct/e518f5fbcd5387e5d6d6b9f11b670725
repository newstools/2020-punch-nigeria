He expressed worry over the danger of petroleum tankers meandering through bad roads, saying it could cause loss of lives. He said, “We have met with the government on the need to fix the bad roads but nothing concrete came out. This is why we had to come out with this ultimatum. If by the end of the week we don’t see workers fixing the road, we will ask our tankers to stop lifting petroleum products.”
