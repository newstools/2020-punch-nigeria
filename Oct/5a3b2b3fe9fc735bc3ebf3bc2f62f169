Friday Olokor, Abuja The Nigeria Union of Journalists, FCT council, on Sunday protested against the activities of the task force/marshal of the Abuja Municipal Area Council. The union expressed concerned over the illegal arrest of vehicles and their owners by the AMAC task force. Already, the NUJ has concluded plans to hold a town hall meeting with relevant stakeholders and residents. A statement by the Secretary of NUJ, Ochiaka Ugwu, and Chairman of the Planning Committee, Omeiza Ajayi, informed that the event would take place on Monday, October 19, 2020 at the NUJ FCT council secretariat, Utako, by 10am. The NUJ said the town hall meeting had become imperative following widespread complaints by motorists alleging abuse, extortion, intimidation and sometimes physical abuse by operatives/officials of the AMAC task force/marshal. The statement read, “Many journalists had fallen victims before now and the bail is usually 10,000. Based on the constitutional guarantee in Chapter 22 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the NUJ FCT views it as expedient to organise a town hall meeting to review the strategies of the AMAC task force/marshal and develop interventions to ensure that key stakeholders are engaged and informed on their activities. “It is also aimed at finding answers to burning issues which, if not properly addressed and timely, too, could adversely impact on the fragile security situation in the territory.” Copyright PUNCH.
