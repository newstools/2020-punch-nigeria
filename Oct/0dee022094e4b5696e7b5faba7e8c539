Peter Dada, Akure The governorship candidate of the Zenith Labour Party in the October 10 Ondo State governorship election, Mr Agboola Ajayi, has accused Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of mismanaging funds meant for the development of oil-rich regions of the state. Ajayi, who is also the deputy governor of the state, made the allegation barely 10 days to the governorship election. He levelled the allegation while speaking during his campaign in Igbokoda and Igbekebo the headquarters of the Ilaje and Ese Odo Local Governments Areas of the state respectively, late on Tuesday. He said, “God will not forgive those who steal our funds in OSOPADEC. It is unfortunate that this government cannot point to one project executed with our fund in the past three and half years.” In response, the state Commissioner for Information, Mr Donald Ojogo, said Ajayi was being economical with the truth on the OSOPADEC matter. Ojogo said, “Untruths alone do not make impact. Ajayi as a major contractor in OSOPADEC may as well provide evidence to back up his claim. The people of the state know how much of lies he has told them. “He cannot be trusted for anything but disingenuous mischief. A man so full of controversies can only be forgiven whether he tells another lie to sustain and keep an illusion afloat. We can only sympathise with his vaulting ambition.” Copyright PUNCH.
