Johnny Edward UFC star Israel Adesanya says he is keen on fighting again this year, following his victory against Paulo Costa at the weekend. The 31-year-old silenced his critics with a comprehensive win over the Brazillian, who was undefeated before the bout. The win stretched his MMA pro record to 20-0. Following his dominant second-round win, Adesanya says he is still fresh for another fight, but admits his foot still hurts. “I don’t know, I’ve got to talk to the big dog,” Adesanya said on Ariel Helwasni MMA Show on Wednesday. “This year, I want to fight this year. We talked a little a bit last night and I can’t say much more but we’ve got some plans, I want to fight this year. I’m fresh. My foot only hurts from kicking.” In a year overshadowed by cancelled events due to the coronavirus crisis, Adesanya has fought twice, the first being the win over Yoel Romero at UFC 248.
