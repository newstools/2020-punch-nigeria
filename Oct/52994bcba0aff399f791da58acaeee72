Bola Bamigbola, Akure Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Ondo governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede, has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission of “creating a problem”. He, however, said despite the hitches, he would win. Before he eventually voted, Smart Card Reader could not read his card and he was asked to step aside for other voters to vote. Smart Card Reader could not also read PVC of Eno, Jegede’s wife but his daughter voted without any hitch. The machine had worked perfectly until when Jegede and the wife were to cast their votes. After about 10 minutes, Jegede and his wife voted about 11:10 am, after the machine was rectified. Speaking to newsmen after voting, Jegede accused INEC of creating a problem, saying the commission should be asked why the card reader stopped functioning when it was his turn to vote. He said, “INEC is creating a problem. Their machine stopped working when it was my turn to vote. I had to protest and they said the machine was rectified. But despite all these hitches, there has not been major disruption. But I don’t know what is happening in remote areas. “The turnout has been massive, voters conducted themselves well. I am aware that there is pocket of violence in Ijomu area. “I also heard of an incident of vote-buying.”
