Ife Ogunfuwa The Nigerian Communications Commission has secured court convictions of seven persons for SIM-card-related offences. The commission, in a statement by the Director, Public Affairs, Dr Ikechukwu Adinde, on Sunday said this was achieved through the joint efforts of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corp and the Department of State Services. The NCC said the seven convicts were charged and convicted at the Grade 1 Area Court Nyanya, Abuja and the Senior Magistrate Court, Kano for offences bordering on violation of SIM registration laws. The regulatory body identified the offenders as Bako Joseph, Umar Abdullahi, Lawal Sani, Shamsuddin Aliyu, George Eze, Ayuba Ishak, and Kabiru Ali. Specifically, the NCC said the first convict, Bako Joseph, was charged with the sale of SIM cards outside a controlled environment, while the other six were arraigned on the charge of the sale of fraudulently-registered SIM cards. It said the offences were contrary to section 517 of the Criminal Code Act; Section 65 (1) of the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA) 2003 and Section 65 (2) of the NCC Act, 2003 and punishable under the same Act. The commission added that the suspects pleaded guilty to the charge against them and were subsequently convicted and sentenced to two months imprisonment with an option to pay a fine of N15,000 and six months imprisonment or the option of fine in the sum of N20,000. According to the commission, the use of pre-registered SIM cards gives cover for unwholesome activities like kidnapping, call masking, threat to lives, bullying, armed robbery, identity theft financial crimes and SIM swap fraud, among others.
