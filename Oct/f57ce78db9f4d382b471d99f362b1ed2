Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Kingmakers of Zazzau Emirate are currently engaged in a fresh process to recommend candidates for the office of the 19th Fulani Emir of Zazzau. A statement by Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Muyiwa Adekeye, on Wednesday quoted the the Secretary to the State Government, Balarabe Abbas Lawal, as saying this. The SSG  explained that the Kaduna State Government directed a new round of the selection process following the cancellation of the initial process, which excluded two interested applicants. “The Bunu Zazzau complained that he was unable to submit his application because he was told that the window for receipt of applications had closed. The Sarkin Dajin Zazzau also protested his exclusion from the process. It was also noted that the kingmakers assessed two candidates on 24th September 2020 without sighting their CVs which the selectors received a day later,” the statement said. Copyright PUNCH.
