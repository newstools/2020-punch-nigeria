Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Oyo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has attacked its All Progressives Congress counterpart for allegedly describing a statement by Governor Seyi Makinde as “senseless”. The APC had, in an October 11 statement by its Publicity Secretary, AbdulAzeez Olatunde, asked the governor to publicly apologise to the people of Oyo State for allegedly ridiculing the state by meddling in the appointment of the Chief Returning Officer for the Ondo State governorship election. “Honestly, Governor Seyi Makinde is daily telling the whole world with his public utterances that he won the 2019 election fraudulently,” the APC spokesman had said. In response, the PDP, in a statement on Monday by its state Publicity Secretary, Akeem Olatunji, described the APC as a party with an unbridled penchant for seeking public attention. Olatunji said, “The Oyo APC, through its Publicity Secretary, AbdulAzeez Olatunde, threw caution to the wind in the name of politics by calling the governor ‘senseless’; wouldn’t it have been polite and respectful in the spirit of playing opposition to apply decorum in their choices of words especially when addressing the governor? “We are not unaware of their source of unrestrained effrontery and guts, being the party in control at the centre, to disrespect, disparage, malign, and bring the hard-earned reputation of Governor Makinde to disrepute in the eyes of the members of the public. “It is also a public knowledge that even while the governor was in Ondo performing his legitimate party duty, good governance in the state continued uninterruptedly.”
