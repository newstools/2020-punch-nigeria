Matthew Ochei, Asaba Six inmates have escaped from the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development Remand Home and Detention Centre in Sapele, Delta State. The inmates, all male with age ranging from 14–17 years were said to have escaped from the home along Abeke road in Sapele, in the early hours of Wednesday. A source at the home told our correspondent on the condition of anonymity that the inmates escaped about 12:30 am. “I think it was a carefully planned escaped by the six inmates. They chose night so that they could escape without being noticed before dawn. If not for the swift intervention of the security men and the vigilantes, the remaining inmates would have escaped also,” the source said. The Remand home is said to be housing 14 inmates, with 13 being male and one female in the facility. The Police Public Relations Officer, Onome Onowakpoyeya, on Thursday, confirmed the escape of the teenagers. She said, “Yes, six inmates escaped and the command is doing everything possible to find them.”
