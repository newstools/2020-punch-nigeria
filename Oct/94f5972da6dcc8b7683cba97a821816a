Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, on Tuesday visited the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Akeredolu, who secured his second term by winning the last Saturday’s governorship election in the state, also presented his certificate of return to the President. He was accompanied by the state deputy governor-elect, Lucky Ayedatiwa; and the governors of Lagos, Kebbi, Ekiti and Jigawa states. Akeredolu told State House correspondent that his victory was achieved by the sense of unity displayed by leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress, including state governors elected on the party’s platform. He added that his victory proved that “Ondo is not Edo.” The governor was making reference to defeated if the APC in Edo State by Peoples Democratic Party during the last month’s governorship election in the state. He said, “So, we have gone to prove in Ondo that Ondo is not Edo. They were dreaming. Now, they must have woken from their slumber. Ondo is not Edo. We have proven that. This is only possible with all of us working together.” Akeredolu called on his current deputy, Agboola Ajayi, to resign if he still has any honour in him. Ahead of the election, Ajayi defected from the APC first to the PDP and later to the Zenith Labour Party. He contested the election against Akeredolu on the platform of the ZLP and came third after Eyitayo Jegede of the PDP. The governor said even if Ajayi refused to resign, his days are numbered since a new deputy would soon be inaugurated. Copyright PUNCH.
