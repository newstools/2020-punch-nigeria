’Tosin Oluwalowo The non-disclosure of new Super Falcons coach Randy Waldrum’s contract details by the Nigeria Football Federation has been condemned by former players of the women’s national team, The PUNCH reports. The NFF on October 5 announced Waldrum as the new coach of the Falcons, without disclosing his tenure and financial details of the contract. Findings by The PUNCH showed that the American would combine the Falcons job with his coaching role at Pittsburgh University’s women’s team in the US. Former Falcons goalkeeper, Judith Chime, said NFF’s action smacked of disrespect for Nigerians. “You hire somebody and we don’t have full details of the contract, what are we supposed to do with that? All we know is that you hired him, what of the terms of the contract? Nigerians need to tell themselves, enough is enough. We are tired of being used ignorantly,” Chime said. “That is actually the problem we have, we don’t respect what we have. We cherish what others have rather than ours.” Another ex-Falcons star, Seun Bello, added, “It’s wrong that the details of the manager’s contract are not made public. After all, he would be paid with taxpayers’ money.” “I will like to know if Randy will be paid for the job because it appears he is taking the job as a pet project. I don’t understand why the most successful team in Africa will settle for a part-time coach who will keep his job as a university coach and still manage the Falcons,” Enuesike Samuel wrote on Twitter.
