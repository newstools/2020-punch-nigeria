Peter Dada, Akure The Chairman of the South-West Governors’ Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, has condemned the Saturday’s attack on the Governor of Osun State, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola by some suspected#EndSARS protesters in Osogbo. Akeredolu described the attack as an act of terrorism, which is condemnable. This was contained in a statement issued by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, to the governor, Mr Ojo Oyewamide, on Sunday. The statement was titled, ‘EndSARS: ‘Attack on Oyetola, a condemnable act of terrorism.’ According to the statement, the governor said the genuine movement was already being hijacked by politicians to visit their frustrations on perceived opponents. The statement read,” Undoubtedly, the #EndSARS movement had had a popular and receptive attitude to it by majority of Nigerians, including policy makers, who have seen in it, an opportunity to deepen concern and redirect efforts towards veritable reforms aimed at achieving positive results. “All the same, the desirability or otherwise of this movement appears to have come under a curious integrity test following the misdirected anger visited on Governor Oyetola. This act is a clear act of terrorism under the guise of a civil and supposedly peaceful protest that has been hijacked by criminals and hoodlums hired by politicians. This is more so, that dangerous weapons were said to have been deployed in the ignoble act. “Nothing more describes and represents this pernicious act as repulsive. It is, therefore, pertinent to call on the organisers to rein in stakeholders involved in the #EndSARS protests so as to stratify between those with genuine, altruistic desires for reforms and elements who have offered themselves as mercenaries to unleash mayhem on innocent people.” Akeredolu warned the youths not to be useful tools in the hands of politicians “at this trying period.”
