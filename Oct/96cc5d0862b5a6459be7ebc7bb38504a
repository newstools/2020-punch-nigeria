Sodiq Oyeleke African Action Congress has denied endorsing the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Eyitayo Jegede, in the Ondo State Governorship election. The National Chairman of the party, Omoyele Sowore, made this known in a statement on Tuesday. The denial is coming a few hours after representatives of 11 political parties declared their support for the PDP’s candidate. Sowore faulted the reported endorsement, describing it as “unholy”. The statement, which was tweeted by Sowore, was titled ‘The African Action Congress (AAC) denies endorsing Jegede for Ondo Election’. Part of the statement read, “Our attention has been drawn to a false publication across the media about 11 political parties endorsing @OfficialPDPNig candidate Eyitayo Jegede in the forthcoming Ondo gubernatorial election in which our dear party @aacParty was also falsely reported to be part of the unholy endorsement. “We want to make it categorically clear and loud that as a revolutionary party, we are not and will never be part of an alliance or endorsement which only objective and goal is to continue to weaponise poverty and keep Nigerians in 21st-century slavery. “We distance completely from this unholy alliance and also want to use this opportunity to appeal to all members and supporters of our dear party including the general public to disregard the information being peddled around the media space. The @aacparty is a party of oppressed Nigerians (poor and working people) and will continue to fight and stand with the masses.”
