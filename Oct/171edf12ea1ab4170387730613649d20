The Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, says his performance as a governor has shown that not all politicians in Nigeria are liars. He also said if re-elected for another term, Akure, the state capital, will be connected to the global economy. He said this during his visitation to the Deji of Akure and Paramount Ruler of Akure Kingdom, Oba Ogunlade Aladelusi, in his palace on Tuesday. Akeredolu said he didn’t join politics to maximise wealth but to show that not all political actors are liars. He sad, “By the grace of God, Akure will be connected to the global economy before I leave government. I want to prove that not all politicians are liars and I have proven that. I will never betray my belief. I will continue to do what is right, and not what is good. Like I do say, I want history to be kind to me. “Akure airport is already designated as an international cargo airport. That will soon happen. We will construct Igbatoro road. Akure will be more modernised in our second term.” Deji of Akure and Paramount Ruler of Akure Kingdom, Oba Ogunlade Aladelusi, commended Akeredolu for projects executed under his administration. The monarch said Akeredolu fulfilled his promises to the people of Akure kingdom, adding that “whoever says Governor Akeredolu has not performed, particularly in Akure would only be lying on what is visible.”
