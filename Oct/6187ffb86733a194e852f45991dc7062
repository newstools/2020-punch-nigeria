Joseph Olaoluwa Toyota Nigeria Limited plans to launch a new entry-level vehicle before the end of the year. Managing Director, Mr Kunle Ade-Ojo, stated this at the 2020 edition of the company’s annual customers’ award, where the Department of Petroleum Resources, Nigeria Customs Service and First Bank of Nigeria, among others, were honoured for being loyal to the brand. Ade-Ojo said the new entry-level vehicle would come ‘at a friendly price’. The TNL boss, however, did not reveal the name of the new product and its other details. He said also hinted that the company planned to ‘stage a fleet conference that will unveil plans being put together by the TNL to continue to serve the best interest of its teeming customers in the country’. He assured customers of the company’s commitment to continue to meet their expectations at every customer touch point. Representatives of all the winning organisations expressed appreciation for TNL’s recognition and reward of their patronage. Copyright PUNCH.
