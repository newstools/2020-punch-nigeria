Sodiq Oyeleke and Adeyinka Adedipe At least two persons died when hoodlums attacked #EndSARS protesters at Ring Road, Benin, in Edo State on Friday. The hoodlums, who stormed the venue of the protest, attacked the protesters with machetes and other weapons. The protesting youths were calling on the government to end impunity and police brutality. The PUNCH gathered that some of the attackers, who sell tickets, at the Ring Road motor park, were furious over low patronage since the protest began in the Edo State capital. Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, confirmed the killings without giving the exact number of casualties. He, however, said “lives” were lost. In a series of tweets after the incident, the governor condemned the attack on #EndSARS protesters. He said, “I have just learnt that hoodlums have attacked #ENDSARS protesters, who have conducted themselves peacefully in Benin City. I extend condolences to the victims of the attacks, including those who lost their lives and others who were injured by the thugs.  “It is disheartening that anyone would attack a peaceful assembly of young people who are expressing genuine concerns over police brutality and intimidation in their own country. “Thorough investigation would be conducted immediately to fish out the culprits of the attack on peaceful #EndSARS protesters in Benin City, and we would do all possible within the law to ensure those culpable are brought to justice. “I hereby call on the Edo State Police Command to get out on the streets and provide adequate security for the protesters and ensure that no one is harassed in the course of exercising their rights.”
