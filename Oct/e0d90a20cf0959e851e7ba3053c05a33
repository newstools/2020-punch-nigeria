Abiodun Nejo, and Wale Oyewale The media aide to former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, Lere Olayinka, has alleged that the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde ,sponsored thee thugs who assaulted his principal on Wednesday. Some persons had removed Fayose’s cap during the grand finale of the Peoples Democratic Party governorship campaign rally in Akureon Wednesday. Olayinka in a statement said, “Fayose was making his way to the podium at the campaign ground when a hoodlum, ostensibly acting on instruction, moved towards him and removed his cap. That’s how late Chief Bola Ige’s cap was removed in Ile Ife, Osun State then and we all know what happened later. “The masterminds had it all planned and they followed it up by celebrating what they saw as the success of their plot. They even capped it up by circulating the video. “Fayose has accused the Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde of masterminding the assault on him at the party’s campaign rally for the Ondo State governorship election in Ondo town.” In response, Taiwo Adisa, the Chief Press Secretary to the Oyo State governor said “I believe that ex-governor Fayose and his handlers need to look far away from Oyo State in search of their enemies. Governor Makinde has no link with the incident Fayose’s aide was talking about. “We expect all right- thinking members of the PDP to join the Governor of Oyo State in the prosecution of the noble and democratic assignment he is executing on behalf of the PDP in Ondo State at this time instead of seeking to distract him.
