Dayo Ojerinde The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has said politicians must prioritise governance to benefit the people. Obaseki, who said this in Benin City on Thursday, added that he was not in government to be famous or make money at the expense of ensuring development that would benefit the people. The governor, according to a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Crusoe Osagie, noted that there was the need for a mechanism to be put in place to ensure transparency in government, He said, “Only few persons in government are held accountable for their decisions in government. “I am not in government to make money; I am not in government for fame. I am in government to serve. Our youths are the reasons why I am in government. If I cannot serve you, I will quit. “The issues of better government, proper governance and transparency are what we are emphasising. When we have younger people who can use technology in government, we will have transparency and accountability, which informed my decision to have many younger people working in my government.” Obaseki called for a strong institution that would ensure law and order. He said, “And that is why we have the security agencies. Our security arrangement in the country must reflect our federal system as I can’t be a governor of a state and not able to hire and fire my Commissioner of Police, but #ENDSARS protests have helped us start the process.” Copyright PUNCH.
