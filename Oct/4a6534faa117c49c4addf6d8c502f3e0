Dayo Ojerinde The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has charged residents of the state to continue to observe the COVID-19 precautionary measures, stating that the pandemic is yet to be over. Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by his wife, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, said this at the inauguration of COVID-19 Holding Bay and High Care Unit for suspected cases at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja. He said the 20-bed capacity bay was crucial to the fight against COVID-19 in the state. “While our efforts at managing the pandemic have been largely successful considering the number of cases that have been successfully treated and the reduction in the number of new cases, it is important to emphasise that now is not the time for us to rest on our oars, but rather a time to remain conscious of the pandemic and to continue to intensify efforts at flattening the curve,” Sanwo-Olu said. The Chief Medical Director, LASUTH, Prof. Adetokunbo Fabamwo, said the COVID-19 relief bay was built to save patients and other workers in the hospital from being exposed to COVID-19. He said the COVID-19 holding area and high care unit had  provision for six intensive care units with high technology medical equipment and personnel that would provide specialised care services. Fabamwo added that the hospital would provide advance care through the high care unit to COVID-19 patients with respiratory tissue challenges and ensure they were  treated properly. Copyright PUNCH.
