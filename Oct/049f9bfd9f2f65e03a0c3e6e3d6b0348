Ade Adesomoju, Abuja THE Upper Area Court, Kubwa, Abuja on Tuesday ordered Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to hand over the custody of his three sons to his divorced wife and mother of the children. Atikuâ€™s ex-wife, Sherif, had instituted the suit against Abubakar, who is a son of a former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, urging the court to grant her the right of custody of their three children, who currently reside with her ex-husband. The judge, Bashir Danmaisule, granted her prayers in a judgment on Tuesday. He ruled that there was no basis to deprive her of the custody of her children under Islamic law. He said appeal would be allowed within the next 30 days. Sherif and her lawyer, Nasir Saidu, were present in court, but Abubakar and his lawyer, Abdullahi Hassan, were absent. Copyright PUNCH.
