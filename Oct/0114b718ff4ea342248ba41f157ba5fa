Kayode Oyero The Federal Government has approved the reopening of the Marine Beach Bridge and the Eko Bridge in Lagos State. The government had shut the Eko Bridge and Marine Beach Bridge in March and May respectively for repairs while declaring it unsafe for public use. But the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, SAN, on Saturday, directed that both bridges be reopened to traffic from Monday, October 19, 2020. This was contained in a statement signed by the ministry’s Director of Press and Publicity, Boade Akinola. The statement was titled, ‘After Emergency Repairs By FG, Fashola Approves Reopening Of Eko, Marine Bridges On Monday’. It read, “After concluding urgently needed repair works on Eko and Marine Bridges in Lagos, the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, SAN, has directed that both bridges be reopened to traffic on Monday, October 19, 2020.” The minister explained that the approval for the reopening of both bridges “was sequel to the report by the contractor handling the projects, Messrs. Buildwell Plant & Equipment Industries Limited that the repair works on the first phase had been completed 100 per cent.” He thanked Lagosians for their patience, understanding and cooperation while sections of the bridges were closed. Fashola added that “while the completed section of the Eko Bridge (Lagos Island Bound) should be reopened to traffic, work should commence immediately on the Alaka Bound side of the project.” Just like the Third Mainland Bridge which has had one of its sections closed for repairs, the 1,350-metre Eko Bridge links the Lagos Island to the Mainland while the Marine Bridge connects motorists to the Apapa area of the city.
