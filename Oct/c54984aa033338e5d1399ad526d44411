Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The leadership of Oodua Peoples Congress in Osun State, on Thursday, vowed to assist the state government to recover items looted by hoodlums in different parts of the state last Saturday. The group also promised that hoodlums hiding in some areas in the state would be apprehended and handed over to the police. Speaking to The PUNCH in Osogbo, the Osun State OPC Coordinator, Prince Adedeji Aladesawe, who condemned the unrest experienced in some parts of the state, however, commended the youth for expressing their displeasure against police brutality through a peaceful protest. He frowned on the activities of miscreants that later hijacked the peaceful protest and caused unrest in the state. Aladesawe said, “It is unfortunate that the peaceful protests ended abruptly with hoodlums using same to destroy and loot both public and private properties. “However, the good thing about this protest is that the youths are able to pass their message across to our leaders with a five-point agenda for police reform and social justice. “It is sad that the raging crisis also affected our traditional heritage and  institutions. We are assuring government of our readiness to recover all the looted items. We are using our knowledge of all parts of the state in achieving this. We are also going to support the police and other security agencies to ensure peace in the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
