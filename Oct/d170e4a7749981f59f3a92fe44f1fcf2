Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Sunday said it would support farmers across the country with interest-free loans. Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono, said his ministry would work with the Central Bank of Nigeria in providing the loans. Nanono stated this while receiving the 2020 Wet Agricultural Performance Survey, according to a statement issued by an information official of his ministry, Ezeaja Ikemefuna, in Abuja on Sunday. “The ministry would support the farmers with agricultural inputs and zero interest loans through the Central Bank of Nigeria and other financial institutions to mitigate the effect of the COVID-19 and the recent flooding especially in Kebbi, Jigawa and Kano States,” the minister stated. On the survey, he said the exercise had shown that effective input subsidisation would boost productivity in the agricultural sector. He urged farmers to intensify efforts and focus on achieving more successes during the dry season farming in order to cushion the loses caused by the pandemic. Copyright PUNCH.
