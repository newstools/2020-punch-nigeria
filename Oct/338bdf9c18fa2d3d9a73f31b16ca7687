Temiloluwa O’Peters Heads of built environment regulatory agencies in Nigeria under the Forum of Regulatory Bodies of Built Environment in Nigeria have deplored inadequate local content in projects across the country. FORBBEN, consisting of seven regulatory bodies, met recently in Abuja during which they discussed sundry issues confronting the real sector. The President of the forum, Dipo Ajayi, said the country’s housing challenges could be better tackled by designing and adopting local content approaches. He noted that no nation thrived mainly on importation of either the materials or the services and called for the law on local content to be implemented to the letter. Ajayi also urged members of the group to work towards eliminating their differences to scale up professionalism within the sector. The regulatory bodies resolved to align towards uplifting professionalism and engaging the Federal Government on the nation’s local content law. The forum also noted the need for all the regulatory bodies to be on budget line and advised on the enforcement of discipline among members. FORBBEN charged members to avoid misunderstanding, noting that all projects in the built environment could accommodate all professionals involved in the build environment. The group includes Architects Registration Council of Nigeria, Estate Surveyors and Valuers Registration Board of Nigeria, Town Planners Registration Council of Nigeria and the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria. Others are Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria, Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria and Surveyors Council of Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH.
