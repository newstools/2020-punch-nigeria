Sodiq Oyeleke A former Commissioner for Home Affairs in Lagos State, Dr AbdulHakeem AbdulLateef, has resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress. In his Independence Day message, AbdulLateef said his decision to resign was due to the rejection of his movement and governorship ambition by some “close leaders” he respected in the party. The one-time lawmaker launched “Iyepe 2023” on Tuesday, a movement he said would galvanise Lagosians to develop more interest in politics and curb voter apathy. The action led to the termination of his appointment as the Special Adviser to the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly on Religious Affairs. The former commissioner said, “I am an indigene of Lagos state and an Awori by birth. I, therefore, have a duty to take positive steps, including admonitions and practical reorientation of our people towards the ideal society we crave for. “This movement has been rejected by some close leaders I respect. I have, therefore, decided to leave the party in order not to create disunity within the party. Please do not persecute or victimise my followers who have chosen to stay in APC.” Copyright PUNCH.
