Temiloluwa O’Peters The National Board for Technical Education and the Architects Registration Council of Nigeria have signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the accreditation of programmes in technical institutions under the board’s purview. According to a statement issued by ARCON on Saturday, with the MoU, the body would now be licensing all products of accredited polytechnics in Nigeria, as architectural technologists. The statement said the accord between NBTE and ARCON existed but was suspended about five years ago. According to ARCON, the MoU was a resuscitation of the programme between the parties. The MoU assented to visitations to polytechnics, colleges of technology, technical colleges and similar institutions for purposes of accreditation, re-accreditation, resources inspections and advisory visits by NBTE and ARCON representatives. It also assented to a joint template for accreditation, encompassing academic and professional aspects of the training to be evolved. “With effect from the date of this memorandum, all the architecture programmes accredited by NBTE will enjoy ARCON recognition until they are due for re-accreditation,” the memorandum stated. According to the statement, programmes of visitation would be drawn up periodically and funded by NBTE while ARCON would be informed and would appoint its representatives to the programmes. It added that each fully accredited programme in the institutions would be revisited at least once every three years. Copyright PUNCH.
