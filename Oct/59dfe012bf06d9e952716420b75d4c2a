Oladimeji Ramon The candidate of the All Progressives Congress for the Lagos East senatorial bye-election, Mr Tokunbo Abiru, has asked the Inspector-General of Police, Mr Mohammed Adamu, to investigate the attempted murder allegation levelled against him by his counterpart in the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Babatunde Gbadamosi. Abiru said the police needed to expose and apprehend those who made an attempt on the lives of the PDP candidate and members of his campaign team. He made this demand in an October 12 letter by his counsel, Mr Kemi Pinheiro (SAN), to the IG On two different occasions, Gbadamosi had on his Twitter handle, @Gbadamosi, asked the APC candidate “to warn members of his campaign team against murder and assassination. This is the second attempt against us.” Gbadamosi had alleged that one of his activists “was almost assassinated by four gunmen, who admitted that they had been trailing him for some time. He barely escaped with his life.” In the two-page letter to the IG, Abiru described Gbadamosi’s allegations as grave, and urged the police “to institute a detailed investigation that would basically ascertain the veracity of the allegations made publicly by the PDP candidate against him.” He said, “If the allegations turn out to be false, the police boss should not hesitate to institute legal actions as contained in the cybercrime law, Criminal Code Act and Criminal Law of Lagos State.” Copyright PUNCH.
