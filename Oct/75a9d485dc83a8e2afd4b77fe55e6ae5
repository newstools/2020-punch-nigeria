‘Femi Asu The Eko Electricity Distribution Company has said it is not responsible for the supply of power to the Lekki Toll Gate where some protesters were shot on Tuesday night. The EKEDC, in a statement on Wednesday, denied allegations that it took power supply from the Admiralty Toll Plaza on Lekki-Epe expressway on Tuesday night. According to the statement signed by the company’s General Manager, Corporate Communications, Mr Godwin Idemudia, Lagos State had contracted the supply of electricity to the plaza and the street lights to an Independent Power Plant. Idemudia said, “We will like to respectfully and categorically state that EKEDC does not handle power supply to the Lekki Toll Gate and they independently generate their own power supply through IPPs. “The rest of the Lekki area supplied by EKEDC had power supply from us throughout the night save for any areas where there were technical faults.” He added, “We are extremely saddened by the turn of events yesterday (Tuesday) and we stand with all well-meaning Nigerians who want a better future for our dear nation. “EKEDC management vows to continue to provide best possible electricity supply, customer service and fault resolution for as long as it is safe for our staff to leave their homes/families and arrive at their work locations safely.” Copyright PUNCH.
