Umahi, who made the appeal on Friday during an address to the people of the state, insisted that the country needed to move forward after the killings and destruction of valuable properties. The governor urged the youths to particularly, forgive the “unwarranted’’ and regrettable’ shooting of unarmed protesters at the Lekki toll gate, Lagos, as the south-east leaders were pained over the incident. “Our hearts go to the families of the deceased, and we enjoin the Federal and Lagos State Governments to quicken investigation into the incident. “It was an act of the devil and the infrastructure being destroyed across the country are for you as leaders of the future. “You need to be alive to actualise this future because some of you will be presidents, governors, lawmakers, and ministers among others. “No one lives on earth forever, so, we seek your forgiveness so that we will go back to the drawing board,” he said. He urged state governments to draw youths closer to their administrations to enable them to have a say in the scheme of things. “Youths should be brought closer to issues of budgeting, dynamics, and difficulties of governance among others to enable us to have a better society. “I appeal to our people to withdraw from the #EndSARS protest because it is no longer a protest but an orchestrated violence with people imported from other states to destroy lives and properties,” he said. Umahi appealed to leaders across Nigeria to do everything possible to maintain peace within their domains as those of the south-east would continue to ensure that everybody living within the zone was protected. “This is a critical moment in the nation’s history and we cannot continue to see the critical private and public infrastructure we laboured to build being destroyed. “Considering the dwindling revenue of the country, such infrastructure contributes greatly to the sustenance of the economy,” he said.
