Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State House of Assembly has grilled one of the aides of former Governor Ibikunle Amosun over alleged sharp practices perpetrated at the Ogun Property and Investment Corporation. The House Committee on Public Accounts and Anti-Corruption had invited the aide, Babajide Odusolu, who was a former Special Adviser and Managing Director of OPIC between 2015 and 2019 for questioning over allegations of financial infractions. The Committee Chairman, Musefiu Lamidi, confronted Odusolu with the allegation that some projects carried out by the corporation were without budgetary provisions. Lamidi also alleged that funds expended on MITROS residences in Abeokuta, built by the Amosun administration, were not appropriated for in line with best budgeting practices. In his defence, Odusolu said OPIC started from the stage where it hardly made profit in 2013 when he took over, till it broke even as a profit-oriented corporation in 2019. The former OPIC boss, who was accompanied by some management staff of the corporation, reeled out the various housing projects carried out by the corporation under his purview. While admitting that the corporation spent some funds not budgeted for, he however, explained that the expenditures were approved by the authorities to carry out projects and investments. Odusolu disclosed that OPIC spent over N3.9bn in the provision of 28 housing units at the MTR Gardens Estate in Isheri, which shares boundary with Lagos State. Copyright PUNCH.
