John Alechenu, Abuja A pan-Yoruba socio-cultural association, the Yoruba Summit Group, has declared support for the demand for a referendum made by the Arewa Consultative Forum on the future of Nigeria’s corporate existence. The Secretary-General of the ACF, Murtala Aliyu, had in a media interview made a case for a referendum to determine the terms of Nigeria’s continued existence. He said the north was not afraid of restructuring but would prefer a referendum. The YSG, in a communique issued at the end of a meeting, in Lagos, on Wednesday expressed support for the position canvassed by the ACF and other groups who share the similar views. The communique which was signed by Mogaji Gboyega, reads partly, “The YSG aligns with the position of the ACF and other bodies and groups calling for a Referendum, ’a safely internationally conducted plebiscite to be carried out in all the 6 zones by the people who constitute these component parts whether they so wish to remain together or go their separate ways as it was done in both the Northern and Southern Cameroons on the 11th of February 1961.” According to the communique, the YSG reiterated that its repeated calls for restructuring was based on its belief that it is the panacea for the avoidance of “chaos, anarchy and tyranny.” The group noted that properly trained and equipped state police officers would have been better positioned to stop the senseless loss of lives and property which followed the hijack of the peaceful #EndSARS protests by miscreants.
