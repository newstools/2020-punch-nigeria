Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Nigerian Postal Service has inaugurated an Address Verification Service. Through the service, corporate and private organisations can approach NIPOST to verify addresses given by customers or employees. Post-Master General of the Federation, Ismail Adewusi, disclosed this in Abuja on Thursday during a virtual colloquium to mark 2020 World Post Day ceremony. He said NIPOST was working hand-in-hand with the National Identity Management Commission to deliver the service. Adewusi said, “We have the vision of making post offices a one stop shop whereby people can access several government services through our e-governance service.” He noted that NIPOST was rendering social service to Nigerians in the area of logistics transfer as well as deepening financial inclusion which, according to him, was very low across the country. Adewusi said NIPOST would leave no stone unturned in making its over 1,000 outlets across the country functional in the area of providing e-governance services. “Digital substitution of traditional postal services is accelerating as both consumers and businesses adopt changes in digital processes across multiple domains,” he said. The NIPOST boss added that the agency realised that the postal service needed to be modernised to accommodate the digital age. Copyright PUNCH.
