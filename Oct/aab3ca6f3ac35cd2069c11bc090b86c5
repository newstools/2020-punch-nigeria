Ebenezer Bajela The Algeria Football Federation has announced that their upcoming international friendly with Nigeria will be played behind closed doors. FAF confirmed this in a statement published on their official website on Saturday. The Super Eagles are set to face the Desert Foxes at the Jacques Lemans Arena in Austria October 9. Despite the Austrian government giving room for a maximum 10,000 fans to watch matches in the country as they try to relax COVID-19 restrictions, the Algerian federation says no fan will be allowed into the match venue. “Due to the many requests it has received on this subject, the Algerian Football Federation (FAF) regrets to inform the general public, in particular the supporters of the Greens established in Europe, that the two matches Algeria – Nigeria (October 9) and Algeria – Mexico (October 13) will take place without the presence of the public (behind closed doors),” the statement read.
