Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt There was tension in Rivers State on Thursday as some hoodlums reportedly attacked and killed a policeman in the Oyigbo Local Government Area of the state. The slain police officer, whose identity had yet to be ascertained, was attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad headquarters in Port Harcourt. It was gathered that the incident happened on Wednesday around 9.30pm after the victim, who was on duty, took permission from his superior officer to buy food. His corpse was reportedly dumped on a bush path. A source alleged that the assailants were members of the Indigenous People of Biafra who came from Abia State through a border community. The source said, “Some IPOB members killed a policeman and dumped the body in the bush; it was someone passing that saw the body and reported to the police. They must have come in from Abia State.” The Rivers State Police Public Relations Officer, Nnamdi Omoni, confirmed the incident, adding that details of the attack were still sketchy. Omoni, however, added that the state Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mukan, had ordered a manhunt for the assailants. Copyright PUNCH.
