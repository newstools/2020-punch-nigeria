Toni Ufoh Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, says the ban on sports in the country will be lifted soon, The PUNCH reports. The coronavirus outbreak halted sporting events in Nigeria since March, but in August, the Federal Government lifted restrictions on non-contact sports, with the ban on contact sports not lifted. “We are hopeful that the re-opening of all sports will be shortly upon us,” Dare tweeted on Wednesday. “The ministry has done all that’s necessary and required especially with regard to the COVID-19 protocols. The PTF, Health Ministry and NCDC have guided appropriately. A bit of patience, sports lovers.” Meanwhile, former Super Eagles winger Tijani Babangida has urged the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to lift the ban on contact sports in the country. Babangida said, “I am appealing to the PTF to allow sports especially football and other contact sports to resume because in Europe and in other parts of the world, sporting activities have been allowed to resume, why should Nigeria’s case be different he asked? “Even if the sports come back without fans, it’s good but at least, they should lift the ban on sporting activities like other parts of the world have done. “It is not good that while leagues in Europe and other parts of the world are back, even though it is without fans, NPFL and other sports are still under ban. PTF should please allow these sports to come back too.” Copyright PUNCH.
