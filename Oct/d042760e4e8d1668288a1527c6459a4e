John Charles, Makurdi Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Wednesday assured a former Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, of forgiveness if he tenders an apology. Ortom stated this while speaking to journalists during the distribution of 46 vehicles to the 23 local government chairmen and leaders of the state House of Assembly in Makurdi. The PUNCH had reported on Wednesday that Oshiomhole, at the further hearing of the N10bn libel suit Ortom instituted against him at the state High Court in Makurdi on Tuesday, sought out-of-court settlement. Ortom had slammed the suit on Oshiomhole after he, as APC chairman, accused the governor of having a hand in the death of two Catholic priests and other parishioners at Mbalom community, Gwer East Local Government Area of Benue State on the grounds that one of the priests preached a ‘very critical sermon’ against him (Ortom)’. The presiding judge, Justice Augustine Ityonyiman, had adjourned the case till October 29, 2020, for the report of settlement. Responding to the development, Ortom said, “I am a Christian and the Bible says forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. “So, if your brother offends you and comes back to apologise, you will forgive. Moreover the conditions are there, and I know that I was innocent even when he made all those allegations. “If he comes back now to tender an apology to me and also go back to the same news medium that he used to scandalise and vilify me to have the apology published and also meet the condition set by my lawyers, I will certainly forgive him.” Copyright PUNCH.
