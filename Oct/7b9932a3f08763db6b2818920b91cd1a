Sodiq Oyeleke Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has assured people of the state that he would ensure that his re-election brings growth to the state. Akeredolu was quoted as saying this at his Owo country home residence after he was declared the winner of Saturday’s governorship election by the Independent National Electoral Commission. He said, “We have noted the few dissenting voices of protest in this referendum. We heard them loud and clear. We intend to address genuine grievances. We shall continue to focus on the development of our God-given space, the Sunshine State. “This Administration will not be distracted in the discharge of our sacred mandate. The people will continue to be at the centre of all decisions. “Our state has no business with poverty. Sincere, purposeful, and focused leadership should have little difficulty in harnessing the vast resources, both human and natural. We will put in everything to justify the trust reposed in us.” The PUNCH reports that INEC declared Akeredolu winner of the election after defeating his closest rival and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Eyitayo Jegede, in 12 of the 18 Local Government Areas where the election held. Akeredolu polled 292,830 votes as against Jegede’s 195,791 votes. INEC’s Returning Officer, Prof. Idowu Olayinka, who declared Akeredolu winner, said he had met all conditions required to be returned as governor-elect for the state. Though Jegede won the first LG (Ifedore) result to be announced, Akeredolu maintained a comfortable lead after 16 of the 18 LGAs’ results were announced. Jegede won in Akure South, Akure North, and Ifedore LGAs while the Deputy Governor and Zenith Labour Party candidate, Agboola Ajayi, won none.
