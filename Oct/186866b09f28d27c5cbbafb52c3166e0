Human rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong, has written a letter to the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, demanding the CCTV footage of the shootings at the Lekki toll plaza on October 20, 2020. In the letter, titled, ‘Urgent Request Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 2011’, the lawyer promised to undertake and pay the cost of certification and any applicable administrative fees. It read in part, “I am a Nigerian citizen, resident of Lagos State, human rights activist, private legal practitioner and lawful participant in the #EndSARS movement cum peaceful protest. “As an interested party and pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 2011, I hereby respectfully apply for the authenticated copies of the Closed Circuit Television records showing the attack on the #EndSARS protesters at the Lekki tollgate in Lagos on October 20, 2020.” Effiong also requested certified copies of the instrument setting up the judicial panel of inquiry and restitution for victims of SARS related abuses and the Lekki toll gate incident with its terms of reference. The activist said he urgently required the CCTV records and the instrument establishing the panel of inquiry as this would enable him to participate and properly represent victims at the panel.
