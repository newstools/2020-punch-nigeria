Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia Abia State Government has appealed to suspected hoodlums who looted the medical equipment at the Abia State Dental Center, Aba, and Primary Health Authority office in Aba South Local Government Area to return them within seven days. A statement by the Commissioner for Information in the state, Chief John Okiyi-Kalu, stated that the hoodlums who hijacked the otherwise peaceful #EndSARS protests took away vaccines, X-ray machines, sterilizers, air conditioners, fans, and other equipment as well as disposables and consumables carted away. The statement directed the looters to return the stolen items to the office of the Special Adviser to the Governor on Health Matters, Mr Joe Chinwendu, with information on the location of the items. The statement read, “Kindly note that most of the Primary Health Care and Dental equipment are trackable and will certainly be recovered in due course if not voluntarily returned. “Members of the public are hereby warned not to buy or use any of the stolen items or procure such items from unauthorised persons to avoid getting into trouble with the law”.
