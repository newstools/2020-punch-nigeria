Femi Makinde, Abiodun Nejo Former Deputy Governor of Ekiti State, Chief Abiodun Aluko, on Thursday urged the people of Ondo State to shun violence and any attempt to manipulate Saturday’s governorship election. Aluko, who is a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, made the plea in a telephone interview with The PUNCH. He said “It is unfortunate that some miscreants and thugs have decided to cause violence and give APC, the ruling party, a bad name. “Let everybody go out and vote according to his conscience on Saturday. The Ondo electorate should be mindful of the fact that immediately the votes are counted, the result goes straight to the Independent National Electoral Commission portal, so, there is no room for manipulation. “Going by what INEC did in Edo State which they had promised to improve upon. Let’s give INEC benefit of doubt and another opportunity to prove its worth, but I am sure Ondo election will be free, credible and transparent.” Copyright PUNCH.
