Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday restored the registration of the Youth Party of Nigeria, which was among the over 70 political parties de-registered by the Independent National Electoral Commission in February. In his judgment on the suit instituted by the YPN, Justice Inyang Ekwo reversed the deregistration of the party on the grounds that it was done in breach of the party’s right to fair hearing. While the judge affirmed that INEC was empowered under Section 255(a) of the Nigerian Constitution to deregister political parties, he ruled that the commission must exercise the power as stipulated by the law. The judge added that the deregistration was carried out in violation of the pending court proceedings initiated by the party. He noted that despite the fact that the party had filed its suit to avert the deregistration in January 2020, INEC went ahead to deregister it on February 6, 2020, ignoring the proceedings pending in court. The judge, who ruled that the deregistration was arbitrary, added, “I condemn the action of the defendant in de-registering the plaintiff while its case was pending.” The judge issued an order restraining INEC from going ahead to deregister the party until given equal opportunity to participate in the 2023 general elections.
