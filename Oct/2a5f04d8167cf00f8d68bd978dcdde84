The Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, on Monday, appealed to the people of the state not to be deceived by the opposition parties candidates. He explained that “the election coming on Saturday is between a statesman and the politicians”. Akeredolu claimed that some of the people who want him out of power once advised him to learn how to tell lies to the people because of his second term ambition. Speaking on Monday when he played host to a group of young professionals under the aegis of Young Ondo Professionals Foundation, Akeredolu promised to consistently govern the people of the state with the fear of God. The All Progressives Congress candidate said, “I have governed this state like a statesman, not as a politician. I have conducted myself with the fear of God. I have refused to be allowed to be railroaded into the infamy of political sloganeering. I want to return to office to build young leaders and wage war against poverty. “One of my major offenses today is that I am too honest, truthful, and straightforward. I have been told that being straightforward, honest, sincere, and open-minded to the people whom I swore to honestly lead is an aberration in the firmament of politics. “When I leave the government, I want to live among the people. I want to retire to Owo, as a statesman because I have governed the people like a statesman. The election coming on Saturday is between a statesman and the politicians. I leave you to choose wisely.”
