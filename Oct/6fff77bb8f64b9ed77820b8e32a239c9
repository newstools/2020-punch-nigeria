Sodiq Oyeleke The Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has faulted the declaration of curfew in the state. The spokesman for the Lagos PDP, Gani Taofeeq, in a statement on Tuesday, warned that curfew will trigger more protests in the state. The statement was titled, ‘Curfew declaration: confrontational, ill-advised’. Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, earlier announced a 24-hour curfew in the state to curb violence arising from protests against police brutality and bad governance in the country. The statement noted that “the PDP opines that the decision is confrontational, ill-advised and capable of inflaming the already compressed ‘beast’ in the peaceful demonstrators against Police brutality and other government induced vices in the state. “The governor must consequently take responsibility for any degeneration into maiming, killing, and oppressive arrest. “The governor has again showed that “he acts copy and paste in governance, otherwise, the peculiarities of ancillary issues of agitations in the state are such that the governor only needs to act immediately rather than declaring curfew apparently because one or two governors did same.” “The governor should simply have gone ahead to announce welfare supports for the Police command officers; declare the account of the LSSTF; stop toll collections in the state; announce at least 50 per cent tuition fees reduction in all state government schools; scrap or reduce by at least 50 per cent charges of Alpha Beta; discount by at least 40 per cent Lagos housing; reduce by at least 50 per cent cost of all state-owned transportation within the state; reduction of his emoluments and that of the House members to mention a few. “if governor Sanwo-Olu does these in 48 hours, these protesters will calm down.”
