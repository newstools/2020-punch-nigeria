Sunday Aborisade and Adelani Adepegba SEVENTEEN senators from the South-West geopolitical zone rose from a meeting on Thursday and condemned the wanton destruction in the regions by some protesters. The lawmakers in a communique signed by all of them, however, said they recognised the right of citizens to ventilate their grievances by way of peaceful protests, but lamented the violent incidents in some places in the South-West region. The senators also condemned the use of force to disperse peaceful protesters. The South-West caucus in the Senate said it had received the five-point demands of the #EndSARS protesters as a team and had passed them on to their Federal Government for immediate action. Part of the communique read, “With our colleagues in the House of Representatives, we have passed these demands to the Federal Executive for implementation. “We deprecate unequivocally the use of brute force against peaceful protesters in the country. “In view of the massive infrastructure deficit and precarious financial situation of the country, we condemn wanton destruction of public property and those of private individuals by hoodlums as this constitutes bastardisation of the cause of genuine #EndSARS peaceful protesters.” Copyright PUNCH.
