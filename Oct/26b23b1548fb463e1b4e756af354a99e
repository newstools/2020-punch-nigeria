Chima Azubuike, Gombe No fewer than 6,000 units out of 20,000 meters ordered were on Monday received by Jos Electricity Distribution Company Plc to be installed in its franchise area of operations between now and December. The meters according to the Managing Director, Mr Hashim Bakori, cost the company a total of N1.45bn. Bakori said the 6,000 meters would be deployed only to customers who had previously keyed into the company’s promo of debt recovery that took place in 2019. He explained that the meters would be targeted at unmetered customers on Band A and B to avoid probable disputes that could arise if they were left on estimations. Bakori said, “We will give these meters to our customers who were promised during the promo exercise as a measure of the fulfilment of our promises to them. “Some of them keyed into our debt recovery promo and so, we are morally obligated to give them the meters.” He said the meters were not only for retail customers but also for high tension metered customers for energy accounting and for unmanned injection sub stations energy data analysis.
