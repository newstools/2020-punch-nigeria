Samson Folarin No fewer than 2,000 residents of Lagos have been reportedly empowered by the Lagos State Government. Each of the indigent residents were said to have received products valued at N10,000, as part of efforts to lift them out of poverty. According to a statement on Wednesday, the empowerment scheme, which is in its second edition, is tagged, ‘Eko Care: Go forward, Grow Lagos’. The Special Adviser, Office of Civic Engagement, Aderemi Adebowale, said it was a social intervention programme designed to serve as a palliative measure for the vulnerable, less privileged, lower echelon of the Lagos society. “The initiative aims to create a platform for financial empowerment of the poorest of the poor in the state thus enhancing socio-economic inclusion and cohesion,” Adebowale added. She explained that the beneficiaries were selected across the 20 local government and 37 local council development areas of the state. Adebowale advised the beneficiaries to see the empowerment as an opportunity to lift them out of the woods, adding that her office would continue to monitor and engage them individually and collectively to ensure they grew in their business.
