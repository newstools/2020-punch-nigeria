Joseph Olaoluwa The Lagos State Waterways Authority on Thursday commenced the annual exercise of clearing and removing water hyacinth across jetties, terminals, and routes on the state inland waterways. General Manager of LASWA, Oluwadamilola Emmanuel, in a statement said that clearing of the water hyacinth had commenced simultaneously at three different locations – Ikorodu, Badore, Badagry. The statement titled ‘LASWA commence clearing of hyacinth in the waterways’, said the exercise would be extended to other zones in due time. He was quoted to have said, “The governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has graciously approved the clearing of all impediment to smooth navigation including the water hyacinth (a highly problematic invasive species) obstructing the free flow of traffic on the state inland waterways. “Therefore, the agency has mobilised the required labour force and machinery to the project sites to commence immediately.” Emmanuel explained that the first phase of the project involved pegging down the water hyacinth to curtail its movement and infestation across ferry channels, followed by an eventual clearing of the aquatic weed using both manual labour and weed harvesting machines.
