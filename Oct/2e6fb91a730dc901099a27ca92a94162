Dayo Ojerinde The President of the Rotary Club of Ikeja, Mr Oludotun Lampejo, has urged youths to invest their time and resources in technology. He explained that the youth needed to show more interest in developing applications at an early age in order to contribute to social development. A statement said Lampejo spoke on Sunday during his virtual installation as the 53rd president of the club. He said, “Our star project is always under basic education and literacy. We want to encourage the students at an early age because no country can exist without the development of technology and we have very smart children who are interested in technology. We want them to channel all their knowledge in developing apps and doing good in society, rather than the wire fraud youths are getting accustomed to these days.” The immediate past president, Mr Muyiwa Fagbola, said that the club was voted the second-best club in Rotary District 9110 during his tenure.
