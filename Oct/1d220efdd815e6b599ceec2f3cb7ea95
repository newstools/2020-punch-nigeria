Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja The Lagos State Police Command has released an unemployed man, Solomon Okon, who allegedly tried to commit suicide in August, 2020. The PUNCH had reported that Okon, who earned N35,000 a month as a porter at Havana Hospital, Surulere, Lagos, allegedly drank a poisonous substance after receiving a letter terminating his employment. After being treated, Okon was handed over to the police and was arraigned before a Magistrate Court in Yaba. The magistrate granted the 21-year-old Okon bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties. He, however, remained in police custody for nearly two months for being unable to meet bail conditions. A relative to Okon, however, reached out to this newspaper, lamenting that the defendant would not be able to meet the bail conditions, adding that it was immoral for the police to arraign an unemployed man for attempted suicide and a fine of N200,000 imposed on him. After The PUNCH publication, however, four Non-Governmental Organisations intervened and helped Okon to process his bail. Speaking with our correspondent on Thursday, a cousin of the defendant, Richard Ekanem, thanked The PUNCH for the publicity given to the report.
