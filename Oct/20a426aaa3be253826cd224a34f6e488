Ebenezer Bajela Striker Victor Osimhen will look to open his Serie A goal account when Napoli face champions Juventus on match-day three at the Allianz Stadium on Sunday. Osimhen has played a total of 119 minutes from two matches for the Partenopei but is yet to score. The 20-year-old scored an impressive 18 goals for Lille last season before his record transfer move to Italy. Meanwhile, former Napoli defender, Ruud Krol, has backed the Nigeria international to hit the ground running for the table toppers once he fits well into the team. “Genoa and Parma are certainly not at the level of Juve, the Bianconeri have as much quality as Napoli, it will be an open match, both teams can score goals,” Krol said on Radio Kiss Kiss. “Osimhen hasn’t scored yet, He has other qualities too. He has a lot of movement, it’s always difficult for a striker to fit in right away, and we saw that with Lozano.” Napoli currently top the summit with six points from two matches. Copyright PUNCH.
