Samson Folarin Suspected hoodlums on Thursday broke into a warehouse used for the storage of COVID-19 palliatives in Mazamaza community, in the Amuwo Odofin Local Government Area of Lagos State. The group was said to have looted foodstuffs in the warehouse, located on Benster Crescent, aka Monkey Village. Clips of the attack posted on Twitter revealed thousands of residents trooping into the warehouse to carry bags of rice, garri, beans, noodles, among others. A military truck was also seen being loaded with the palliatives. However, the state acting Commissioner for Agriculture, Abisola Olusanya, condemned the looting of the warehouse, saying the foodstuffs were donated to the government by the private sector-led Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID). She explained that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on September 22, 2020, formally took the food palliatives from the CACOVID team for distribution to indigent residents. “The government notes that the warehouse in question is not state-owned and its usage was made available to the CACOVID group. The state government was allowed to commence re-bagging of food items allotted to it from the quantities meant for South-West states. “The re-bagging was being done to account for each beneficiary receipt as was required and monitored by the CACOVID team. “The distribution was ongoing, but was halted due to protests, before the invasion of the warehouse today (Thursday),” she added.
