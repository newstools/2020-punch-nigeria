Friday Olokor, Enyioha Opara Again, the National Examinations Council has announced the rescheduling of the papers meant for Thursday, Friday and Saturday, attributing it to circumstances beyond its control. This will be the second time NECO would be rescheduling the examination this week, the first being on Sunday. The organisation said the affected papers would now be scheduled for November 17, 18 and 2020, while the time table for the papers would soon be made available. The Head, Information and Public Relations Division, NECO, Azeez Sani,  made the announcement in a statement on Wednesday. He said, “This is to inform the general public and especially candidates that NECO has been constrained by circumstances beyond its control,  to reschedule the papers meant for Thursday 22 October 2020, Friday 23 October 2020 and Saturday 24 October 2020. “The affected papers are now scheduled for  November 17, 18 and 19 2020. The examination time table for these papers will be made available subsequently. These changes were due to the security challenges, which led to the imposition of curfew and closure of schools by some state governments in order to safeguard lives and  properties. In the circumstances, it has become difficult for the council to move examination materials across the country. “The council prays that the examinations will continue on Tuesday 27 October 2020, all things being equal, with the papers as originally scheduled in the examination time table. Any inconvenience caused is highly regretted.” Copyright PUNCH.
