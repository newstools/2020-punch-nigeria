John Alechenu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has given 10 reasons why it believes the Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu deserves a second term in office. The party said its candidate has within the last three and half years demonstrated competence especially in the area of managing scarce resources to deliver services which impacted positively on the lives of most residents of the state. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘Governorship: 10 Reasons Rotimi Akeredolu Deserves a Second Term – APC…Urge Security Services to Protect Voters from PDP, ZLP Violence Threats,’ signed by the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, in Abuja, on Thursday. Nabena said, “Akeredolu who is the governorship candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress is running for a second term buoyed by his administration’s first-term unparalleled and multi-sector achievements, cross-partisan support and widespread acceptance by the good people of the Sunshine state.” The Peoples Democratic Party, however, insists that the people of Ondo State were tired of both the APC and its candidate, Rotimi Akeredolu. In a telephone interview with our correspondent in Abuja, the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan said, “It is clear for all to see; the people are simply tired of Akeredolu’s directionless administration and have resolved to vote him out on Saturday. Nigerians, especially the good people of Ondo State, have seen through the deceit and propaganda of the APC.”
