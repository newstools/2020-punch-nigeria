Friday Olokor, Abuja The internal crisis that has taken its toll on the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees worsened on Sunday with its National Caretaker Committee declaring the appointment of Ahmed Labbo as illegal. The NCTC also described the appointment as a rape on the constitution of the NULGE and an affront on the rule of law. Labbo was reportedly appointed the National President of NULGE, following the death of Alhaji Ibrahim Khaleel. But the NCTC described Labbo’s appointment as “an improper way to honour and immortalise Khaleel, the initiator of the peace process.” Khaleel was said to have died on October 7, few hours after one of their reconciliatory meetings with the IG team, where both parties agreed to submit, the following week, their different templates for a peaceful resolution of the crisis. The sudden death of Khaleel in circumstances that are still unclear and at a time when NULGE was in serious crisis was said to have sent fears among its top echelon. Copyright PUNCH.
