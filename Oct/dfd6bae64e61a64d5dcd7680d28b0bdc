Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State House of Assembly on Thursday condemned the planned attack on the state government establishments by hoodlums who have been on rampage after hijacking the #EndSARS protest. A Statement signed by the Speaker of the state assembly, Marcus Onobun, condemned the violence introduced into the otherwise peaceful protests. The statement read in part, “The attention of the Edo State House of Assembly has been drawn to a criminally inciting voice note that is being circulated in the social media which speaks of plans to burn down all public establishments in Edo state. “While this would ordinarily have been considered a mere threat, it however aligns with the worrisome pattern of destructive activities perpetrated by hoodlums who have since hijacked the well – intentioned peaceful #EendSARS protests by youths across Nigeria. “The House wishes to reiterate its support for the rights of citizens to freedom of speech, expression and peaceful assembly. But, as an arm of government, we have a constitutional responsibility to ensure the full protection of lives and livelihoods of Edo people. “The involvement of certain political tendencies in this dastardly and cowardly efforts at destabilizing the state must be resisted. The destruction of public and private property anywhere in Edo State only serves the interest of enemies of the State and brings untold hardship to our people. This must be roundly condemned and resisted by Edo people.” “The lawmakers urged security agents to rise to the occasion by stopping the plot by criminally minded groups to wreak havoc on the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
