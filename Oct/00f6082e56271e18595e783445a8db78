Oladimeji Ramon Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo to emulate the good example of the Deputy Governor of Kebbi State, Mr Yombe Dabai Samaila, who reportedly made available his asset declaration form. In a statement on Sunday, SERAP’s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oludare, said in response to a lawsuit filed by the organisation, Samaila, last week, forwarded his asset declaration form to SERAP. “The form, dated 28 May, 2019, and sworn to before the High Court of Justice, Bikebbi, Kebbi State, shows that Mr Samaila declared assets, including landed property and cash in banks, valued at N353,136,378.56, from which he stated that he receives N61,500,000.00 yearly as income,” Oludare said. He said SERAP welcomed Samaila’s demonstrated commitment to transparency and accountability, and urged Buhari and Osinbajo to emulate him. SERAP said it was impressed by Samaila’s action “especially at a time when many government officials and institutions continue to exhibit blatant disregard for Freedom of Information requests by refusing to even acknowledge several of such requests.” READ ALSO: I caught my estranged wife in bed with a married man – Fani-Kayode It said, “President Buhari and Vice-President Osinbajo should show leadership by immediately widely publishing their asset declaration forms, just as Mr Samaila has rightly done.
