Ife Ogunfuwa The Standards Organisation of Nigeria is advocating for the use of standards in the technical processes in order to prevent the  degradation of the environment. In a statement to commemorate the World Standards Day, the SON noted that international standards prepared by International Electrotechnical Commission, International Organisation for Standardisation  and International Telecommunications Union take into account tried and true solutions to technical challenges. The Director General,  SON, Mallam Farouk Salim, said the focus of the 2020 celebration being coordinated by the IEC , ISO and the  ITU was ‘Protecting the planet with standards’. Salim posited that rapid population growth and broad urbanisation called for the responsible use of limited resources. The international organisations, according to him,  help to share expertise and expert know-how broadly, within developed and developing countries alike. He stated that standards cover all aspects of energy savings, water and air quality, while laying down standardised protocols and methods of measurement. According to Salim, their broad use helps reduce the environmental impact of industrial production and processes, facilitates the reuse of limited resources and improves energy efficiency. The SON DG affirmed that his organisation as a representative of the international standardisation bodies would continue to propagate the global standards through adoption and modification for local use, manpower training through seminars, workshops, consumer enlightenment activities and certification of products, processes and systems using international standards.
