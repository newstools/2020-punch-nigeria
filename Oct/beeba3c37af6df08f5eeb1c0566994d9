Ada Wodu, Calabar The Cross-River State Hausa community has promised the Ohanaeze Ndigbo that it would support the South-East in its quest for the emergence of an Igbo President in 2023. Paramount leader of the Hausa and Fulani communities in the state, Alhaji Salisu Abba Lawan said while playing host to a delegation of members of Ohaneze Ndigbo in his palace at Bogobiri area of Calabar. Lawan said “Let me thank the Ohaneze Ndigbo for coming to strengthen the bone of friendship between Hausa and Fulani communities and the Igbo brothers living in the state. “We cannot claim to have a country that belongs to all of us while leaving a major component out of the leadership of this country.  I am assuring you that Hausa and Fulani communities in the state would be educated on why an Igbo should be allowed to be President of the country in 2023.” Earlier, the President of the state chapter of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Ugorji Nwabueze who led the Igbo delegation said the request by the South East to be given a chance was in the interest of justice noting that all Nigerians stood to benefit from an Igbo presidency.
