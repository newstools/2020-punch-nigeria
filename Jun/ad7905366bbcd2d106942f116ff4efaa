Matthew Ochei, Asaba THE people of Ovwor-Olomu and Effurun-Otor communities in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State have commended the Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as the historic bridge linking both communities was completed by the state government. It was gathered that the project, whose contract was first awarded 39 years ago, was abandoned by previous administrations in the state until Okowa came into office and awarded the project. The bridge, which is 100 meters long with 20 meters span, has a height of 45 meters from the water level and three 300 meters asphalt road and side drains on both sides of the approach. Inspecting the project on Wednesday, the Commissioner for Works, Chief James Augoye, said that the project had opened up the economic landscape of both communities, and that investors were now free to invest in the area without hindrances.
