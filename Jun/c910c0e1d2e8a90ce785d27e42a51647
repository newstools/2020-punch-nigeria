Peter David, Benin The Adamawa State Governor, Umaru Fintiri, has said Edo State is technically a Peoples Democratic Party state. Fintiri stated this in Benin during the party’s ward congress to elect ad-hoc delegates for the governorship primary. The governor said, “I want to say without mincing word, technically, Edo is a PDP state because, in the previous election, you can see our performance, we did very well, we won the presidential election here in Edo, we won two out of three senatorial seats in Edo, four or five of House of Representatives in Edo. “So, technically, Edo is a PDP state. I will continue to give a pass mark to those that are holding the structure of this party.” Fintiri urged the delegates to vote wisely in the forthcoming governorship election in the state.
