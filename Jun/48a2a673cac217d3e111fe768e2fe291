Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, on Thursday denied a report that he and his supporters were jubilating over the Appeal Court’s verdict affirming the suspension of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Mr Adams Oshiomhole. The governor, who spoke through the state Commissioner for Information, Mr Donald Ojogo, described a report that he welcomed the plight of Oshiomhole as untrue and mischievous. The governor said he could not be happy if the party was engulfed in a crisis let alone jubilating over the judgment against the national chairman of the party. He said, “The level of concern may vary but as leaders and members of APC in Ondo State, we were greatly concerned not because of any personal reason but because we felt that the party didn’t need whatever intrigues that may shake the table at this point in time. “So, like every other member of the party nationwide, we were all concerned. Mr Governor is the leader of the party and as such, he will be so much disturbed if there are crises in the party.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
