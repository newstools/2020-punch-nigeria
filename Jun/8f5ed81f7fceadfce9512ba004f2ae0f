Johnny Edward Fortuna Dusseldorf goalkeeper Maduka Okoye is delighted that Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has extended his deal with the Nigeria Football Federation. The NFF and Rohr last week agreed to a new two-year contract extension that will see the German finish as the longest-serving coach in Super Eagles history by the end of his tenure in 2022. “I’m very happy with Rohr’s two-year contract extension. He’s a great coach and I think everybody feels very comfortable with him as a coach. He talks a lot to us players and always cares. With him as a coach we can achieve a lot of things in the near future,” Okoye told The PUNCH. The 20-year-old also cast fresh doubts over his future at his German club, admitting that a move to Dutch topflight side Sparta Rotterdam is imminent. Okoye’s current contract with Fortuna Dusseldorf expires at the end of June and he disclosed that he has held talks with Sparta over a move in the summer. “Yes. It’s true, we are in talks with Sparta Rotterdam. It’s a good club with a lot of history. Great stadium and even greater fans, this could be the next and a good step for me,” Okoye told The PUNCH.
