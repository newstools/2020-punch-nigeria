I will miss the bank and the excellent team we have built. I will continue to strongly support the bank from wherever I am. “I thank President Akinwumi Adesina for his strong leadership, guidance and support which have undoubtedly motivated and helped my team and I to play a key role in the transformation of the bank. I feel privileged to have been given an opportunity to contribute to the bank’s agenda for accelerating Africa’s social and economic transformation.” The President, AfDB, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, said he had been delighted to work with Blanke over the past three and a half years. “She has demonstrated genuine leadership skills and moved the needles on so many fronts, especially in the areas of food security, women’s financial empowerment and job creations. I wish her all the best and look forward to continued partnerships and engagement with Jennifer,” he added.
