Aruna Quadri has been included by the International Table Tennis Federation as one of their ambassadors for the global campaign against COVID-19. Former world No.1 Germany’s Timo Boll and three-time world champion Ding Ning of China are expected to lead the campaign. A statement by the Nigeria Table Tennis Federation on Sunday, which was made available to our correspondent, said the campaign, tagged #TableTennisUnited, was aimed at raising funds to support the athletes, coaches, umpires, national associations and field projects, who are all in need of a helping hand in the difficult times necessitated by COVID-19. “#TableTennisUnited is a show of defiant solidarity in the face of a COVID-19 enforced shutdown of the sport and any donations that you can spare will be hugely appreciated by the whole table tennis family,” NTTF stated. “The ambassadors are expected to record special messages to call for support for the fundraiser campaign while holding on to the ball, before passing the ball on to the next person.” More than $250,000 is expected to be raised in the cause of the campaign powered by the ITTF Foundation and supported by ITTF and World Table Tennis.
