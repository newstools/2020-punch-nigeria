Peter Dada Akure Some youths suspected to be political thugs allegedly invaded a meeting venue of a group of supporters of the Ondo State governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, in his hometown, Owo the headquarters of Owo Local Government Area of the state, on Sunday evening. The hoodlums were said to have injured some All Progressives Congress members at the venue of the meeting, held in the Igboroko area of the town. They also allegedly vandalised a bus with the inscription–‘Akeredolu for second term’. According to an eyewitness, when the thugs got to the area where the meeting was being held, they started shooting sporadically to announce their presence. Many of the governor’s supporters at the meeting were allegedly hit by stray bullets. The leader of the supporters, Mr Olayemi Olamide, accused an APC governorship aspirant from Owo town of sponsoring the attack. He said, “We were holding our meeting as a group to declare our total support for the re-election of Governor Akeredolu when these thugs brandishing sophisticated weapons such as guns, axes and cutlasses arrived in two vans and a white pick-up. “The thugs fired gunshots sporadically in the open and destroyed Aketi’s campaign bus parked on the side of the street. The attack lasted for about an hour. Some of our people were hit by stray bullets fired by the thugs.” When contacted on Monday, the Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, said, “We can confirm that the incident happened. When our men got to the scene, there were sporadic gunshots, so they had to retreat and nobody has been arrested yet. We have started investigation into the matter.” Copyright PUNCH.
