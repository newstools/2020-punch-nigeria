Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The management of Kakanfo Inn and Conference Centre, Ibadan, has distributed some foodstuffs to indigent residents of Oke-Are communities in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The foodstuffs, including garri, rice and catfish, were said to have been donated as palliative materials to cushion the effect of the partial lockdown order by the state government in view of the COVID-19 scourge. The food items were packed on Monday in five kilogrammes each. The Operations Manager of the hotel, Oreoluwa Esan, urged the residents to cooperate with the government by complying with the social distancing order and adherence to hygienic practices. She said, “Kakanfo Inn and Conference Centre feels persuaded to reach out to the community considering the realities of the moment. This is the third time we are reaching out to members of the public. “The company’s intention was to give back to artisans and those who are struggling with survival during the period of the lockdown. The second one was done on the 19th of May. Our intention was to cover the entire Ibadan South East and the North East.”Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
