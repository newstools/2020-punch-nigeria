Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri A 55-year-old man, Patrick Uchenwoke, has been murdered on his way home from a church service in Imo State. The incident, which occurred in Orodo, Mbaitoli Local Government Area of the state, threw the community into shock. The police spokesperson in the state, Orlando Ikeokwu, who confirmed the incident to our correspondent, added that the state Commissioner of Police, Isaac Akinmoyede, had ordered a thorough investigation into the murder. Ikeokwu said, “On June 21, 2020, around 3.20pm, operatives of the Divisional Police Headquarters, Mbaitoli, acting on a report earlier made to the station, moved to an isolated area around the Ahaba Orodo Community School and found the corpse of one Patrick Uchenwoke, 55, a native of Oboro Amurie in the Isu LGA, but resident at Ahaba Orodo, in a pool of his own blood. “The operatives also discovered that he had a deep machete cut in the back of his head, while a bicycle and a Bible were seen beside the corpse, thus suggesting that he must have been murdered while going or returning from church. “The Commissioner of Police, Imo State, has ordered a full-scale investigation into the matter with a view to arresting the assassins as well as unravelling the reason behind the dastardly act. “Meanwhile, the corpse has been deposited in the morgue and investigation is in progress.” Copyright PUNCH.
