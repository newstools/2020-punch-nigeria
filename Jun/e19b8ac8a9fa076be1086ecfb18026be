Ted Odogwu, Kano The Chairman, Kano State Pension Fund Trustees, Sani Gabasawa, on Thursday said the state government owed retired workers N20bn gratuities. Gabasawa said the pension trustees had not been able to pay gratuities to retirees since 2016, a situation that led to an accumulated  backlog of  N20bn for over 31,000 retirees. He said,  “As I am talking to you, we pay N1.2bn pension to retirees every month. Every month, the pension increases. We are in a difficult situation. Let me tell you that there must be delay in the payment of gratuities in this state. This is because the state has not paid gratuities since 2016, due to lack of funds. “At the moment, we are owed N20bn and government organisations don’t pay their statutory eight per cent to us; they owe us N28bn.” Gabasawa expressed hope that the state government would soon resume the payment of gratuities to the retirees, as the state governor, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, had constituted  a committee to ratify all discrepancies in a bid to continue the disbursement of the retired workers’ entitlements. On the allegation that he engaged in negotiation with retirees to pay certain percentage out of their entitlements before they are paid their gratuities, Gabasawa asked his accusers to produce evidence.
