Toni Ufoh Former Arsenal captain Robin van Persie has hailed Bukayo Saka following his remarkable breakthrough season in North London. The 18-year-old has been a mainstay in Mikel Arteta’s side since the Spaniard replaced his compatriot Unai Emery in December, having also earned opportunities under the former. That has seen Saka widely regarded as Arsenal’s best academy graduate since former captain Cesc Fabregas, with the teenager backed to become a star at the Emirates Stadium. Van Persie believes the winger offers a wide range of talents to his side. “If you point out Saka, I’m a huge fan of his. He can play as a defender, he can play midfield, striker, not the main striker but on the wing,” he told BT Sport. “He’s a multi-talented player who can offer assists, goals, he’s a joy to watch.” Saka has enjoyed a remarkable breakthrough season, netting three goals and contributing 10 assists across 33 appearances in all competitions.
