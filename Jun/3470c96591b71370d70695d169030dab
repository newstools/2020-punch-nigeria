’Tosin Oluwalowo Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, says he doubted striker, Odion Ighalo’s ability to perform for the Reds Devils. Ighalo joined United on a six-month loan deal from Chinese side Shanghai Shenhua in January, scoring four goals in eight appearances for the club. His performance earned him a further six months extension to his loan deal with the EPL club. Speaking with MUTV, Scholes praised the ex-Super Eagles striker for settling in well at the club. “You have to say his (manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer) three or four signings have been excellent,” Scholes said. “I was a little bit dubious about the Ighalo one, I wasn’t quite sure how that would work, but you have to say that’s worked as well. “He’s a different kind of player from the players we had, a bit more of a target man, which we miss, and he seems to have settled in really well, scoring goals.” United will resume their Premier League fixtures with a trip to London to face Tottenham Hotspurs on June 19. The league resumed after three months break due to the coronavirus pandemic. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
