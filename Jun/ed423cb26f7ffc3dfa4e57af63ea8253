TOPE OMOGBOLAGUN Following the report on the 12-year-old girl gang-raped by four masked men at her parent’s residence in Abijo area of Ajah, Lagos State, the Office of the Public Defender has offered to render free service to get justice for the victim. A member of staff of the OPD who reached out to our correspondent on Saturday night stated that the organisation was willing to offer free legal services to the teenager aside from other free offers. The OPD official said, “I am calling in respect of your story on the 12-year-old girl gang-raped at Abijo area of Lagos. We will like to know how our office can reach out through you to the victim’s family for free legal services. “We also do not just want to offer legal services, we want to ensure that due diligence is followed on the case, while we follow up on the police as well as the community leaders to be sure that the case is not swept under the carpet.” Saturday PUNCH had reported that the victim, a secondary school pupil, was left bleeding from injuries she sustained in her private parts after she was raped by four masked men at her residence.
