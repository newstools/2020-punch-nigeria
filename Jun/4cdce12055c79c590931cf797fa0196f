Dayo Ojerinde The Chief Medical Director of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Prof. Adetokunbo Fabamwo, has said the hospital would soon begin testing for COVID-19. Fabamwo, at a briefing, said the institution had the potential to test for COVID-19, adding that it would help to increase the testing capacity in the state. “As we speak, LASUTH has the potential to test for COVID-19. There is a molecular machine in our College of Medicine which can be used to test and we have a gene expert machine that can be adapted to test for COVID-19. “We have been asked by the state to know what is required to make the machine and the gene machine to work and they have been ordered. We are expecting that by freight. LASUTH will become a testing centre and that is what will help in ensuring that our patients get tested very fast and we will be able to add to the testing capability of the test,” Fabamwo said. The CMD, however, said the institution does not treat and admit COVID-19 patients because the hospital layout was of the cottage type. “Our wards are interwoven and so if we close one or two wards to admit COVID-19 patients, we suspect that there may be a risk of cross-infection but we believe that the state government is expanding the capability to admit COVID-19 patients. “We hope it won’t get to a stage where the hospital beds will be required for COVID-19 patients. However, if and when we get to that stage, LASUTH will have no choice but to join,” Fabanwo said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
