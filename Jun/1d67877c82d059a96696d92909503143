Kayode Oyero Femi Adesina, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), says the Peoples Democratic Party plunged Nigeria into a cesspool of backwardness from 1999 to 2015. Adesina said the party does not breathe progress, adding that despite raising billions of naira for its head office, the party has not been able to complete it. In a piece entitled, ‘A Good Setback by 60 Years,’ the President’s spokesman argued that the PDP has a “fixation with 60 years” but could only rule Nigeria for 16 years. He said since the party lost to his principal and the All Progressives Congress in the 2015 elections, the PDP has not stopped fantasying about 60 years.

Adesina listed some of Buhari’s feats in the last five years including those in the Agriculture sector, noting that neighbouring countries now buy food from Nigeria. He wrote, “We used to import everything. Even when we had a celebrated farmer as President, we brought in rice from all over the world, and beans from Burkina Faso. Maize, wheat, sorghum, millet, we imported everything. Fertilizer was one huge scam, when we planted nothing. “Then Buhari came. He told Nigerians to return to the land. And he put his money where his mouth was. Agriculture was massively funded, and today, we have pyramids of rice round the country. We no longer import any type of grains, rather our neighbours come to buy here. We are almost self-sufficient in food.”
