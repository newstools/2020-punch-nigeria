Joseph Olaoluwa MTN Nigeria has provided 3.71 billion free Short Message Services to over 51 million subscribers across the nation. The company disclosed this in a statement made available to our correspondent by its public relations consultant, BHM. According to the statement, the figure means that 75 per cent of all MTN subscribers have now utilised the service introduced in April 2020 to enable subscribers to glide through the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chief Executive Officer of MTN, Ferdi Moolman, expressed delight that several Nigerians had benefitted from the service. He was quoted to have said, “Having entered the third and final month of this, I am hugely encouraged that so many people nationwide have made use of the service. “The three billion-plus text messages sent so far reflects the importance of communication during times like this, especially for the most vulnerable amongst us. “I am grateful to our government and regulators, partners and employees for the roles they have played in making the delivery of this service possible, and encourage our subscribers to continue to make use of it until the end of June.” The initiative was implemented to ensure that MTN’s customers would be able to access loved ones, support systems and information while faced with unprecedented challenges and uncertainties during the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak.
