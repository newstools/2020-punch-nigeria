John Alechenu, Abuja The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has written to the Independent National Electoral Commission insisting that the party has chosen the direct primary mode for the selection of its candidate for the Edo State governorship poll. In a letter dated May 19, 2020, addressed to INEC Chairman, Oshiomhole said the party had put in place measures to ensure strict compliance with the COVID-19 prevention guidelines. An acknowledged copy of the letter sighted by our correspondent in Abuja, on Wednesday, said the party’s decision was in full compliance with the APC constitution and the Electoral Act. The letter captioned “Notice of intention to conduct direct primary for the Edo State Governorship Election,” read in part, “I convey to you my compliments and wish to respectfully inform you that the All Progressives Congress has decided to conduct direct primary for the Edo State Governorship Election on Monday, 22nd of June, 2020. “To this end, we have put in place modalities to ensure strict compliance with the COVID-19 prevention guidelines as announced by the COVID-19 Presidential Task Force and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.
