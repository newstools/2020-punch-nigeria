Tunde Oyekola The Joint Kwara Labour Congress; a coalition of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Trade Union Congress and the Joint Negotiating Council, has appealed to the state governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, to sign the N30, 000 minimum wage agreement between the government and labour to ensure its implementation in the state. The congress at a joint press conference on Monday said the implementation of the new minimum wage was necessary because the effect of COVID-19 pandemic had negatively affected workers’ salaries. The Chairman of the JNC, Saliu Suleiman, stated that salaries of workers could no longer buy things they could purchase before the outbreak of the pandemic. He said, “If the government implements the new minimum wage for the state workers, it would assuage their problems a little in that they would be able to purchase some of their needs.” Other labour leaders who also spoke at the conference included the NLC state Chairman, Issa Ore; and the state TUC Chairman, Kolawole Olumoh, The union also appealed to the government to address the outstanding promotions in the public service and the local government councils between 2016 and 2020. It further drew the government’s attention to the outstanding benefits of the former workers of Kwara Hotels and the settlement of outstanding pensions owed by past administration. Copyright PUNCH.
