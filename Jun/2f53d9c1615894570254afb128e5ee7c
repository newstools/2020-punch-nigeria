Peter David, Benin Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, will not appeal the outcome of the screening of the All Progressives Congress for the governorship primary in the state. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, announced this in a statement on Friday. This follows his disqualification and two other aspirants from contesting the June 22 primary of the party. He said, “We have watched the mockery of the democratic process, which Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, is administering and superintending over in our great party the All Progressives Congress. It has been an unfortunate, disheartening, and dreadful spectacle.

The situation is quite saddening because this is a party supposedly reputed for change, equity, and social justice. “We have, therefore, decided that it would be an effort in futility to appeal whatever the unjust outcome of the evaluation and screening process of the APC will be, especially when Comrade Oshiomhole has declared that he is the Supreme Court and ultimate determiner of the fate and future of our great party. “We wish Oshiomhole well in his maladministration of the party and trust that the Almighty will help our country to find the path to true liberty, freedom, and justice. Long live Edo State. Long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”
