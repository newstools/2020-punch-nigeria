John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party has asked the All Progressives Congress and the Nigeria Police Force to stop what it said was an already lost battle, stressing that nothing could stop the imminent mass defection from the APC to the PDP across Nigeria. This was contained in a statement signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, on Sunday. The party described Saturday’s alleged attack on Ondo Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, by the APC, using the state Commissioner of Police, Bolaji Salami, as “rude and fraudulent”. Ologbondiyan said, “The thoughtless and rude attempt to use the Police to stop the Ondo Deputy Governor from leaving the disorganised APC is symptomatic of the last kicks of a degraded and derelict political party that is now clutching at straws and can only resort to use of compromised security agents as face-saving measure.
