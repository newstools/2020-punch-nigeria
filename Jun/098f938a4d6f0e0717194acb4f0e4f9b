Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The National Conscience Party has expressed shock over the death of its National General Secretary, Mr Ayodele Akele. The National Chairman of NCP, Yunusa Tanko, in a statement on Thursday, described Akele as “a pillar of democracy, a human rights crusader, a revolutionary par excellence, a committed class fighter, uncompromising activist and a leader at the barricade of struggles.” He noted that Akele died in Ondo State and not the United States. Tanko said, “On behalf of myself and my family, our great party, NCP, I commiserate with the family of Comrade Ayodele Akele, his wife and children. The news came with great pain, of his demise. My condolences are with his bereaved family and it is my prayer that Almighty Allah gives us all the fortitude to bear the loss. “He died on 23rd June, 2020 at his residence in Ondo state after a brief illness, against the ongoing rumours that he died outside the shores of Nigeria. “As we have always known, Comrade Akele lived a simple life worthy of emulation and accolades, and he never lived beyond his reach.” “We are in touch with his family, the children, friends and all organisations where he served, to give him a befitting burial, in line with COVID-19 protocols on public.” Copyright PUNCH.
