She added that she spent 42 days in the bandits’ camp because her family was unable to meet their request of N5 million ransom. Hadiza further revealed that one day, when her husband, through a phone call, told the bandits that he was able to raise N250, 000 only – which he offered to pay, the bandits warned him never to call them again. She said a lady and three other victims whom she met at the bandit’s camp were all released a few weeks ago after their families paid the requested ransom. Hadiza revealed she escaped on Friday when she was left with only one bandit to guard her, adding that luckily, the bandit slept off. After escaping, she began wandering inside the forest until she met some people who took her to the security agents in Gusau. The Director of Press to the SSG, Abdullahi Yar’adua, also confirmed the development through a statement made public on Saturday.
