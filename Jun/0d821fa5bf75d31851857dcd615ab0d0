Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Power distribution companies on Sunday blamed the high import duty on meters imposed by the Federal Government for the low metering of power users across the country. According to the Discos, the high import duty on meters was among the hurdles slowing their metering target under the Meter Asset Providers regulation. They disclosed this in a statement issued by their umbrella body, the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors, in Abuja. The Discos urged the Federal Government to intervene by reducing the cost of duty on imported meters as this would enable faster metering of power users and end the estimated billing regime.
