Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin Kwara State House of Assembly has urged the state Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, to hand over his predecessor, Abdulfattah Ahmed, and the Director General, KP3, Yomi Ogunsola, to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for investigation. The House equally urged the state government to hand over the consultants who handled the state Infrastructure Fund as well as a company, Reccofortezza-A Steven and Rubitec, contractors responsible for the Light-Up Kwara project. These resolutions were passed during plenary on Thursday. This followed the consideration of the report of an Ad-hoc Committee, which investigated the Light-up Kwara project executed by the Ahmed-led administration. Speaker of the House, Yakubu Danladi, while reading the resolutions, asked the executive to review the terms and conditions of the contract for the project and direct the contractors to complete all outstanding works. The House also advised the state government to order Ogunsola, the then Director General of KP3, to return to Nigeria to throw light on the grey areas of the project. Copyright PUNCH.
