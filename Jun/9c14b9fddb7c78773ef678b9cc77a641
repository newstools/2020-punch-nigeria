Kayode Oyero The Federal Government says it is not in a hurry to restart railway operations, The PUNCH has learnt. Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, said this is important so that trains don’t become conduits of circulation for the deadly coronavirus disease. The minister said when operations finally begin, commuters must comply with all health protocols including social distancing, use of face masks, amongst others as outlined by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. The Nigerian Railway Corporation had in March suspended all passenger services in the country to curb the spread of the lethal virus. In an update via his Twitter handle on Saturday night, Amaechi wrote, “We’re not in a hurry to start train operations because of the danger of covid19 spread. When we start, all health and safety protocols must apply. You will not enter a train if you don’t adhere to our rules. The train will not move if passengers do not comply.“ READ ALSO: Ibidunni’s mother planned house gift for daughter’s 40th birthday – Asue Ighodalo Meanwhile, the NRC said it has taken delivery of the last dozens of rail coaches ordered by the FG in March.
