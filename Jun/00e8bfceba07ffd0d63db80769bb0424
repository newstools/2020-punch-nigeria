Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State House of Assembly on Sunday denied conniving with the Special Adviser to the President on Political Affairs, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, to sabotage the administration of Dr Kayode Fayemi. The Chairman, House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Yemisi Ayokunle, said that the Five Pillars Agenda of the Fayemi government was enough to keep the lawmakers focused. Ayokunle in a statement in Ado Ekiti said, “We, as a House and with all emphasis at our disposal, categorically state that there is no member of our respected Assembly that has any relationship with the ex-senator.” She stated that the attention of the lawmakers had  been drawn to a statement made by Ojudu on a radio programme at Ikere Ekiti on Saturday where “the former senator claimed that some unnamed members of Ekiti State House of Assembly are sending to him, ‘documents of wrongdoings by the Ekiti State Government under Governor Fayemi.” She said, “This is a red herring from a persona that has been variously described as ‘anger and conspiracy’ in motion. “We therefore advise Senator Ojudu to look elsewhere for his co-travellers in his trademark game of divide and rule. Everyone is too aware of his character to take him seriously.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
