James Abraham, Jos The Plateau State House of Assembly has started an investigation into the missing N110m which was said to belong to Mangu Local Government Area of the state. It was learnt that part of the fund was meant for the unpaid salaries of the council workers for February 2018. It was further gathered that the decision of the House to probe the missing fund followed a petition by a group known as Concerned Workers Forum. The Chairman of the House Committee on Public Accounts and Petitions, Bala Fwangje, who confirmed the development told The Punch, in Jos, on Wednesday, that his committee had invited the council chairman and other people involved in the alleged deal with a view to recovering the missing fund. Fwangje said, “We have called the council chairman and his team and he confirmed to us that he knows something about the missing N110m. “The circumstances surrounding the fund actually preceded the present council chairman. The issue is that there was a contract which was successfully executed by the beneficiary since 2008. “The grand sum of the contract was N4m at the time and the contractor had been struggling to claim his money without success.” Copyright PUNCH.
