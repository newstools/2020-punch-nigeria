Johnny Edward Top European clubs seeking to add Umar Sadiq to their ranks have been asked to cough up €10m for the Nigerian, Saturday PUNCH reports. Striker Sadiq joined Partizan Belgrade on a permanent deal in January for a fee in the region of  €1.73m from AS Roma after the Serbs exercised their option to buy him. AC Milan, Valencia and Fenerbahce lead the race to sign the 23-year-old, who set up the only goal in Partizan’s 1-0 win over Red Star Belgrade in the Serbian Cup on Wednesday. Moscow rivals, CSKA and Spartak are also on Sadiq’s trail. The former U-23 striker endured a miserable spell after joining Glasgow Rangers from Roma in July 2018, making just four appearances without scoring, before his season-long deal was terminated five months later. But the Nigerian striker has rebuilt his reputation with Partizan, scoring 18 goals with 16 assists in 38 games for the Serbian giants this season. “Sadiq will cost at least €10m at the moment with his impressive performance this season,” a report on telegraf.rs stated. While at Roma Sadiq had loan spells at Bologna, Torino, NAC Breda, Glasgow Rangers, Perugia and Partizan. He is under contract until 2022 at Partizan. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
