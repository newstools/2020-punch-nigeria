The PUNCH had reported that Joshua, a 23-year-old man, was reportedly beaten to death by persons suspected to be his co-workers over a missing phone which he was accused of ‘stealing.’ The missing phone was later brought back to the owner by someone who had earlier taken it. In his homily at the funeral, Rev. Evans Bingila, of the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria, Yelwa, harped on forgiveness urging family and friends of the deceased particularly the youth not to break the law by trying to avenge Sunday’s murder.
