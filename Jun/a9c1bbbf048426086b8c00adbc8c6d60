Peter David, Benin An Edo High Court sitting in Benin City, the state capital, on Thursday, said the All Progressives Congress was right in granting a waiver to the party’s governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, to contest the June 22 primary. A factional Deputy Chairman of the APC in the state, Mr Kenneth Asekomhe, and three others, Benjamin Oghumu, Mathew Ogbebor, and Unweni Nosa, had dragged the party to court to challenge the May 21 waiver granted to Ize-Iyamu by members of the APC National Working Committee to contest the primary. The President Judge of the High Court (6) in Benin, Justice Emmanuel Ahamioje, dismissed the suit for lacking merit and he described the matter as an internal affair of APC. He affirmed Ize-Iyamu as a duly registered member of APC in his ward, saying he was qualified for the exercise. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
