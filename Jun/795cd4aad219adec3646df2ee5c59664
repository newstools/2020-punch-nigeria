Jurgen Klopp insists he does not want a statue in his honour as the Liverpool manager stayed humble in his first press conference as a Premier League champion. Manchester City’s loss at Chelsea on Thursday night means Liverpool have an unassailable lead at the top of the Premier League table, and so have clinched their first top-flight title in 30 years. It is Klopp’s fourth trophy at the club since arriving in 2015 and, after a night of celebrations, the manager spoke at Anfield on Friday about this latest triumph removing the burden of history from his players – and about a call he made to his family moments before the title win was confirmed. “I called my family 10 seconds before the final whistle,” Klopp revealed in a press conference. “I told them I loved them and they said they loved me. That was a really nice moment. “I was never sure it would happen, but I never doubted it. It’s incredible. We were good four years ago, really good three years ago, unbelievable last season, and this season is absolutely exceptional – second to none. “I still want to live for 30 or 40 years, I’m not interested in a statue. You don’t have to compare me with these iconic figures. “The last 13 months were pretty special for us. It is an incredible time in my life, to be honest. I couldn’t be more thankful to be part of it. And we will not stop. “The last 13 months were pretty special for us. It is an incredible time in my life, to be honest. I couldn’t be more thankful to be part of it. And we will not stop. “I cannot promise that we’ll win something, but I can promise that we will try our hardest to improve.
