Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative on Tuesday commended the decision by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to make public its audited accounts for the first time in its history. NEITI said the move fulfilled a pledge made by NNPC’s Group Managing Director, Mele Kyari, to ensure transparency and accountability at the national oil firm. The Executive Secretary, NEITI, Waziri Adio, said, “We welcome the eventual fulfillment of this important pledge and obligation. “Given NNPC’s antecedents and its prominent role in the sector and in the country, the publication of its audited accounts is positive, signalling more openness for the oil and gas sector and for Nigeria. “When combined with the monthly reports that the NNPC started publishing in 2016, this development marks a sea-change for a national oil company that used to be renowned for opacity. “We urge the NNPC to make this a routine practice and to mainstream transparency into all facets of its operations.” NEITI also requested the oil firm to go farther by publishing its previous audited accounts and in open data formats so that the reports could be more accessible to the citizenry.
