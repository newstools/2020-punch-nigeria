Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo An artisanal miner from Katsina State, Ahmed Tijani, on Tuesday bagged a one-year jail term for being in possession of Indian hemp. Justice Peter Lifu of the Federal High Court sitting in Osogbo, Osun State, found Tijani guilty of illegal possession of 1.5kg of Indian hemp after the convict admitted to the crime. The prosecutor, Ogaga Azuigo, an officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, explained that Tijani was arrested at Ijana village in the Ilesha East Local Government Area of Osun State. Azuigo added that the offence was contrary to Section 19 of the NDLEA Act, Cap N30, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. Tijani said he was an artisanal miner for about two years before venturing into dealing in cannabis. The convict said he came from Katsina State to work in Osun, adding that the man, who was giving him money for feeding, suddenly embarked on a trip outside the state, a development that exposed him to hardship. His counsel, Mr Bola Abimbola-Ige, pleaded with the court to be lenient with his client because he was a first time offender. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
