John Alechenu, Abuja The Ondo state governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party during the 2016 elections, Mr Eyitayo Jegede (SAN), has expressed his desire to take another shot at the seat. Jegede, who was at the PDP National Secretariat, Abuja, on Wednesday, to collect his nomination and expression of interest forms, told reporters he was in the race to win and fulfil his dreams for the state. Speaking on his plans for the state, he said he would “establish a sea port, tackle schools dropout syndrome affecting children, empower youths, and bring integrity to politics in the state,” if elected. In response to a question about how he intends to raise the funds to accomplish the feat Jegede said, “If the current governor could use over N5bn to build one small bridge,  I can get the funds.” Copyright PUNCH.
