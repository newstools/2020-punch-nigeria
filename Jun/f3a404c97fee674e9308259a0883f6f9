JAMES ABRAHAM One person has been confirmed dead and 11 injured in a multiple road accident which occurred in Jos, the Plateau State capital, on Saturday. According to eyes witnesses, the accident occurred around 11am when a truck conveying petrol lost control at the Polo Roundabout, Jos, and rammed into several vehicles. The Federal Road Safety Corps Public Education Officer in the state, Mr Andrew Bala, who confirmed the incident to Sunday PUNCH, said the injured victims had been taken to hospital for treatment while the corpse had been deposited in a morgue. He blamed the accident on mechanical fault which led to the truck’s brake failure. Bala said, “A total of 12 people and 11 vehicles including seven tricycles, one tanker and three cars were involved in the accident.  The tanker was loaded with petrol when it rammed into the other vehicles due to a possible break failure. “Unfortunately, one male adult died. Eleven others comprising one child, two males and eight females, sustained injuries. They have all been taken to the hospital.” Bala advised motorists to exercise caution and always conduct routine checks on their vehicles to avoid unnecessary loss of lives and property.
