John Charles, Makurdi The Benue State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, John Ngbede, has said aggressive and rigorous campaigns were largely responsible for the party’s convincing victory during last Saturday’s local government election in the state. Ngbede said this at a press conference at the party’s secretariat in Makurdi on Monday. He described the opposition All Progressive Congress as “already dead” in the state. Ngbede further said, “The PDP won the election because we have been campaigning while other parties were busy going to court. This is a form of compensation the PDP could get from people. “The APC was not ready for the election because they didn’t even go to buy forms from BSIEC. The party is dead in the state; forget about names of people you are hearing. Benue people exercised their franchise and we won overwhelmingly. The state APC publicity secretary, James Orgunga, had in a statement on Friday said the party was boycotting the poll alleging that the PDP had already predetermined the outcome. The party had gone to court to challenge the process. Copyright PUNCH.
