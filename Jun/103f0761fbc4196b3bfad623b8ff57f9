Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Federal High Court in Abuja has been asked to disqualify Governor Godwin Obaseki from contesting the forthcoming governorship election in the state for allegedly forging his university certificate. The election is scheduled to hold in Edo State on September 19. The suit was filed on May 29, 2020 by Edobor Williams, Ugesia Godwin and Amedu Anakhu. Joined as respondents to the suit were the governors’ party, the All Progressives Congress, the Inspector-General of Police and Obaseki himself. The plaintiffs alleged in the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/553/2020, that the University of Ibadan certificate which he attached to his Form CF.001 which he submitted to INEC for his first term election in 2016 was forged. They argued that the governor’s educational information contained in Part C of the Form CF 001 which he submitted to INEC on July 12, 2016 and the first degree certificate of Bachelor of Arts in Classical Studies, said to have been obtained from the University of Ibadan, Ibadan, was forged. They contended that this was “contrary to the provisions of section 182(1)(i) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999”. According to them, Obaseki was therefore “not qualified to run or seek the office of Governor of Edo State under the platform of the 1st defendant (APC) in the governorship election scheduled to hold in the state on September 19, 2020”. No date has been fixed for the suit.
