Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The management of the Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesha, Osun State, has ordered the discharge of two patients detained over their inability to settle bills after treatment. PUNCH Metro had reported that two non-governmental organisations, the Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre, and the Centre for Reproductive Rights, petitioned the Minster of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, over the detention of the patients. The NGOs alleged that Funmilayo Taiwo and Taiwo Olowokere were being detained unlawfully because they could not settle their bills. The Public Relations Officer of the hospital, Kemi Fasooto, explained in a message sent to our correspondent on Monday that the Chief Medical Director, Prof. Victor Adetiloye, had directed that the patients be discharged immediately discharged. “The CMD has instructed that the two patients be allowed to go home and their unpaid bills have been written off,” Fasooto stated. The Executive Director of WARDC, Dr Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, confirmed the release of the patients. Copyright PUNCH.
