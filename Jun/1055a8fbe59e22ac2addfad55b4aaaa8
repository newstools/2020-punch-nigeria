John Alechenu, Abuja Former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has said the APC was fast becoming a threat to the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd). Odigie-Oyegun said this in a statement he signed in Abuja, on Saturday. According to him, the fact remains that a government’s performance is not only judged by its infrastructural development but also by its politics. He cited an example with the annulment of the June 12, 1993 election by a former military dictator, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. In the statement titled ‘Before its too Late’, Odigie-Oyegun said, “Our own political party, the APC, is fast becoming the single most dangerous threat to the legacy of our government and our President.

Therefore, the significant progressive opposition parties and indeed all men and women of goodwill joined forces, not only to bring it back on course but also to set it on a completely different trajectory that would restore the hopes of our people and make every Nigerian proud of this great country again.” He urged leaders of the party to convene a National Executive Committee meeting of the party and agree to set up interim management to pilot the affairs of the party in order to return the party to a position of strength.
