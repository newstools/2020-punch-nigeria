Peter Dada, Akure AS it is being insinuated that the Ondo State Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi, will join the Peoples Democratic Party, some of the frontline PDP aspirants, say that Ajayi coming to the PDP will boost the PDP’s chance of taking over the state in 2021. One of the aspirants, Chief Olusola Ebiseni, said he was not perturbed by the coming of Ajayi to the party, but described his (Ajayi’s) joining as a good democratic development. He said, “The PDP has an umbrella big for all. He is welcomed like other bigwigs of other parties willing to pitch their tents with the PDP winning team.” In the same vein, another aspirant and former governorship candidate of the party in 2016, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, said as an aspirant fully on the ground, he had the structure of the party. He said, “Jegede has been and remains fully on the ground, having been the arrowhead of the PDP structure in Ondo State post-2016 elections. Not only that, I have equally been building the party since 2016. I have remained at the home base since then. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
