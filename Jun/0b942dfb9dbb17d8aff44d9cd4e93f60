Oladimeji Ramon The Federal High Court in Lagos has ordered that a sum of N250m allegedly diverted from the Niger Delta Development Commission should be forfeited to the Federal Government. The court, in a ruling on Wednesday by Justice Rilwan Aikawa, made the interim forfeiture order. The order followed an ex parte application by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The Head of Media and Publicity at the EFCC, Dele Oyewale, said in a statement on Thursday that Justice Aikawa granted the prayers in the ex parte application following argument by the commission’s counsel, Usman Buhari.

The matter was adjourned till July 9, 2020.
