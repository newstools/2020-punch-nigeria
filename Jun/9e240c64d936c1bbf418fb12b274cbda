Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa THE Bayelsa State Police Command said it had rescued the 80-year-old mother of Chairman of the Yenagoa Local Government Area, Madam Beauty Nimizuoa. Uroupaye Nimizuoa’s mother was kidnapped by five gunmen at her Agudama-Ekpetiama country home on March 5. The State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Nkereuwem Akpan, who said this while parading some suspected criminals at the Command’s headquarters in Yenagoa, also disclosed that some abducted workers of Shell Petroleum Development Company were also rescued. Akpan, however, did not disclose if any of the abductors of the Yenagoa council chairman’s octogenarian mother and the SPDC workers were arrested. Akpan said, “It is instructive to state that the Command has rescued kidnapped victims. Worthy of note is the rescue of Shell Petroleum Development Company workers and the 80 years old mother of the Chairman of Yenagoa Local Government Council, Madam Beauty Nimizuoa. “I’m hopeful that with this level of commitment and engagements from the people of Bayelsa State, we will together drive community policing initiative forward and make our communities safer again.” Copyright PUNCH.
