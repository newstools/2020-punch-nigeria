Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The Coalition of Northern Groups on Thursday said its chairman of the Board of Trustees, Nastura Ashir Sharif, has been freed after two days in police captivity. Sharif was arrested Tuesday afternoon and moved to Abuja shortly after peaceful protests in Katsina against the killings of helpless and defenceless citizens by bandits. The CNG’s Board of Trustees’ chairman’s release was announced by the spokesman of the group, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, in a statement in Kaduna on Thursday. The statement said, “We acknowledge that Sharif’s freedom was made possible by the enormous pressure exerted by the CNG, the Northern Elders Forum, patriotic leaders and elders of the North, a decent section of the civil society, a multi-sectoral cooperation of regional groups and activists and the vigilance of the national and international press. “We equally appreciate the support, cooperation, and patience of the entire northern public throughout the period of Shariff’s detention. This is indeed reassuring. “We assure the public that we shall never relent in our struggle for a decent, free, fair, and just society no matter the odds. “We urge authorities to endeavour to always place value on human liberty and people’s rights as basic cornerstones for civilized democracy.”
