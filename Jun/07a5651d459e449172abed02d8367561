Bruno Fernandes’s penalty salvaged a 1-1 draw for Manchester United at Tottenham as the Red Devils had another late spot-kick overturned by a VAR review on Friday. Jose Mourinho was on course to get the better of his former club when Steven Bergwijn’s strike gave Spurs a half-time lead. However, United’s second-half pressure finally told nine minutes from time when Fernandes converted from the spot after Paul Pogba had been brought down in the box. Fernandes then thought he had won a second penalty, but a VAR review decided there was little contact as he went down under a challenge from Eric Dier. A point does little for either side’s chances of breaking into the top four. United remain in fifth, two points behind Chelsea, while Spurs are four points further back in eighth. In keeping with all matches since the Premier League’s return earlier this week, all players and officials took a knee before kick in protest against racial injustice. AFP
