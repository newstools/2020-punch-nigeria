Peter Dada, Akure As the primaries of the Ondo State All Progressives Congress draws near, members of the party have been divided over the mode of primaries for party in the state . The state Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, however, declared on Saturday he was ready for either direct or indirect primaries. Speaking through the state Commissioner for Information, Mr Donald Ojogo, the governor expressed confidence that he would win the party ticket and the main election in July and October respectively. He said, “We are not afraid of any direct primaries; the noise being orchestrated by members of the Unity Forum is to bring impression  that Governor Akeredolu is afraid of direct primaries. “I want to tell you that we will prefer direct primaries, those that saying we are opposed to direct are wasting their time. We are even more prepared for direct than indirect, even more than those saying they want direct. “We are going to the primaries to win, we are going to the election in October to win.” On the ongoing cold war between the governor and his deputy, Mr Agboola Ajayi, the commissioner said Akeredolu had been showing good leadership quality on the matter, as he had refused the call for the removal of the deputy.
