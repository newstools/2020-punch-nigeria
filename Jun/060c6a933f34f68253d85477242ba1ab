Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The wife of the Governor of Ogun State, Mrs Bamidele Abiodun, on Monday led a protest to the Governor Office, Abeokuta, against rape and gender-based violence. Mrs Abiodun, while leading some women during “a peaceful walk and awareness” campaign, called on the three arms of government in the state to support the action against gender-based violence and rape. She decried the gruesome rape and killings of Tina Ezekwe, Uwavera Omozua, Barakat Bello and Jennifer that occurred recently among others. She noted that the governor, Dapo Abiodun, recently inaugurated a committee that would ensure the development of an effective response to cases of sexual-based violence in  the state, urging the committee to develop strategies to prevent and combat such acts. She said   “We need to do more and ensure our survivors are not stigmatised, justice served, and the emotional and mental well-being of survivors are  prioritised. “I also humbly request that we continue to involve men in national conversation on violence against women. To the men already supporting this cause; thank you for speaking up.” The state governor commended his wife and her team, reiterating his commitment to ensuring that cases which bordered on women and girl-child violence were expedited to bring the offenders to book. Earlier, the Speaker of the  state House of Assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, promised on behalf of the legislature to give accelerated hearing to any bill that affect women and children. Copyright PUNCH.
