John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party has urged the Federal Government to “stop fleecing Nigerians” with the high cost of petrol by immediately reducing the pump price to N70 per litre to reflect current global realities. The party also rejected the new price of N121 per litre as announced by the Federal Government. This was contained in a press statement signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, on Tuesday. The Statement read in part, “The party insists that a N121 per litre price amounts to fleecing Nigerians of over N50 per liter of fuel. “This is in continuation of the N55 per litre overcharge, which Nigerians had borne under the inappropriate N125 per litre, which prevailed for months, before it was brought down to N123.5 per litre, in spite of the crash in international price of crude oil. “The PDP rejects the unnecessary price pinching and demands that the Federal Government, should without further delay, implement the appropriate price as well as declare and account for the billions of naira accruable as overcharge since the crash in crude oil price. “The failure to reduce the pump price as well as the non-declaration of the overcharge is completely unacceptable to Nigerians, as it only points to questions of corruption in the system.” The PDP urged the National Assembly to protect the interest of the people by using their legislative instruments to prevail on the Federal Government to implement the appropriate fuel pricing and account for the overcharges.
