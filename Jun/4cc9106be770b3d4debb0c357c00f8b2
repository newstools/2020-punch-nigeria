ARMSTRONG BAKAM A petrol tanker which exploded at Azare, headquarters of Katagum local government area of Bauchi state has reportedly killed two people. Our correspondent learnt that the incident occurred on Friday at about 3am when the tanker discharging its contents at a fuel station in the town exploded and killed two persons. A source told Sunday PUNCH that the tanker was going out of the town when a cable fell on it causing it to explode and went up in flames; a development that caused confusion in the town forcing people to rush out of their homes for safety. The source added that the incident occurred at the First Bank roundabout along the General Hospital Road within the Azare town. “It was in the process of scampering for safety that the two people trapped in the tanker believed to be the driver and motor boy were burnt to death. Their bodies were later evacuated and deposited at the General Hospital morgue,” he said. The Police Public Relations Officer, Bauchi State Command, DSP Ahmed Wakil, when contacted confirmed the incident.
