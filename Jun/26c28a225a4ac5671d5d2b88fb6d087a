Ada Wodu, Calabar The police in Calabar have arrested a retired army captain, Bassey Ekanem, for allegedly defiling his four-year old niece. The incident happened at Ekanem’s residence at 12, Edim Ibangha Street, Big Qua Town, Calabar. According to a source, Ekanem, who is in his 60s, claimed he was under the influence of alcohol. A neighbour, who pleaded not to be named, revealed that Ekanem, “had sent the lady living with him to the market; then he lured the little girl into his apartment and started fingering her and broke her hymen in the process. “It was the victim’s younger brother who is about two years old who told their mother that grandpa put his hand inside her sister’s bum-bum before their mother raised the alarm and the matter was reported to the police.” The Principal Counsel, Basic Right Council Initiative, James Ibor, said, “This particular matter cannot be swept under the carpet and the suspect must face the full wrath of the law even though they are related.” The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, said, “The man is in our custody. I won’t say much until we get the medical report on the incident.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
