John Charles, Makurdi Police in Benue State on Friday killed seven suspected armed robbers along Lafia-Makurdi Road. According to a statement by the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Catherine Anene, the suspected robbers reportedly engaged policemen in a gun duel for about 20 minutes. The statement indicated that the suspected armed robbers were operating on the same spot a police inspector, Boniface Odeh, was killed a week ago. The statement read in part, “Following reports about armed robbery incidents and the attack of a police checkpoint on June 4, 2020  on Lafia-Makurdi Road that led to the death of Inspector Boniface Odeh and the loss of an AK-47 rifle, a team of police officers were detailed to trail the armed robbers terrorising commuters on the road. “While on the trail, information was received on June 12 at 4.40am that armed robbers were operating on the same road. A team of police officers swiftly moved to the scene and met the hoodlums dressed in military camouflage and police uniforms. “They engaged the police in a gun duel that lasted for about 20 minutes. In the process, seven of the armed robbers sustained various degrees of bullet wounds and were rushed to the Benue State University Teaching Hospital where they eventually died. Their corpses had been deposited at the morgue for autopsy.” Anene listed items recovered from the suspects to include the missing AK-47 rifle, one other AK-47 rifle loaded with live ammunition, one locally-made pistol with two cartridges, two den guns, four torches, four machetes, nine cell phones and assorted charms. The command spokesperson warned criminals in the state to desist from their evil ways or face the full wrath of the law. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
