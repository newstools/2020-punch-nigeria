Joseph Olaoluwa Aviation unions have expressed their displeasure with the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency’s decision to slash the salary of workers in the month of June. The union warned that the failure to pay full salaries to NAMA’s workers would amount to gross embarrassment, not only to the aviation industry but to the whole country. It advised NAMA against the decision, promising that there would be grave consequences. The workers made their stance known in a joint letter signed by the General Secretary of Nigeria Union of Air Transport Employees, Ocheme Aba, and the secretaries of the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, Association of Nigerian Aviation Professionals and Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service Technical. The letter read in part, “Going forward, we are compelled to suggest that the management be properly guided on how to address issues that concern salaries of our members in the agency.” The unions advised the agency to pay all salaries and entitlements to its members in full on or before June 29 or risk any action that would be taken to protect its workers.
