Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja All Progressives Congress chieftain, Bola Tinubu, has called on the immediate-past National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, to return to Edo State to ‘energise’ the campaign of the party’s governorship candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu. Tinubu said this in a statement on Saturday while reacting to the dissolution of the National Working Committee by the President, Maj.Gen Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). The former governor of Lagos State said, “In Edo, we must rally round our candidate Pastor Osagie Ize Iyamu. In this, Comrade Oshiomhole has a crucial role to play. I congratulate him for his equanimity and loyalty to the party and our President in accepting the dissolution of the NWC. I encourage him, now, to return to Edo State to energise the campaign for the election of Pastor Ize-Iyamu.” READ ALSO: Tinubu waxes philosophical on APC crisis, mum on 2023 ambition Oshiomhole has been engaged in a battle with his successor, Governor Godwin Obaseki, who is seeking a second term in office.
