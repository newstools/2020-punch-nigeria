Oladimeji Ramon The Lagos State Government has approached the Supreme Court, praying that virtual court hearings, necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic, should be validated. The state’s Attorney General and Commission for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), in the suit, urged the Supreme Court to hold that virtual court hearings are constitutional as they do not offend Section 36 of the Constitution. Joined as defendants in the suit are the Attorney General of the Federation and the National Assembly. The Lagos AG wants the Supreme Court to hold that it was not necessary to amend the Constitution, particular Section 36, to make virtual court hearings valid and constitution. He is urging the apex court to the Attorney General of the Federation and the National Assembly from taking steps to amend Section 36 of the Constitution, so as not to render a nullity all the virtual court proceedings already conducted in Lagos via Zoom, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, Skype or any other audiovisual or video-conference platform.

He contended that allowing the National Assembly to tinker with Section 36 of the constitution would amount to a usurpation of the powers of the Lagos CJ under Section 274 of the Constitution. Onigbanjo urged the Supreme Court to hold that a bill presented to the National Assembly seeking an amendment to Section 36 of the Constitution by including remote court hearing was a nullity.
