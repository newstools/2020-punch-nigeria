Enyioha Opara, Minna THE Niger State Water and Sewage Corporation has said security agencies in the state are owing over N300m for water supply. The corporation also bemoaned the refusal of government functionaries, including legislators, commissioners and some tertiary institutions in the state, to pay water bills. The Assistant General Manager, Commercial Services, NSWSC, Aliyu Umar, said this in Minna on Monday. Umar disclosed that the amount of domestic and commercial debts owed the corporation was N700m, adding that the corporation was finding it difficult to recover the money. “We all know the army barracks is not a place one can enter anyhow, also, the police and prison service are not places one can just go and disconnect their water sources. “We have engaged a consultant to begin a dialogue with these agencies and we have started engaging on how they can pay us. The money is much needed and we need them to pay. “It is quite disheartening that a lot of top government officials refused to pay for water they have used. It is sad because domestic water payment is just N1,000 monthly but these personalities believe that water is free but they do not know that the cost of production is very expensive.” Copyright PUNCH.
