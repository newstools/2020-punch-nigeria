Oladimeji Ramon The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals, Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, has denied allegation of missing N23bn in her office. Orelope-Adefulire, who is a former deputy governor of Lagos State, described as reckless and mischievous the claim that the alleged missing N23bn was traced to the personal account of a former worker in her office. A statement on Sunday by the Head of Communication, OSSAP-SDGs, Janet McDickson, urged Nigerians to ignore the reports of the missing N23bn. “It must also be stated that the National Assembly, amazed by the spurious allegations in the reports, had also debunked insinuations that the allocation to OSSAP-SDGs in the 2020 budget was padded with the sum of N33bn and absolved both the person of Princess Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire and OSSAP-SDGs of such financial Impropriety. “The statement signed by the House Committee Chairman on SDGs, Hon. Rotimi Agunsoye, read in part, ‘The House Committee on SDGs got records from the OSSAP-SDGs and Appropriation Committee, which shows the said additional N33bn was not appropriated for SDGs Office among provisions of the 2020 budget earlier assented by Mr President.’ “The Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on SDGs is committed to the discharge of its core mandates, including President Muhammadu Buhari’s fight against corruption,” the statement said.
