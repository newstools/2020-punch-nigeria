The Federal Controller of Works in Lagos, Mr Kayode Popoola, on Friday said the Kara Bridge on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway was being partially closed for integrity test, which would begin on Saturday (today). The News Agency of Nigeria reported Popoola as saying an integrity test was necessary to ascertain the stability of the bridge, following a recent tanker fire that occurred on it. He said the removal of the wreckage was likely to be done later on Friday by the contractor, Julius Berger, and the bridge would be partially closed with traffic diverted for work to begin on Saturday, June 27. He said traffic would be diverted to two lanes, instead of the original three on the highway, and appealed for the motorists’ cooperation and understanding. Popoola said, “Kara Bridge got burnt and we have to carry out an integrity test. The test will be done by Julius Berger Nigeria Ltd. “Hopefully, they will remove the wreckage today and then put barriers there, then the work will start tomorrow (Saturday). “There is going to be a partial closure of one lane, in the sense that instead of three lanes, traffic will now be restricted to only two lanes, that is, the Ibadan-bound lane. “The work will be done on Saturday and Sunday, they will finish hopefully on Sunday. “We advise motorists to please slow down and allow us to work so that avoidable accidents can be avoided.” A fire incident had occurred on the Kara Bridge on June 21 when two tankers laden with petrol crashed inwards Lagos.
