Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency, AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (retd.) said on Thursday that the agency’s air operation had been grounded due to its faulty planes and helicopters. NEMA DG stated this before the Senate Committee on Special Duties on budgetary provisions for the agency in the 2019 and 2020 fiscal year and the operational challenges confronting  it. He said, “NEMA is more or less incapacitated in the air since both the executive jet or air ambulance and the only available helicopter are not functional.” “For the air ambulance undergoing repairs, parts being sought for in  France are still being expected. “ The COVID -19 pandemic is not even helping matters as  cancellation of flights from one country to the other over the months has slowed down the process of putting the air ambulance in good shape of air worthiness. “ The same fate is also befalling our operational helicopter which has remained grounded.” Copyright PUNCH.
