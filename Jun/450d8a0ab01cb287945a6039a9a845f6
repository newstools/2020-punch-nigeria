Johnny Edward Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has praised Odion Ighalo’s all-round abilities after the striker bagged his fifth goal in just four starts for the Reds in their 2-1 win over Norwich City in an Emirates FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday. Ighalo was one of the eight changes Solskjaer made to the side and he performed his task with aplomb. The Nigerian showed great awareness and composure to poke home the opener during the encounter and also played a part in the build-up to Harry Maguire’s winner. “Odion (Ighalo) gives me a chance to rotate,” Solskjaer told BBC Sport. “He’s a proven goalscorer and played his part in both goals. He is a great person to have around the dressing room too. “Ighalo knows how much we value him in and around the dressing room, he’s a goalscorer, a poacher, he’s strong, we can play the ball into him, he showed for the second and Paul (Pogba) found him.” “He’s got one eye on the ball. Probably one eye is on the keeper coming to smash him and the defender coming to smash him, so well done.” Meanwhile, Ighalo is thrilled with the Red Devils’ progress into the Emirates FA Cup semi-final. Ighalo took to social media to celebrate the win. “Semi-finals,” the former Nigeria international tweeted. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
