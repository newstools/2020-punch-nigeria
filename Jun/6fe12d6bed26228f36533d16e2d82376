Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Ekiti State Deputy Governor, Chief Bisi Egbeyemi, on Saturday dismissed claims in some quarters that drinking local gin popularly known as ‘ogogoro’ or local herbs could prevent COVID-19. Rather, the deputy governor said the best prevention remained strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocols of hand washing/sanitizing, use of face masks and physical distancing in addition to personal hygiene, and maintaining a clean environment. Egbeyemi, who made remarks while monitoring the June edition of the monthly environmental sanitation exercise in Ido/Osi Council area, frowned at the abandonment of face masks by many residents since the lockdown was relaxed in the state. According to a statement by the Special Assistant (Media) to the Deputy Governor, Odunayo Ogunmola, the deputy governor enjoined residents to always wear their face masks, wash their hands regularly avoid crowded areas, and observe social distancing so as not to fall victims to the disease. He said, “Drinking ogogoro or local herbs can’t prevent COVID-19, having such belief is a fallacy. Let us obey all the rules including wearing face masks which many people have abandoned since the lockdown was relaxed, it is for our own good. “COVID-19 is real and we have heard about many people it has killed including very distinguished and prominent Nigerians who contracted the disease but didn’t survive it. “Let’s follow COVID-19 rules and protocols of regular hand washing, wearing of face masks, avoiding crowds and observance of physical and social distancing,” the deputy governor said.
