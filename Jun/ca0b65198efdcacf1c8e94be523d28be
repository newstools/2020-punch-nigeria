Oladimeji Ramon The Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice John Tsoho, has “strongly advised” judges of the court against granting ex parte injunctions in political cases brought before them. The Chief Judge’s advice was contained in a circular dated June 24, 2020, released on Thursday. Justice Tsoho reminded the judges that the immediate-past Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice Adamu Abdu-Kafarati (retd.), had in an earlier circular in August 2018 warned the judges against granting ex parte orders in political matters. He said the advice still applied. “In this regard, Your Lordships are strongly advised not to grant any ex parte injunctive orders in any political matter brought before Your Lordships,” the circular signed by Justice Tsoho read partly. He also advised the judges not to entertain matters which cause of action arises from outside their judicial divisions. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
