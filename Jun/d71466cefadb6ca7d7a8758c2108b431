James Abraham, Jos THE kidnappers, who abducted the father of a former Plateau State governor, Joshua Dariye, has demanded the sum of N100 million to release the over 90-year-old man, Pa Defwan Dariye. A source close to the former governor told our correspondent that the kidnappers had made contact with the family members and had insisted that it was either the N100m was paid or the nonagenarian would not regain his freedom. Recall that Dariye’s father’s latest abduction on Thursday was the second time the man would be taken away by gunmen. The source, who would not want his name in print, said, “They (kidnappers) have made contact with the family and they are demanding the sum of N100m as ransom.” Meanwhile, the Police Command in the state on Tuesday said the search to free the father of the former governor was still ongoing. The Public Relations Officer for the Plateau State Police Command, Mr Ubah Ogaba, who spoke with our correspondent in Jos on Tuesday, said his men had yet to locate his whereabouts. Copyright PUNCH.
