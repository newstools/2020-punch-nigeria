Adelani Adepegba and Sampson Itode The fate of the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, on Wednesday took an unexpected turn as a suit filed by a governorship aspirant, Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama, seeking to stop Obaseki from contesting the Peoples Democratic Party primary scheduled for Thursday (today) was struck out. Ogbeide-Ihama had vowed not to step down for Obaseki, from the All Progressives Congress  who recently joined the PDP But on Wednesday, a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt struck out the suit instituted by Ogbeide-Ihama, after his lawyer, D. C. Denwigwe (SAN), orally withdrew the suit before Justice E. O. Obile. The counsel for Ogbeide-Ihama had earlier sought the leave of the court to settle with the defendants in the matter, which was granted. After an amicable out of court settlement among the parties in the matter, the plaintiff told the court that all parties had agreed that the matter be withdrawn from the court. Justice Obile, in granting the plaintiff’s request, struck out the suit and commended the parties for settling out of court, adding that it was the proper thing to do.

While addressing party members in Edo State on Wednesday, Ogebide-Ihama promised to support the winner of the PDP primary if the exercise followed the due process. Copyright PUNCH.
