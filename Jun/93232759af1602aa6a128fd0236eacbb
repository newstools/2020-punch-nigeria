Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Some gunmen on Wednesday invaded Tudu village in Agwala Dutse general area in the Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing no fewer than nine persons. The latest killing is coming on the heels of another attack on the same Kajuru communities where the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union alleged that no fewer than 30 decomposed bodies of its members were left in the bush after suspected Fulani herdsmen attacked 15 communities. A source told our correspondent that several other persons were injured in the Wednesday attack which took place around 5am. He said, “There was an attack on Tudu village in Agwala Dutse at about 5am today (Wednesday) and people were killed while several others sustained injuries.” Although the police in the state have not confirmed the attack, the Kajuru Local Government Chairman, Mr Cafra Caino, said nine people lost their lives. Caino said a detailed inventory of casualties were being taken, adding that security operatives had been mobilised to the community. He said, “Nine lives were lost in the attack. But the position of Kajuru LGA remains that all communities must recourse to the law as against engaging in killings and reprisals.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
