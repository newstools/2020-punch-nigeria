James Abraham, Jos A private hospital in Plateau state, Rayfield Medical Services Limited, has been shut. It was learnt on Wednesday that the hospital, located in the Rayfield area of Jos, was shut down by the state’s Task Force on COVID-19 following the discovery that a COVID-19 patient, who absconded from one of the state facilities, was receiving treatment in the hospital. A worker at the hospital said the patient had stayed for two days before the state’s ministry of health visited the hospital. She said, “A screening of primary and secondary contacts revealed that a number of our workers were also positive for the virus. “The hospital was asked to shut down for two weeks to give room for fumigation.” The Chairman of the National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives, JUTH branch, Mr Mercy Lenka, said, “We are aware that the hospital has shut down. It’s an unfortunate situation.” The state’s Commissioner for Health, Dr Nimkong Lar, also said he was aware of the closure of the private hospital. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
