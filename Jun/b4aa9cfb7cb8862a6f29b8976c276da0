Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has pledged to keep fighting until no child in Britain goes hungry after helping raise around £20 million ($25 million) for charity during the coronavirus lockdown. The 22-year-old England star teamed up with FareShare, an organisation that distributes food to nearly 11,000 frontline charities and community groups. “I have amazing news!” he tweeted. “We had a goal that by the end of June we would be able to supply 3 million meals to vulnerable people across the UK.
