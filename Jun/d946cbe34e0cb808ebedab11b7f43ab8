’Tosin Oluwalowo Super Falcons striker, Asisat Oshoala, says the decision to restart football when the COVID-19 pandemic is still on is not safe for footballers. The Spanish Primera Iberdrola had ended the league and awarded the title to Barcelona, who were nine points ahead of second-placed Atletico Madrid. The Spanish La Liga is set to return this month along with the Premier League and Serie A. The German Bundesliga resumed May 16 with games played behind closed doors. “We were at the run of winning a treble or even four trophies this season. Atletico were out of the Cup already, so, we were more pained, we were more affected because we were already nine points ahead,” the four-time African Women’s Player of The Year said on an Instagram Live video. “These things happen like once, in a century, so, we have to consider the fact that it’s something that is not healthy for us. We want to win the league on the pitch and celebrate with the fans but these things (pandemic) happen. “To be honest, to resume the league right now is still not healthy. Anyone can go home after the game and infect others during a game next time. It is not safe right now but then, it is what it is,” she added. Copyright PUNCH.
