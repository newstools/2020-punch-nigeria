Tunde Ajaja There is a growing concern over a suspected corpse abandoned under the Berger Bridge on Isheri-Olowoora Road in Lagos State. While it is difficult to ascertain whether the person, who appeared to be a middle-aged man, is dead or not, our correspondent observed that the body had been there for days with the condition deteriorating by the day. On Wednesday when our correspondent called the Lagos State emergency number to notify them of the development, the official who answered the call said they had been notified and that those assigned to handle the situation were already on their way. But as of Saturday afternoon, the body was still lying there. On a closer look at the body on Saturday afternoon, the face had turned black while flies were already hovering over the body. When our correspondent sampled the opinion of people around the area on whether they felt the person was still alive or not, some of them argued that the person must still be alive for the body not to have swollen as is typical of corpses. Some others, however, argued that the person must have died given that it had been motionless for days, the face had turned black and flies already surrounded the body. “That body has been there for months; he used to beg for alms at that spot and some passersby occasionally gave him food and money,” a shop owner close to the bridge told Sunday PUNCH. “But for some time now, he has been motionless, fuelling assumptions that he was dead. The irony now is that the body has not swelled neither is there foul smell around there. Government should do something about it before it poses health hazard.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
