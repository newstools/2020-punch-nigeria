Peter Dada, Akure Ondo State Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, has dissociated himself from posters carrying his photograph, campaigning for governorship under the platform of the Social Democratic Party. His posters in SDP had flooded the social media lately. Ajayi, who recently joined the Peoples Democratic Party, said he remained loyal to the party and did not have any link with any other party. Speaking through his media, Allen Sowore, the deputy governor said the matter was the handiwork of mischief makers, who had tried unsuccessfully to pitch him with the leadership of the PDP.

We would not have responded to this fake and unsubstantiated story if not for unsuspecting members of the public. “There was no time the deputy governor addressed the press after his official declaration for the PDP on Monday 22nd June, 2020.” The deputy governor urged the public to disregard the posters, saying, “It is understandable that it will take a very long time for the All Progressives Congress, to recover from the whammy which the defection has caused.”
