Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Osun State has recorded six new cases of coronavirus, as well as one death from the pandemic. The deceased reportedly had underlying ailment and had been buried by his family, even as surveillance unit of the state COVID-19 team had started contact tracing. A statement on Sunday by the Commissioner for Health, Dr Rafiu Isamotu, added that the patient, a returnee from Ibadan, whose spouse was living in Owode-Ede, died on Saturday before the result of his test was announced. He said, “From our findings, the late patient was receiving treatment in Lagos, but when he got to Ibadan, where his mother lives, he was advised to return to Osun for medical help.” “We lost the patient before we could admit him into our medical facility. Out of remaining five cases, the statement said, three of them had contact with an Osun-based Indian national, whose status was confirmed last Friday. The three cases were said to be domestic workers of the Indian national. Meanwhile, the state government on Sunday dismissed claims that Ladoke Akintola Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, was shut after the patient on referral from Lagos, developed symptoms of coronavirus. There were insinuations that the health facility was shut after a patient referred to it from Lagos for eye surgery developed symptoms of coronavirus. Isamotu said, “There was no time LAUTECH Teaching Hospital in Osogbo or any other hospital was shut for fear of COVID-19. Osun has coronavirus treatment and isolation centre at its specialist hospital in Asubiaro in Osogbo.”                                                                               Copyright PUNCH.
