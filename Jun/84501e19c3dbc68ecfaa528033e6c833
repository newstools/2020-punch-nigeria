Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives is meeting with heads of security agencies in Nigeria over the rising insecurity in several parts of the country. They were to appear before the lawmakers in plenary on Tuesday, to explain the attacks by bandits, armed robbers, armed herdsmen, cattle rustlers and kidnappers. The appearance was, however, postponed till Thursday (today). The House had summoned the National Security Adviser, Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno (retd.); Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Gabriel Olonisakin, and other service chiefs; Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu; and Director-General, Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi, over the rising spate of insecurity in Nigeria. The summons was issued based on a motion moved by a member, Mr Sada Soli, over the increasing attacks by bandits in some states in the North-Central and North-East geopolitical zones. Adopting the motion, the House had resolved to “summon the National Security Adviser; the Chief of Defence Staff and Service Chiefs; Director, Department of State Security; and Inspector General of Police to brief the House on the effort being made and the way forward to bring an end to these killings, kidnappings and banditry at the next sitting”. The lawmakers had also mandated the leadership of the House to continue the engagement with all the security agencies “on a monthly basis on the progress being made until normalcy is restored”. The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, at the opening, said, “The honourable members are unhappy because their constituents are unhappy.”
