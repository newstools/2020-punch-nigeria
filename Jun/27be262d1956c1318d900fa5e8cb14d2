Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Sunday congratulated Nigerians as the country becomes wild polio virus-free, while appreciating all partners, local and international, for their relentless efforts in ensuring the clean bill of health. The President, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said the achievement reflected the resilient spirit of Nigerians. He commended men and women in the health sector, who he said drew resources and support from multiple sectors to deal a final blow to the deadly virus. Buhari said, “This achievement is not only one of the great successes of this generation of Nigerians but also one of the obvious dividends of this administration, which is consistent with our progressive investment in the health of our people since 2015. “This landmark achievement is also a promise kept to all Nigerians. As you will recall that in August 2015, barely three months after we assumed office, I promised Nigerians that: ‘My government shall provide the necessary resources and commitment required to strengthen the health system, routine immunization and ensure the country is certified Polio free.’” Copyright PUNCH.
