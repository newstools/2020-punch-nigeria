Peter Dada, Akure A governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress and former chairman of the APC in Ondo State, Mr Isaac Kekemeke, has declared that no other aspirant in the party has the statewide popularity that he has. He expressed confidence in grabbing the ticket of the party at the forthcoming primary of the party based on his popularity. Kekemeke, stated this while speaking with journalists in Akure the state capital. He said other aspirants should step down for him because he is the most popular, the most competent, and the only aspirant present on the ground. Kekemeke said, “Other aspirants should step down for me. I am the most popular. I am the most competent. I am the only one present on the ground. People know me. They should work with me. The governor has done four years, it is now my time after him next year.” On the lingering crisis in the party, the former APC chairman said there was a need for the governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, to lead the move for the resolution of the crisis, not minding his second term ambition. “What we are saying is that the governor has a four years certain tenure and it comes to an end by February and a process for a new tenure begins. “Like he did contest against other people, this seat is open for as many people to contest both at the primary level and at the general election level. He is the Chief Security Officer of this state, he has a duty at all times to make peace. That is his job. “We will work with him to make that peace but that does not mean compromising our individual aspirations. I am going to be governor after Akeredolu,” he declared.
