General Salou Djibo, former head of Nigerâ€™s military junta, will contest the 2020 presidential election after being adopted on Sunday as the candidate for the Peace-Justice-Progress party. He accepted the candidacy at a ceremony before some 5,000 people at the Niamey Sports Palace. Djibo, 55, led the military junta that ousted President Mahamadou Tandja in February 2010, after he tried to stay on in power beyond his two-term limit.
