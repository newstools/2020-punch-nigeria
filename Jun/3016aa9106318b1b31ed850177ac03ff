Peter Dada, Akure Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, says his coronavirus status cannot stop his victory in the forthcoming October 10 governorship election in the state. The governor announced that he tested positive for the virus on Tuesday, saying he has since self-isolate but remained asymptomatic. He said, “Earlier today, I got confirmation of a positive result for Covid-19. I am asymptomatic. I am currently self-isolating and supervised home management will be administered by the wonderful team at our Infectious Disease Hospital. I ask that we all stay safe and be well.” In a video on his Twitter handle, Akeredolu, who is seeking reelection on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, said, “I want to plead with my political associates that they should continue with the project because we are sure to win. My trust in God to get through this is unshakable.” He explained, “I had malaria a few days ago and I was treated and I did get over it. And at the time we had our party NEC, and my colleagues called on me and spoke with one of them who felt that malaria should not be treated lightly that I should go ahead and have a test of COVID -19. “Let me assure our people that as you can see me, there are many of us that don’t have the symptoms. This time, we would conduct another test and we will know the result. Let me assure our people that the work is going on.”
