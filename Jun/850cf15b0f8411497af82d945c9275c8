The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, has inaugurated a committee on the revitalisation of agricultural extension service workers, with a view to enhancing extension services in Nigeria. While inaugurating the committee, the minister said it would work towards achieving the set target of training at least 75,000 extension service providers across the country. He charged the committee to work assiduously to develop an actionable framework that would fast-track the training of extension workers in the next two years. He said there was a need to achieve a more integrated extension advisory service sector, amid the dearth of extension workers in the country. Nanono, in a statement from the ministry, said the committee was expected to draw up workable measures to facilitate the training and retraining of the workers, as well as ensure total transformation of Nigeria’s extension services. He said, “The committee would assist the ministry in developing a workable framework and actionable programme for the training of 75,000 extension workers in collaboration with state agricultural development projects.” According to him, the aim of the programme is to ensure the adoption of better agricultural practices in line with tech services, to improve food requirements and industrial expectations.
