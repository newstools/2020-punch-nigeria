Kayode Oyero The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has said the lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic will produce “great things.” The 78-year-old cleric stated this on Sunday during a sermon broadcast live via the church’s media, DOVE TV. Adeboye, who traced lockdown to the era of biblical characters like Joseph, Elijah, David, John the beloved, and many others, said one of the “great things” that would come out of the lockdown “is an increase in birth rate” all over the world. He said, “A lot of great things are going to come out of this lockdown. Let me advise those of you who are pastors – you are resting now; I am busy. Get ready because early next year, you’ll be having a lot of naming ceremonies. You’ll be going from house to house naming newborn babies as a result of the lockdown.” He noted that the rate of coronavirus recoveries across the globe was “amazing”. Copyright PUNCH.
