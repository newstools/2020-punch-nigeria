So, without justice there will be no peace, so I am ready to do justice to every APC member. “NEC is the highest organ of the party except for the convention, and NEC can function for convention in-between, so any decision taken by NEC is the final decision. NEC has directed that every member in court should withdraw his suit. “(The) party will carry all members along especially the leaders of the APC. Many of them have paid their dues. So, we will carry them along.”
