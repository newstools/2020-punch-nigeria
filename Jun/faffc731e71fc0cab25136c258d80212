Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Ekiti State Commissioner for Information, Muyiwa Olumilua, said on Friday that the State Executive Council had approved alternative financial instrument to help speed up payment of over N13.5bn in unpaid gratuities and N2.7bn in outstanding pensions. Olumilua said, “The council’s approval of the voluntary alternative payment instrument is premised on Governor Kayode Fayemi’s conviction that every worker is worthy of their wages during their life time.” The commissioner said the EXCO at its virtual meeting on Thursday considered and approved the memorandum presented by the Special Adviser, Investments, Trade and Innovations, Akin Oyebode, proposing the alternative financial instrument, which he said would not be loan facility, to address the pension issues. He said, “Council noted that in spite of the government increasing gratuity payments by 900 per cent from 10m paid by the previous administration to N100m monthly, the possibility of some of the retirees receiving their gratuities during their lifetime seemed very remote.” According to Olumilua, there is therefore “the need to explore other viable options to reduce the waiting time for the retirees and pay up as much as 50 per cent of the outstanding on or before the end of this administration in 2022.” The Nigeria Union of Pensioners Chairman in Ekiti State, Elder Ayo Kumapayi, who lauded the government resolution, said it would go a long way in addressing the issues of pensions and gratuities in the state.
