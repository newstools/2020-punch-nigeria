Toni Ufoh Victor Moses and five other Chelsea players have been told they have no future at the club, according to The Sun. Tiemoue Bakayoko, Emerson Palmieri, Davide Zappacosta, Danny Drinkwater and Michy Batshuayi are the other players told that they do not feature in Lampard’s future plans. The report claims the Blues will have to accept a major hit on all six of the surplus stars just to get them off the wage bill. Moses, who is currently on loan at Inter Milan, could leave this summer as the Italians have an option to sign the 29-year-old wing-back for £10m, but the Nerrazuri are not prepared to pay that amount during the coronavirus recession. They could complete a deal for half of that price and Chelsea are unlikely to stand in the way of his departure. The Nigerian, who joined the Blues in 2012, had previously been shipped out on loan to Liverpool, Stoke City, West Ham and Fenerbahce. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
