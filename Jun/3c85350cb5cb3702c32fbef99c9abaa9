Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi The Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency has debunked media reports credited to its Executive Chairman, Dr Rilwan Mohammed, that over 200 have died in the state from activities of quack medical officials. The denial is contained in a media statement signed by the information officer of the agency, Ibrahim Sani, on Sunday. The statement noted that the reports had “recklessly and wrongly” quoted the Executive Chairman of the Agency during a roundtable media parley discussion, organised by the Bauchi State Network for Public Health Reporters. The statement read, “Dr Mohammed was emphasizing on the importance of childbirth spacing which he said if properly applied would reduce the number of mysterious deaths in women by 200 per cent and avoid the risk of illegal abortions caused by unqualified medical personnel at the expense of getting quick money. “The Executive Chairman did not attack any community or mentioned any part of the state as being prevalent with highest cases of unwanted pregnancies as the media reported. “Rather, he hinted about the lack of education and awareness from the women of reproductive ages who, after they become pregnant tend to visit quack health workers seeking for the termination of the pregnancies,” Sani stated. The agency’s spokesman added, “Dr Mohammed was deeply amazed by some media reports. We therefore debunk in totality such reports, the attitudes of some print media who are bent on writing negative and other derogatory matters.” Copyright PUNCH.
