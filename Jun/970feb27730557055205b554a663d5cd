BUA Group’s acquisition of majority shareholding in PW Nigeria Limited will help boost Nigeria’s mining sector, the Mining Director, PW Nigeria, Chris McQuillan, has said. McQuillan, who spoke ahead of the Nigeria Mining Week scheduled to hold in Abuja, said PWN had provided full-spectrum services to investors and executed private and public projects for well-known companies over the years across Nigeria and the sub-region. He said BUA’s acquisition of majority shares in PWN would promote mining opportunities for the Nigerian economy through turn-key mining solutions, executed to world-class standards. McQuillan said, “It is difficult not to get excited by the opportunities that exist in Nigeria’s mining sector which remains largely untapped. We recently spent some time in the British geological survey going through mining records for the region that dates back to the early 1900s. “A lot of enthusiasm existed during this period; we want to reignite this enthusiasm and bring the sector back to life.
