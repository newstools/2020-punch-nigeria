Olushola Odeyinde Six-year-old alcoholic monkey has been sentenced to life imprisonment for aggressive behaviour that began when he stopped getting liquor. The drunk monkey identified as Kalua left one man dead and 250 injured after going on the rampage when his liquor supply dried up in India. Zookeepers at Kanpur Zoological Park charged with re-assimilating the primate for the last three years have deemed him too dangerous to live among his kind, and have sentenced him to solitary confinement for the rest of his life.

After his owner died, the animal stopped getting his supply of alcohol and began prowling the streets in a furious rage. It targeted women and girls in particular, with dozens of children left needing plastic surgery after he ripped open their faces with his fangs. The animal has since been caught and will now be kept in captivity for the rest of its life. “We kept him in isolation for some months and then shifted him to a separate cage,” said the zoo doctor Mohd Nasir. “There has been no change in his behaviour and he remains as aggressive as he was. It has been three years since he was brought here, but now it has been decided that he will remain in captivity all his life.” Zoologists also discovered that he was not only an alcoholic but that he refused to eat vegetables.
