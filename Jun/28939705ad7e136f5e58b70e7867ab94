Sola Shittu, Benin The Federal High Court in Benin, on Monday, adjourned further hearing in a suit seeking to bar the National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress from using the direct primary to select its standard bearer for the 2020 governorship poll. The party’s primary is scheduled to hold on June 22. Presiding judge, Justice Mohammed Umar, ordered parties to the suit to file all relevant papers and exchange the same within two days. Edo State APC Deputy Chairman, Pastor Kenneth Asemokhai, and one of the party’s governorship aspirants, Matthew Iduoriyekemwen, who are plaintiffs in the suit, had asked the court to restrain the APC from adopting the direct mode of primary, citing COVID-19 and 2018 APC National Executive Council resolution as grounds for their action. Counsel for the plaintiffs, Ken Mozia, (SAN) and John Odubela (SAN), argued that state chapters were given the liberty to choose the mode of primaries and forward the same to the NWC, subsequently their clients choose the indirect primary in which 4,000 delegates would participate with 500 delegates representing each ward. However, counsel for the defendants led by H. O Ogbodu (SAN), disagreed with the submission of the plaintiffs. This prompted Justice Umar to order the defendants two days within which to file their papers to show cause why an order of injunction earlier requested by the plaintiffs should not be granted. The Independent National Electoral Commission and the National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole, were also joined as parties to the suit. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
