Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has said that the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management did not allocate N-Power recruitment slots to him. An online medium (not The PUNCH) had published that some lawmakers printed out application forms from the portal of the N-Power scheme which is expected to be shared to the beneficiaries of the slots allocated to them. But Lawan, in a statement on Saturday by his Special Adviser on Media, Ola Awoniyi, said the publication which linked him to the claim was untrue. The statement read in part, “We hereby advise members of the public to totally disregard the fake and malicious publication in its entirety as regards the Senate President. “It should be noted that the fairytale only claimed that some lawmakers printed out application forms from the portal of the scheme but failed to provide any evidence that this was to fill its speculated allocated slots. “We wish to stress that neither the Senate President nor this office has anything to do with the purported slots credited by the publication to the Senate President.” The ministry opened the N-Power portal last night for registration by new applicants.
