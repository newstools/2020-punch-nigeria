Ebenezer Bajela Austin Okocha’s brilliant individual strike against legendary German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn during the 1992/93 season has been described as the most spectacular goal in the history of the league by Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp. Okocha, who played for Eintracht Frankfurt then, came sensationally dribbled past Kahn, in goal for Karlsruher, and a couple of defenders, before slotting home. Giving reasons why top European clubs go all out to sign African players, Klopp sighted the Nigerian’s goal as a key factor that contributed to that, describing the goal against Khan as one of the greatest in the league. “He scored the most spectacular goal in the history of German football,” the Liverpool manager told The Guardian. “It took like five minutes of Kahn and his defenders diving on the floor before he put the ball in the net! “Some of the world’s best players have been from Africa. George Weah, Didier Drogba, Yaya Touré. In their generation they were some of the best players so why should we not sign them? It’s great.” Over two decades after, Kahn, who went on to feature for Bayern Munich, as well as winning the 1996 Euros and the 2005 Confederations Cup and reaching the 2002 World Cup final with Germany, conceded that the goal still left him “feeling dizzy.” The goal was voted the 1993 Goal of The Year by viewers of Sportschau, an ARD German TV sports programme.
