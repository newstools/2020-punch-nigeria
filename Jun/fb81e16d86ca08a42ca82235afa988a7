Presco, a palm-oil processing firm listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, recently signed a partnership deal with the Edo State Government to develop high-yielding oil palm seeds in the state. The project is part of the Edo State Oil Palm Programme. The firm said the deal would enable it to develop smallholder oil palm farms using technology. Presco said it planned to create a special company in Nigeria for the propagation and distribution of high-yielding planting materials. It said Edo State was regarded as a first choice location because of its ease of doing business as well as friendly government policies and hospitality in the state.
