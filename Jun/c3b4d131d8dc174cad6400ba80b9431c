Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa A leader of the Ijaw nation, Edwin Clark, has backed former governor Seriake Dickson’s bid to contest the vacant Bayelsa West Senatorial District. Clark said Bayelsa, and indeed the Ijaw nation, were seriously in need of “men of demonstrable character, courage, capacity and knowledge like Dickson” to run for Senate. In a statement on Sunday, the media advisor to the former governor, Mr Fidelis Soriwei, quoted the elder statesman as calling on Ijaw leaders to support Dickson “in the collective interest of the Ijaw nation and the Niger Delta.” Clark was quoted as saying, “As a former member of the House of Representatives, he (the former governor) has hands-on experience on legislative procedures and workings, the leadership acumen to wade through murky waters of parliamentary democracy and gymnastics. “Dickson has been a leading voice in the call for restructuring of this country. He makes no pretention about it.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
