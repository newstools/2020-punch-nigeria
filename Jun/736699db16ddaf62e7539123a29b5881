Peter David A socio-cultural organisation, Ogbakha-Edo, has raised the alarm over an alleged influx of Fulani herdsmen in Benin forest. The group said the influx of the herdsmen and groups of young men from the northern region was a threat to the Benin Kingdom. Secretary-General of Ogbakha-Edo, Dr Andrew Izekor, in a press conference on Friday, said the development was worrisome because it seemed like a well-coordinated deployment. He said, “Ogbakha-Edo has in recent weeks observed with concern the sudden influx of hundreds, if not thousands of young able-bodied jobless men ostensibly of the Hausa/Fulani tribe into the Benin Kingdom, nay Edo South. “As we speak, there are reports of the Fulani herdsmen converting forest reserves and farmlands in Ovia and Orhionmwon, from where they are said to launch alleged criminal attacks on unsuspecting farmers and travellers. “Of note is the occupation of the Odighi forest where an unconfirmed report has it that there are over 2000 Fulani herdsmen who have forcefully occupied a vast expanse of the forest as their habitation and fortress. “Apart from eye witness reports, the social media has been awash with videos of these young men either being offloaded in their hundreds from long haulage trucks or streaming in a dreadful surge in the streets of Benin City.” Copyright PUNCH.
