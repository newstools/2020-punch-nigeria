Johnson Okafor Tantalizers Plc has reported a loss after tax of N65.08m for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020, down from the N80.89m loss posted in the same period a year ago. The company’s revenue dropped by 5.56 per cent to N290.60m in Q1 2020 from N307.71m in Q1 2019, while its cost of sales fell to N161.06m from N194.29m. Tantalizers had returned to profitability in 2017 but slipped back to a loss position in the first quarter 2018, a development market analysts attributed to weak consumer demand, stiffer competition and increased financing cost. Tantalizers had revealed that it had commenced corporate restructuring of its existing debts and cost structure while looking to raise equity. It expressed business optimism regarding the efficiency of its strategic initiatives aimed at reversing the recent decline in profitability. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
