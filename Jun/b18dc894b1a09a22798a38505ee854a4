Chima Azubuike, Gombe The Gombe State Commissioner for Finance, Muhammad Magaji, has said the state lost 20 per cent of its Internally Generated Revenue within the last two months. Magaji said this in an interview with our correspondent in Gombe on Sunday. He added that the COVID-19 pandemic had affected lives and the economy of Gombe State, as well as the country at large. Majagi said, “The pandemic has affected businesses; what this means is that whatever revenue we would have generated had gone down considerably. “January 2019 wasn’t affected by the pandemic, the state generated over N400m in revenue. In February we generated a little above N300m. “Substantially, that has been our figures in the last two to three months. Revenue has been dwindling between N280m to N300m. “However, from September 2019, we had a good average of N350m to N400m; that tells you that there is a percentage reduction of about 15 and 20 per cent.” Copyright PUNCH.
