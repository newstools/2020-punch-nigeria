Harry Kane was among four players who returned to the Tottenham side for a friendly against Norwich – but they lost 2-1 to the Premier League’s basement club. Kane was injured when the season was suspended due to coronavirus as well as Moussa Sissoko, Heung-Min Son and Steven Bergwijn – but they all played in the defeat at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Kane has been out since New Year’s Day and was sorely missed as Spurs’ form nosedived before the pandemic, dropping seven points below fourth-placed Chelsea and four behind Manchester United, who they face on June 19 on their Premier League return, Sky Sports reports. In a game divided into four quarters of 30 minutes, Erik Lamela took the lead for Tottenham with a diving header, having been setup by Bergwijn. Kane also hit the crossbar early on and Serge Aurier also had chance. Dele Alli – suspended for the United game due his coronavirus social media post – came on with several others at half-time but Norwich struck twice late on through Josip Drmic and Mario Vrancic to boost their momentum as they look to avoid relegation in the run-in. The Canaries are six points adrift of 17th-placed Watford and begin their quest for survival with a clash against fellow strugglers Southampton at Carrow Road next Friday.
