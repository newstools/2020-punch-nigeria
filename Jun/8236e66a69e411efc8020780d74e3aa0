Chukwudi Akasike THE Rivers State Government is to commence the construction of a fourth flyover at GRA Junction, Port Harcourt. The state government added that the Rumuola flyover would be expanded to accommodate additional vehicular traffic. State Governor, Nyesom Wike, said the new projects would complement Rebisi, Rumuogba and Okoro-nu-Odo flyover projects, which he said, had reached advanced stages of completion. Wike disclosed this while briefing newsmen on Wednesday after inspecting projects executed by Julius Berger Nigeria Plc in Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor Local Government Areas of the state. He said, “The decision to embark on these projects, even at a time the state government is fighting COVID-19, is because people will still need basic infrastructure to improve their lives after the pandemic.” He expressed satisfaction with the level of work done at the various projects sites in the state and said the projects would be delivered as scheduled. The governor said his administration would invest in building standard hospitals to discourage medical tourism. The Managing Director, Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, Dr Lars Richter, assured Wike that the company would deliver the three flyovers as promised during the signing of the contract. Copyright PUNCH.
