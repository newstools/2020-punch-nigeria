Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, on Thursday, paraded a suspected supplier of aphrodisiac to Boko Haram members in Borno State. The suspect, Bakura Ibrahim, apart from supplying the sex enhancing herbs, to the insurgents, also provides fuel and bags of fishing hooks and net. Parading the suspect in Maiduguri, the NSCDC Commandant in the state, Mr Ibrahim Abdullahi, said, “On June 9, 2020, around 10am, at the Muna Garage along the Gamboru Ngala Road, a 35-year-old driver, Bukar Ibrahim, was arrested with an ash Peugeot 504 with number plate JJN770BZ concealed with 24 jerry cans  of 25 litres each of Premium Motor Spirit. “Other items found with him are seven cartons of traditional medicine, 10 bags of fishing hooks and nets, one packet of herbal medicine and 25 packets of fishing nets and sex enhancing herbs suspected to be supplied to Boko Haram terrorists.” Abdullahi said the move against the logistics suppliers of Boko Haram became imperative in order to curtail rising attacks in Borno State. On Tuesday, the insurgents attacked a Borno village, killing 81 persons. Abdullahi said it had become necessary to cut off the economic base of the insurgents following the recent upsurge in attacks on some Borno communities. He said the NSCDC would not relent until all the logistics suppliers were apprehended and the supply chain to the insurgents cut off. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
