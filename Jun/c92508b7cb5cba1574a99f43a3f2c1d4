Dayo Ojerinde The Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria has urged the federal and state governments to protect pharmacists and secure pharmaceutical facilities in the country. According to a statement signed by the ACPN National Chairman, Mr Sam Adekola, and National Secretary, Bose Idowu, the killing of community pharmacists on essential duty has become a recurring phenomenon in the last few years. The statement read in part, “In view of the reality that criminal elements assume that community pharmacists and other health facilities are perceived as gold mines, an urgent need arises for President Muhammadu Buhari and the 36 state governors to direct the Inspector- General of Police and the Commissioners of Police in all the states to set up special security and police squads to ensure more rigorous surveillance of pharmacies and other health facilities in the ultimate public interest. “If this call is unheeded, government at all levels may risk a gradual withdrawal of pharmacists and other relevant personnel from the frontline duties of ensuring the wellness, vitality and good health of the nation. “With utmost respect to the president and all other apparatus of state security, this is a minimum demand from the government to reassure pharmacists and other health workers that the government does not take our safety for granted.” Copyright PUNCH.
