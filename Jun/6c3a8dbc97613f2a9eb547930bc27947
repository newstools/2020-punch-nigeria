Ebenezer Bajela Ex-Eagles midfielder, Garba Lawal, has disagreed with French club Lille over the €60m price tag placed on Victor Osimhen ahead of a possible transfer in the summer. Osimhen, one of the hottest transfer prospects, is almost certain that he won’t stay at Lille following his impressive performance in the French Ligue 1 last season. Despite Les Dogues dropping their asking price for the Nigeria international from an initial €90m to €60m, Lawal believes that the talented forward is overpriced. “Lille are asking for €60m because they saw the calibre of clubs asking to sign Osimhen,” Lawal told The PUNCH. “They wouldn’t have asked for such amount if it was an average team that was willing to sign him because there is no way they could afford it. “Take for instance, if it was Aston Villa that was looking for him, would they have placed the €60m price tag on him? “Lille are very smart, they saw that big clubs in Europe are the ones looking to sign Osimhen and they believe that they can make money from the deal. They see it as their chance to cash in on him, considering the amount they signed him from Charleroi. “For a player that they signed for €12m and he spent just a season and they are asking for €60m, I think it’s crazy. “I think a fee within the region of €30m would be nice and allow the young man to move on with his career. We want to see him make that big move, which is good for him as a player.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
