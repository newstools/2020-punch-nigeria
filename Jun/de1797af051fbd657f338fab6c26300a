Peter Dada, Akure The rift between the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, and his deputy, Agboola Ajayi, continue to fester as the latter accused the governor of planning to remove him illegally through the state House of Assembly. Ajayi, who dumped the All Progressives Congress on Sunday and joined the Peoples Democratic Party, alleged that the governor was planning to induce members of the Assembly to remove him from office. In a statement issued on Tuesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Tope Okeowo, the embattled deputy governor reiterated that he had not violated any part of the constitution, with his defection. He said, ” We wish to state that the deputy governor is a tested politician of note, who is not unprepared for this type of kangaroo and infamous move from the desperate and drowning governor and his group. “By joining PDP, Agboola Ajayi has not committed any impeachable offence. He has only exercised his constitutional right of freedom of association. Section 40 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).

It becomes more laughable when such comes from someone who had boasted about having majority members in the Assembly. “Clearly, while Governor Akeredolu does not believe in the inducement, it is left for our very reputable legislative arm to either confirm or debunk this spurious allegation” Ojogo said.
