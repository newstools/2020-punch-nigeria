Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The Kaduna State House of Assembly on Thursday impeached Mukhtar Isa Hazo, representing Milgoma constituency and in his place elected Isaac Auta, from Kauru. Hazo was until his election, the House Committee Chairman on Local Government and Chieftain Affairs before his election as Deputy Speaker in February, 2020. The 24-member Assembly passed a vote of no confidence in Hazo. There was, however, a mild drama during the inauguration of the new deputy speaker when a member attempted to snatch the maze, the symbol of authority of the House, which led to exchange of blows among lawmakers. The attempt was foiled by other lawmakers and the Clerk of the Assembly promptly administered the oath of office on Auta. Another member, Liman Dahiru, representing Makera constituency, made a second attempt to seize the maze after the inauguration, but his efforts were equally thwarted by the Sergeant at Arms and other chamber staff and lawmakers.
