Friday Olokor, Abuja The Independent National Electoral Commission on Wednesday said despite the threat of COVID-19, postponing all scheduled 2020 elections would throw Nigeria into avoidable constitutional crisis. The INEC also said accreditation of journalists to cover the governorship elections in Ondo and Edo states as well as the bye-elections would be done online. The PUNCH reports that apart from the Edo and Ondo states governorship elections scheduled for September 19 and October 10 2020, the commission would be conducting 10 bye-elections, including the five senatorial and four state Asssembly bye-elections spread across nine States of the federation. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman of its Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said this in his speech on the modalities for Voter Education and Publicity activities during a virtual meeting with the media in Abuja. According to him, sometimes, unexpected situations, events and circumstances throw countries and nations off balance and present them with new situations and challenges that seem insurmountable. Okoye said, “In such circumstances and situations, some countries and nations may buckle, throw in the towel in defeat and are completely overwhelmed. Sometimes, such situations throw up new players and spur creativity and innovation that accelerates development. “Our nation Nigeria is faced with and in the valley of this dilemma. Giving up is not an option and buckling on account of challenges is also not an option.” “Throwing in the towel in our constitutional circumstances may do violence to the constitution and wittingly or unwittingly throw the country into avoidable constitutional crisis.” Copyright PUNCH.
