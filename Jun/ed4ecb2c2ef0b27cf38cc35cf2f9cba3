Umar Muhammed, Lafia The Nasarawa State House of Assembly has asked Governor Abdullahi Sule to relieve the Secretary to the State Government, Mr. Aliyu Ahmed-Tijani, of his appointment. The lawmakers said the SSG should be sacked over his alleged failure to account for N284. 5m school projects fund when he was a Commissioner for Education during the tenure of the immediate past governor, Umaru Tanko Al-Makura, in the state. The Speaker of the House, Mr. Ibrahim Abdullahi, gave the directive on Tuesday in Lafia shortly after the house deliberated on the report of an ad-hoc committee investigating the alleged N1 billion released in 2018 for the renovation/fencing of Secondary schools across the 13 Local Government Areas of the state.
