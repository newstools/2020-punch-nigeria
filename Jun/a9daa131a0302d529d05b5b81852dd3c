Nike Popoola The Lagos State Government has said intending developers can obtain planning information free of charge through the Physical Planning Department of the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development. A statement from the Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Mukaila Sanusi, said the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako, disclosed this during the presentation of progress report on the Lagos State Electronic Physical Planning System being developed by the ministry. Salako said planning information was important in guiding developers on the assigned use of sites intended for building construction. “Planning information gives information on land use and helps reduce infractions in the built environment,” he said. He added that Lagos State Government had always sustained the rendering of planning information as a social service. He urged Lagosians to always avail themselves of the service as a prerequisite for determining whether to go ahead or not with a physical development plan in relation to a given site. Salako said by making the service within the reach of Lagosians, the state had consistently improved its ease of doing business rating, while contributing to the achievement of the THEMES agenda of government, particularly the ‘Making Lagos a 21st-century economy pillar’. “In view of its importance, planning information is being considered as an integral part of the ongoing efforts to adopt electronic physical planning system in the state” he added.
