John Alechenu, Abuja The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki has expressed fears that he may not get justice since the National Chairman of All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole was the “judge” in the case. He said this while speaking to journalists soon after undergoing two hours of screening at the party’s headquarters, in Abuja on Wednesday. He said; “The last time I came here, I asked that Oshiomhole recuse himself from the process in the interest of peace and justice. But as a party man, I have had to go through the screening like everybody else. “Since he is the judge and the jury in this matter, I will just wait for the outcome of the screening. I have given them all the information they need; the controversial certificate from the University of Ibadan has been tendered. “Like I said, as a party man I had to go through the screening process but I do not believe that I will get justice because Comrade Adams Oshiomhole is an interested party in the Edo process. “One of the questions asked was why did I issue a gazette that will prevent the party from performing direct elections in Edo. “That did I not see it as an anti-party activity? I just felt that if we put politics above the lives of the people of Edo State, we may be missing the point”.
