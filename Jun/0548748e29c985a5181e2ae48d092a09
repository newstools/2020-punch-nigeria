Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Clerk of the Senate, Mr. Nelson Ayewoh, has denied knowledge of a letter purportedly written by him, which seeks the probe of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio. Ayewoh, according to the letter, which found its way to the social media on Sunday, allegedly wrote the letter on the instruction of the Deputy President of the Senate,  Ovie Omo-Agege But Ayewoh, in a statement on Wednesday, but dated Tuesday , June 9, 2020, said neither the letter nor the  letterhead was genuine. He said the wordings, style and syntax used in the letter “are clearly different from our in- house style.” The statement read, “The letter fraudulently indicates that His Excellency, the Deputy President of the Senate directed the Clerk of the Senate to petition the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs and one Mr Scott Ikott Tommey on allegations bordering on alleged corruption at the Niger Delta Development Commission. “The Office of the Deputy President of the Senate has already responded to the false publication and fraudulent petition. “I completely agree with the submission of the Deputy President of the Senate that the publication is ‘false, fake, malicious, mischievous and vexatious.’ Copyright PUNCH.
