Peter David, Benin Vice-Chancellor of the Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Edo State, Prof Ignatius Onimawo, on Tuesday refuted an online media report that allegedly quoted him as saying that the University of Ibadan certificate of Governor Godwin Obaseki was fake. Briefing the press at the main campus of the university in Ekpoma, the Vice-Chancellor described the news which was published in an online medium (not The PUNCH) as “wicked, malicious, and outright falsehood”. He asserted that he did not at any time grant interview to any journalist on the issue, and has never during interpersonal interaction made such comments to anybody. Onimawo said, “We have started an investigation into the publication, and the matter has been reported to the DSS (Department of State Service), police, and we have also reported the matter to other agencies of government to find out the root of the matter. “It took me by surprise that somebody could quote the Vice-Chancellor of AAU as saying that the certificate of the visitor to the university is fake. The executive governor, His Excellency, Governor Godwin Obaseki is distinguished Alumnus of the University of Ibadan. “In fact, in 2018 the University of Ibadan Alumni Association chose him as the distinguished Alumni lecturer, and I accompanied him to Ibadan to that event. So, how can I turn around to say that the same governor was now asking me to make him belong to the alumni association?” he queried.
