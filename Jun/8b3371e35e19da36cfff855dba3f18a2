Ada Wodu, Calabar Civil servants in Cross Rivers State have said there is no going back on their plan to commence an industrial action on Monday (today). The Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress in Cross River, Benedict Ukpepi, said the strike would go on as scheduled as government had yet to meet the labour union. The NLC chair accused the state government of showing no interest in the welfare of workers. He said, “It is very obvious that Cross River State is not interested in the welfare of her workers. Workers’ issues presented to government have been ignored. Even some issues that organised labour have reached agreement on have all been abandoned and rejected by the government. “Be informed that some of our workers whose names were unjustly removed from the payroll have died. We have lost about five members and we can no longer keep mum, enough is enough. Ukpepi said 45 affiliate unions would take part in the strike action. The Trade Union Congress and some affiliate unions have, however, backed out of the strike. The TUC secretary in the state, Ken Bassey, said with the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of the strike was wrong. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
