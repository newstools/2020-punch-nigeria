Kayode Oyero Embattled Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, announced on Wednesday that he has not moved to a new party yet. The governor, who made this known via his Twitter handle, said his priority at the moment is to curb the spread of the life-threatening coronavirus disease. He wrote, “I have not moved to a new platform yet to seek re-election. My focus now is to control the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, which is ravaging our country and threatening our healthcare system. Stay safe.” The PUNCH had reported that Obaseki dumped the All Progressives Congress following his disqualification from the June 22 governorship primary in the state. He announced the decision to State House correspondents after a meeting at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Tuesday. The governor said he would pursue his ambition for second term in office on another platform.
