Joseph Olaoluwa The International Monetary Fund has pledged to support governments in adpoting measures to fight corruption. It vowed to do so by publishing procurement contracts, commissioning independent audits and stepping up anti-money laundering measures. Speaking in an interview with Transparency International, Managing Director of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, described corruption as a debilitating force that targets the poor in the economy. She said, “Corruption is a corrosive force that hits the poor and the most vulnerable people the hardest and it is tragic when government action is needed to save lives and protect livelihoods but money is squandered rather than deployed for what is their priority. “And this is why the IMF will continue to support governments in their efforts to adopt a range of measures from publishing procurement contracts online, to commissioning independent audits to improve transparency and public financial management to set up anti-corruption and anti-money laundering measures.” The IMF boss examined the role civil soceities play in curbing corruption and lauded them for their work.
