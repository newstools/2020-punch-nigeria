Johnny Edward Super Eagles head coach Gernot Rohr has hinted that Victor Osimhen has an opportunity to move to one of Europe’s top teams, but has cautioned the Lille striker not to play second fiddle if he does move in the summer. Osimhen, who scored 18 goals in his debut campaign in Ligue 1, has attracted interests from Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United. Clubs in Spain and Italy are also interested in the 21-year-old, who joined Lille last summer from Belgian Pro League club Sporting Charleroi for around £12m. “Victor Osimhen will have a very big opportunity to go to a very big club in the Premier League or Italy,” Rohr said in an interview on Channels Television. “This is a success for him and for the Super Eagles but if he is not playing, it won’t be good for him as a young player because a young player has to be playing to progress. “If we have players playing at the high-level clubs, our level in the Super Eagles will also grow.” Copyright PUNCH.
