Kelvin Ekerete Nigeria Boxing Federation head coach, Anthony Konyegwachie, has decried the poor state of the Brai Ayanote boxing gymnasium at the National Stadium, Lagos. The gymnasium is the training place for the country’s boxing team but has been in shambles for several years due to neglect. Konyegwachi, Nigeria’s coach to the 2014 and 2018 Commonwealth Games and the 2016 Olympics in Brazil, says the gym is not worthy place to train national team boxers. “That place (Brai Ayanote gymnasium) is just like a local club gym. Most of the training we do there is improvised, based on the exposure I have,” he told The PUNCH. “That place is not fit to be called a national gym. We don’t have anything there. The only things we have there are the punching bags and the ring, nothing else.” Konyegwachie, who represented Nigeria at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, is called on the government to intervene and help clean up the stadium. “I hope the government can help us by refurbishing it and making it up to date with the latest equipment.” Copyright PUNCH.
