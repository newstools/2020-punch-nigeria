James Abraham, Jos The Plateau State Police Command, on Tuesday, said the search to free the father of the former Governor of the state, Pa Defwan Dariye is ongoing. The PUNCH had reported that Pa Dariye, said to be over 90 years, was abducted by gunmen who attacked his residence in Mushere Community, Bokkos Local Government Area of the state last Thursday. A spokesman for the Plateau State Police Command, Mr Ubah Ogaba, said, “No, We have not seen him. But our men and officers who were deployed immediately after his abduction are still searching for him.” However, a source close to the former Governor, Joshua Dariye, told The PUNCH that the kidnappers had made contact with the family members and demanded N100 million ransom. The source said, ” The former Governor is not happy about the kidnap of his father for the second time.  They (kidnappers)  have made contact with the family and they are demanding the sum of N100 million as a ransom”.
