Enyioha Opara, Minna The Niger State Police Command has apprehended one of the suspects involved in the killing of the Divisional Crime Officer, Kpakungu Police Division, DSP Aaron Sunday, three years after. The suspect, Musa Usman, aka Musa Kaura, of the Maitumbi area, Minna, was trailed and arrested by detectives attached to the Maitumbi Division following a tip-off. It was learnt that the suspect was one of the hoodlums, who hacked the DCO to death on March, 3, 2017, and fled to Kaduna State. PUNCH Metro gathered that the gang had been terrorising residents of Minna before killing the police officer. Usman told our correspondent that he never knew that police operatives were still trailing him after three years of participating in Sunday’s killing. He stated, “I never knew that the police would get at me; I thought they had forgotten about the case, not knowing that my cup would be full one day and I would be arrested after three years. “I have learnt my lesson in a hard way and I advice young men to always stay out of trouble and be useful to themselves, because living rough will not help anybody; rather, it will ruin your life forever.” The command’s spokesman, Wasiu Abiodun, confirmed the arrest, saying Usman was one of those who murdered the DCO three years ago. “There is no hiding place for evildoers; the hoodlum (Usman) never knew that one day, the police would arrest him for the offence he committed years back. This will serve as a deterrent to others, who may think that they will get away with evil,” Abiodun said. Copyright PUNCH.
