Nike Popoola AXA Mansard, a member of the AXA Group, has said it plans to deepen insurance and pension penetration while improving the investment culture in the country by driving its USSD code usage as an alternative channel for service consumption. A statement from the firm said the USSD code was designed to give users a more convenient way to purchase and manage their AXA Mansard product plans. It said users would have an easy, quick and convenient channel to buy new products and policies, renew existing policies and make payments for value-added services. The company said the USSD code was intended to improve customer experience and reduce turnaround time for all transactions. The Chief Digital Officer at AXA Mansard, Mr Bayo Adesanya, said, “The digital world is advancing at a very fast pace. “Organisations thus need to match the pace of this dynamic world by designing initiatives and creating platforms that allow their consumers to remain at the cutting edge of global digital transformation.” According to the statement, the USSD code also enables subscribers to perform various activities, which include purchase airtime, payment of utility bills, account opening and account balance check. “With the USSD code, all the encumbrances associated with premium remittance, liquidation requests and account monitoring have been resolved, giving our clients an exceptional experience at any touchpoint of our services,” Adesanya added. The Chief Executive Officer, AXA Mansard Investments, Mr Deji Tunde-Anjous, said, “The world is rapidly accepting the realities of a remote lifestyle, and the onus is on every service provider to ensure customers’ needs are met.
