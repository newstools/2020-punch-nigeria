James Abraham, Jos Plateau State House of Assembly on Tuesday suspended the Chairmen of Qua’an Pan Local Government Area, Isaac Kwallu, and his counterpart in Kanam, Wakdung Abbas. The two council chairmen were suspended by the lawmakers during their plenary at the Assembly complex in Plateau, the state capital. The Speaker of the House, Ayuba Abok, said the two council chairmen were suspended for disregarding the order of the state legislature adding that their suspension will last for three months Abok directed the affected chairmen to hand over to their deputies in their respective councils. He said, “The State Assembly had directed the Local Government Chairmen to recall the councillors of various wards which they earlier suspended in the two Local Government Areas and to pay them their entitlements but the Chairmen in question refused. “We have no choice than to suspend the two Chairmen although, the Chairman of Quan-Pan complied, it wasn’t convincing.” The Chairman House Committee on Information and member representing Pankshin North, Philip Dasun, who also briefed journalists after the plenary justified the action of the lawmakers saying that the House needed to wade into the matter to ensure peace. He noted that the House has the constitutional power to sanction the two council Chairmen and insisted that the Council Chairmen disobeyed the directive of the House.
