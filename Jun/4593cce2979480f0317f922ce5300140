Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, says Thursday that the crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress is a show of God’s anger on the ruling party. Fayose said the crisis was a price for the role the APC played in impoverishing Nigerians, adding that things would get worse for the party. The former governor in a statement by his media aide, Lere Olayinka, said the APC had been treating Nigerians with contempt. The statement read in part, “For Nigeria to return to the path of progress that it was before the APC took over power, more confusion will have to hit the party till it goes into oblivion. “Definitely, their matters will be made worse with time because for Nigeria and its people to return to the path of peace and progress, the APC house of lies that is being nurtured with the blood of Nigerians must collapse.” READ ALSO: Your best not good enough, Buhari tells security chiefs Fayose, who lamented the killings by bandits in the Northern part of the country especially in Katsina, Kaduna, Zamfara and Sokoto States, said, “God will never be happy with a party that its government is doing nothing to stop the bloodshed, rape, and destruction of people’s sources of livelihood ongoing in the country. “It is on record that more than 300 Nigerians have been brutally murdered by bandits in the last three weeks and the APC government has done nothing. Rather, Nigerians who raised concerns are being insulted by the APC government while those who protested are being arrested and detained.
