FC Tulsa head coach, Michael Nsien, has backed Nigerian trio Mfon Udoh, Solomon Kwambe and Raphael Ayagwa to succeed in the US second-tier United Soccer League Championship. The former Nigeria Professional Football League stars joined Tulsa earlier in the year. Nsien said, “The players I brought have caps with the Nigerian national team. “Udoh is a goal scorer; he’s shown that quality consistently. Solomon has been rock steady since he’s been a professional player. “Ayagwa is a young player with a lot of quality and experience already.” On how the players have adapted to football in the US, Nsien added, “It’s never easy adapting to a new country and league. With the break in play due to the pandemic, it has given the players enough time to adjust and get their footing.” The Nigerian-American coach was a standout defender at the University of Dayton, where he studied Communication Management and played in Major League Soccer sides LA Galaxy and Portland Timbers before completing his coaching badges.
