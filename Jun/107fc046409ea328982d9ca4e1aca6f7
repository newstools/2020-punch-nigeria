Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, on Sunday met with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on the increasing security challenges in the country and made a case for drastic solutions. Lawan told State House correspondents after the meeting that he believed in providing more resources for the nation’s security agents and the need for the heads of the agencies to sit up or be shown the way out. He said anyone of them found not to be living up to expectations at the end of a particular timeline should be sacked. He said, “I think we must tell ourselves the truth that the security situation in the country, especially in the northern part of the country, requires that we give much more resources to the security agencies.

This is because the lives of Nigerians are so precious and therefore must be more important than any other considerations or sentiments.”
