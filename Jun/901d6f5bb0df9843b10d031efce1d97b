Ebenezer Bajela Veteran Nigerian women’s table tennis player, Funke Oshonaike, says she developed hatred for sex after she was raped as a young girl. The six-time Olympian stated this while reacting to the rape and murder of Uwa Omozuwa, the 22-year-old 100 level student of the University of Benin, inside a church in Benin City, the Edo State capital. “It’s my true life story. Terrible experience for me and it affected my sex life. I hated sex. I don’t want to tell my entire story for now because of my autobiography that’s coming soon,” Oshonaike stated. She also pleaded with parents to raise their male kids in the right way, saying it would help prevent the scourge. “I have been a victim and know how terrible it is. Women should rise up and fight this scourge,” the former Nigerian champion stated.
