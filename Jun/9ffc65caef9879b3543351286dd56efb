’Tosin Oluwalowo Former Super Eagles assistant coach Sylvanus Okpala has hailed the four-year permanent deal Moses Simon signed with French Ligue 1 side, Nantes. Simon sealed a permanent deal on Monday, which takes effect from July 1, after spending this season on loan at the French side from Levante. He had earlier emerged the club’s Player of The Season after the Ligue 1 was called off due to COVID-19. Okpala in a chat with our correspondent said the move was right for the Eagles winger. “It is good for him as long as he is making his money,” the former Enugu Rangers coach said. “I hope it’s a good money move. When you move to a club, you look at your age because you play football with age. “Once you are in your 30s, you have fewer years to play. It doesn’t mean that you are making that move solely for the money, you are moving to get to the next level in your career in terms of one transition to the other, not necessarily for money,” he said. According to him, Simon must also ensure he features regularly for the French outfit. “Playing every weekend and not sitting on the bench is the most important thing. But you don’t just move for moving sake, you also move for money, football is all about making name and making money,” the 1980 Africa Cup of Nations winner added. Copyright PUNCH.
