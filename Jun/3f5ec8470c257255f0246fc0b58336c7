Patrick Odey, Uyo AKWA Ibom State Government said on Wednesday that it had dropped all the charges preferred against Emmanuel Effiong, a pastor of the Christ Embassy Church, located at Nung Akpa Ime, off Nsikak Eduok Avenue, Uyo. Effiong was arrested on Sunday, June 21, 2020, and the church sealed by the state government for allegedly flouting COVID-19 guidelines during the congregational worship held that day. But the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Charles Udoh, in a statement in Uyo, said having listened to entreaties from individuals and groups, the government had decided to drop charges against the pastor. The statement read in part, “Following entreaties from well meaning individuals and groups, the Akwa Ibom State Government has dropped charges against Pastor Emmanuel Effiong of Christ Embassy Church, Nung Akpa Ime branch, off Nsikak Eduok Avenue, Uyo.” Copyright PUNCH.
