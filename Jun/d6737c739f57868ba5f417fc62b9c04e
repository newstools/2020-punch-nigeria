John Alechenu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress on Monday displayed the academic credentials of all six contestants in the forthcoming Edo State governorship primary. The six aspirants are Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, Godwin Obaseki, Dr Pius Odubu, Chris Ogiemwonyi, Osaro Obazee and Matthew Iduoriyekemwen. Speaking at the APC National Secretariat, Abuja, on Monday, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said, “We have had experience that are not so palatable. We have had experiences that are so shocking and we won’t be doing the right thing if we don’t learn from those experiences. “You will recall what happened in Bayelsa; we thought we did the best we should, but it turned out that we did not do enough. So, the best thing we have to do now is to go beyond ourselves to the things that may not be known to us. “Beside the fact that we have put it out here for anybody who has information to help the screening committee, we are also taking official steps to verify some of these documents to be sure that we do the right thing and come out clean.” He also dismissed calls for an emergency National Executive Committee meeting. In response to a question on the subject, he said, “Why should there be an emergency meeting, what is the emergency, Covid-19?” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
