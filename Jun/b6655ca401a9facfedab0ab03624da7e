Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday struck out a suit seeking to disqualify the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, from contesting the forthcoming governorship election in the state for allegedly forging his university certificate. The suit was filed on May 29, 2020, by Edebor Williams, Ugesia Godwin and Amedu Anakhu, ahead of the governorship election scheduled to be held in the state on September 19. Joined as respondents in the suit were Obaseki, the governor’s former party, the All Progressives Congress, and the Inspector-General of Police. But Justice Anwuli Chikere struck out the suit on Monday as neither the plaintiffs’ lawyers nor the defendants were present in court. The plaintiffs alleged in the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/553/2020, that the University of Ibadan certificate which he attached to his Form CF.001 which he submitted to INEC for his first term election in 2016 was forged. They contended that this was “contrary to the provisions of section 182(1)(i) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999”. According to them, Obaseki was, therefore, “not qualified to run or seek the office of Governor of Edo State under the platform of the 1st defendant (APC) in the governorship election scheduled to hold in the state on September 19, 2020.” Copyright PUNCH.
