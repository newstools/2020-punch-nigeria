Friday Olokor, Abuja The Chief Medical Director of Bingham University Teaching Hospital, Prof. Edwin Eseigbe, has identified health promotion and community engagement as key factors in the prevention and of COVID -19. Eseigbe said this during a COVID-19 awareness held in the Gurum community, Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State. “The campaign was organised to teach elders in the Gurum community how to implement preventive measures through the formation of a socio-cultural committee that includes men, women and youths.” “We already have standard guidelines from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, but the problem is that these guidelines are not being followed in the communities, while some villages don’t have information. We believe that community engagement is key to preventing the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. “The traditional rulers should form a socio-cultural committee that will comprise opinion leaders, market leaders, youth leaders, women leaders and they will undergo training, scale down and ensure that people observe the rules, including the use of face masks, social distancing, physical distancing, respiratory hygiene, and handwashing in their various social-cultural units,” Eseigbe said. The CMD said the awareness was part of the hospital’s contribution to stop the spread of COVID-19. A former permanent secretary, Ministry of Health in Plateau State, Dr. Ishaya Agaldo, while thanking the hospital for the awareness, urged the community elders to take back the knowledge they have acquired to their various communities.
