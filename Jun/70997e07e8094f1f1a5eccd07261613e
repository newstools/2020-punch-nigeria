Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The National Assembly Service Commission has described as illegal, the retention of the Clerk to the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani-Omolori, and about 150 other members of the management staff in service. The NASC, in a memo to President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, stated that only the commission, by the law establishing it, had the powers to regulate the conditions of service of National Assembly workers. A committee set up by the NASC to review the condition of service approved for legislative staff by the 8th National Assembly had recommended the removal of tenure elongation for the management staff members. The panel’s report, if adopted and approved, will lead to the exit of Sani-Omolori and over 150 other senior staff members. In the memo, a copy of which our correspondent obtained, the Chairman of the NASC, Ahmed Amshi, told both Lawan and Gbajabiamila that Section 19 (1) of the NASC Act, 2014, empowered only the commission to determine the tenure and condition of service of National Assembly workers. The section read in part, “Subject to the provision of this Act, the commission may make regulations relating generally to the conditions of service, including the power to fix salaries and allowances, of the staff of the National Assembly…” Copyright PUNCH.
