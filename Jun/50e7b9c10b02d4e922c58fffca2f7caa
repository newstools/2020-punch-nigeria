The PUNCH had earlier reported that the Federal Government said civil aviation authorities will determine the resumption of domestic flights in the country. The National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Sani Aliyu, had on June 1 said that “the aviation industry is requested to start developing protocols to allow for domestic flights to resume anytime from the 21st of June onwards.” However, while giving an update last week, Aliyu said the PTF was yet to receive any update from the aviation sector on its preparedness to restart commercial flight operations. Nigeria’s airports and airspace were shut in March by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as part of efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. But the President’s directive allowed the operation of essential flights including those for medical and evacuation purposes, amongst others.
