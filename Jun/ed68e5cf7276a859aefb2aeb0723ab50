Enyioha Opara, Minna THE Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on Wednesday said it had started oil exploration activities in the Bida, Sokoto basin, covering eight local government areas of Niger State. The Group Managing Director, NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, made this known when he visited Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State to unveil the 2D seismic data acquisition in the Bida Sokoto basin. Kyari, who was represented by the NNPC Group General Manager, Frontier Exploration Services, Abdullahi Bomai, said an in-depth geological and geochemical study showed that there were strong hydrocarbon bearing indicators that had been confirmed as oil and gas bearing formations in the eight local governments in Niger State, which extended to two other local governments in Kwara State and one in Kogi State. Kyari said, “Significant progress is being made in the ongoing exploration of inland basins, with a realistic and achievable target of growing the nation’s reserve to 40 million barrels by year 2023.” Copyright PUNCH.
