Maiharaji Altine, Gusau Twenty-one people were killed by bandits in Maru and Talata-Mafara Local Government Areas of Zamfara State in fresh attacks. Confirming the story, the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Mohammed Shehu, said, on 2nd and 3rd June 2020, six villages namely:- Tungar Malan, Manyan Karaje, Tungar Arne, Dangodon Maiyakane, Dangodon Mai Masallaci and Boleke in Maru LGA were attacked by suspected armed bandits with the intent to rustle cows. Shehu said, “When confronted by members of the milia group known as “YAN SAKAI”, they started shooting ‘sporadically’, thereby resulting in the death of fifteen people, while seven others sustained gunshot wounds and rushed to the hospital for treatment. “On 3rd June 2020, Bandits attacked and killed six people from four villages namely:- Gidan Dan Kani, Tungar Lauti, Inwala and Dangodo villages in Talata Mafara LGA.” The victims, according to him were attacked and killed while coming back from a funeral prayer of their people killed by bandits. He, however, refuted media reports which indicated that 60 people were killed by bandits during the two attacks. “The report which indicates that gunmen attacked over ten (10) villages in Talata Mafara LGA and killed over 60 people, and on the other hand attacked four villages and killed another sixty 60 people in Maru LGA was not only inaccurate but misleading and unfounded. “In view of the above, the Zamfara State Police Command hereby refutes such unfounded report and urge the press to patiently wait to have the accurate report of events before publication so as not to put members of the public in confusion and fear,” Shehu said.
