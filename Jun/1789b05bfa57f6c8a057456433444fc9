Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, on Monday described the attack on his person by the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party as malicious. Aregbesola, who was a former governor of the state, said this in a statement by his media aide, Sola Fasure, in Osogbo on Monday. The PDP had in a release on Sunday, urged the former governor to admit that he failed the state during his tenure as governor. The party was reacting to issues raised during a virtual colloquium organised to mark Aregbesola’s 63rd birthday. The opposition said the loans obtained by the administration were above the collateral size of the state. In response, Aregbesola said the attack on his person was an indication that the PDP had taken malice to  a new low, adding that the case of the party might be beyond redemption. The statement reads, “It is a collection of mumbo jumbo, asinine and puerile effusions emanating from diseased minds. “If they can find faults with award winning programmes copied by other states and multilateral agencies like the World Bank and UNICEF, and will disparage excellent performance and the sound judgements of established and respected professionals and experts, then the PDP in Osun has taken malice to a new low and their case may be beyond redemption.” Copyright PUNCH.
