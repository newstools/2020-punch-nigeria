Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Modakeke, Osun State, Manashe Ehile, on Monday, alleged that some suspected political thugs sent by a party leader loyal to ex-governor Rauf Aregbesola, on Sunday, disrupted the inauguration of ‘4 + 4 = Oyetola’ initiative. Ehile told The PUNCH on the telephone on Monday that the event was nearly marred by the armed men, who stormed St. Stephen’s ‘B’ Primary School, Famia Road. He, however, said the 12 suspects, after they had been overpowered, mentioned Rasheed Opatola, the ex-special adviser on environment to Aregbesola as their sponsor. “One particular man called ‘Ori’ was said to be destroying the billboard of ‘4 +4 = Oyetola at the venue. But when we got to the venue, we calmed people down. “Later, some thugs were sent to disrupt the event. We were able to identify and apprehended some of them and they said Rasheed Opatola sent them. “About 12 of them were apprehended and we later released them after they apologised and confessed that they were sent,” Ehile said.

On that Sunday, I was in an APC meeting alongside 18 other leaders of the party where we were discussing the progress of the party in our local council development area.” Copyright PUNCH.
