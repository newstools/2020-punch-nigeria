Maiharaji Altine, Gusau THE battle line has been drawn between the All Progressives Congress and the Zamfara State Government over the demolition of some buildings in Talata-Mafara town belonging to APC members. The government had through the Zamfara State Urban and Regional Planning Board demolished some structures in Talata-Mafara belonging to former governor Abdulaziz Yari’s younger brother, Yahaya, and his friend, Bello Mafara. The APC, through its chairman, Alhaji Lawal Liman, described the action of the state government as unconstitutional and vowed to challenge it in court for demolishing the buildings that were legally constructed. Reacting to the APC’s threat, the Director-General of the state Urban and Regional Planning Board, Alhaji Sanusi Lilo, in a statement said, “The board was established by Edict No. 2 of October 1996 to control and manage all land development and town planning activities in the state.” According to him, the board received a series of complaints from the general public that the developers of the two structures in Talata-Mafara grossly contravened the provisions of the edict establishing the board and other land use regulations.
