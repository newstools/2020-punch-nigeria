Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Peoples Democratic Party’s stakeholders in the Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of Bayelsa State under the auspices of the Voice of KOLGA have insisted that the LG should produce a replacement for Governor Douye Diri to represent Bayelsa Central Senatorial District at the National Assembly. The spokesman for the Voice of KOLGA, Mr Kelvin Ingbaifegha, told journalists after the group’s meeting in Kaiama on Monday that the LG was entitled to finish Diri’s tenure at the National Assembly. Ingbaifegha said, “In 2015, Sagbama LGA produced Senator Foster Ogola and the then governor, Seriake Dickson. “It was no doubt Sagbama’s turn to produce a senator, regardless that they had a governor because Ekeremor LGA had just finished its eight years at the Senate through Senator Heineken Lokpobiri.” The Voice of KOLGA contended that before Diri, the local government had not produced any senator.
