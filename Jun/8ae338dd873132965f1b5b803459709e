WALE OYEWALE The Chief Press Secretary to Oyo State Governor, Mr Taiwo Adisa, has described the recent criticisms of his principal by a former governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress in the 2019 elections, Chief Niyi Akintola (SAN), as “an indication of his desperation to hug the headlines.” Adisa, in a statement made available to journalists in Ibadan, the state capital, on Saturday, said it was a thing of concern that a senior lawyer like Akintola could join the bandwagon of opposition elements trying to manipulate and distort government policies in the state. The statement read in part, “Chief Niyi Akintola alleged that the government in Oyo State reversed eight out of 10 policies. “That’s an unkind fabrication, a white lie that cannot stand in the real sense and one that should not have come from Akintola. Can he give evidence of any such policy somersault? Surely, he can’t. Adisa added,” I think Chief Akintola should make up his mind on whether he wants to be a friend of Governor Makinde or a blind critic of his administration. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
