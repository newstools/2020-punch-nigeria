Kelvin Ekerete Belgian club, KRC Gent, have reached an agreement to sign striker Cyriel Dessers for €4m on a four-year deal from Dutch side, Heracles Almelo, according to reports in Holland. Heracles had valued the Belgian-born striker at €6m, with Genk unwilling to pay, but according to nieuwsblad.be, a deal has been reached. Dessers will join compatriots Paul Onuachu and Stephen Odey at the former Belgian champions. Dessers became a top priority for the club after the void left by the departure of Tanzanian striker, Mbwana Samatta, who made an £8.5m move to English Premier League side, Aston Villa, in January. The 25-year-old had a season to remember before the Eredivisie was cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak. He scored 15 goals in 26 appearances to emerge joint top scorer with Feyenoord’s Steven Berghuis in the Eredivise. Dessers has earlier attracted interests from LaLiga side Celta Vigo and Serie A’s SPAL, but both teams were put off by the player’s asking price of €4m. The striker, who has a Nigerian mother, was handed his first call up to the Super Eagles in March in a botched 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match versus Sierra Leone. Copyright PUNCH.
