John Alechenu, Abuja The Director-General of the Progressives Governors’ Forum, Salihu Lukeman, has urged leaders and members of the All Progressives Congress to rally behind the President, Major General Muhammudu Buhari (retd.), to ensure Thursday’s National Executive Committee meeting succeeds. He made the appeal in a statement he issued in Abuja, on Wednesday. According to him, the NEC meeting is what the party needs to douse growing tensions within the rank and file of the party. The statement read in part, “All committed party members and leaders should rally behind President Buhari in support of the scheduled NEC to hold so that we are able to reset the APC back to its 2013 orientation of inclusive and participatory politics.

With all the confusion as to who is our presiding officer, coupled with the fact that the most important structure that is saddled with the responsibility of convening meetings of all organs of the party is fractured and entangled in webs of legal cases, it is either the confusion is allowed to continue and eventual end with the demise of the party, or our leaders find a way to save the party.” He explained that one would expect leaders of the party to unite to save the situation but expressed sadness that some of them were instead using proxies to try to block genuine efforts to save the situation through the convocation of meetings of party organs in order to undermine such efforts.
