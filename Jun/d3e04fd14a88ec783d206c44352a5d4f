Matthew Ochei and Dele Ogunyemi One person has reportedly sustained injury following a clash between vigilantes and Fulani herdsmen in Ogodo and Iburubu communities in the Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State. It was gathered that the incident occurred on Saturday when the vigilantes were working to ensure all herdsmen living in the bush came out to live in the towns and villages of the community. The Chairman of Aniocha North LGA, Mr Chuks Oseme, had inaugurated the vigilante group to evict herdsmen from the bushes and make them live in the town. It was learnt that the herdsmen resisted the vigilantes and engaged them in a shootout, injuring one of the vigilantes. A community source said, “The herdsmen are saying that they will not leave the bush. They started shooting and one of the vigilantes got injured but he is receiving treatment in hospital.” The state police spokesperson, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, said, “I have spoken with the DPO in the area, he said the issue has been resolved.” Copyright PUNCH.
