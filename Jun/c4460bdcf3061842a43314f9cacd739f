Maiharaji Altine, Gusau The All Progressives Congress, Zamfara State has kicked against the recent dissolution of local government councils by the state House of Assembly and vowed to take legal action to reverse the decision. The state House of Assembly had last week dissolved the 14 elected local government councils in the state due to misappropriation of funds and their inability to stop banditry. But in a statement, the state APC chairman, Alhaji Lawal Liman, said, “The dissolution of the democratically elected local government councils by the state House of Assembly is a violation of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” Liman said the action of the legislators showed that there was a truncation of democracy at the local government level, warning that it would not be accepted by the APC. “We will take legal action to reverse the dissolution because APC is a political party that has been ensuring adherence to the rule of law for its strong conviction that this will guarantee democratic stability in the country,” he said. Liman said it was unfortunate that Governor Bello Matawalle of the Peoples Democratic Party and the state’s lawmakers who were brought to power through the court’s verdict could violate the constitutional provision by dissolving democratically elected local government councils in the state.
