Kelvin Ekerete Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, says the ministry will be properly guided in its decision to announce a new date for the Edo 2020 National Sports Festival after receiving the report of the committee set up to review the state’s readiness to host the event. The sports festival, earlier scheduled to hold in Benin City, the Edo State capital, between March 22 to April 1, was postponed after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Dare, who received the report from the chairman of the committee, Tonobok Okowa, thanked the members for being timely, stating that the content of the report would be properly analysed before arriving on a new date. “I thank you for keeping to the schedule of your mandate. We shall study your report; sit down with relevant agencies of government to examine the recommendations there-in. The ministry is properly guided by COVID-19 protocol and will not shy away from making decisions based on the reality on ground. “This is a milestone to determine when to start sporting activities, but we would not jeorpardise the health and wellbeing of our sportsmen and women,” he said.
