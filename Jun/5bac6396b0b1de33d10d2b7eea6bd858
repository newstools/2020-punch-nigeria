Chelsea have announced the signing of RB Leipzig and Germany International striker Timo Werner ahead of next season. The Blues confirmed the signing in a statement released on their official website on Thursday. Werner agreed to join Chelsea on a five-year deal after they paid £47.5m to trigger his release clause and which will see him earn more than £9m per season in England. He becomes Chelsea’s second signing following the capture of Hakim Ziyech from Ajax. The statement read in part, “Chelsea Football Club has reached an agreement with RB Leipzig to sign Timo Werner. “The 24-year-old has agreed personal terms with the Blues, and will remain at the German club for the rest of the Bundesliga season. He will link up with his new team-mates in July, subject to passing a medical examination.” Commenting on his Chelsea move, Werner said, “I am delighted to be signing for Chelsea, it is a very proud moment for me to be joining this great club. I of course want to thank RB Leipzig, the club and the fans, for four fantastic years. You will forever be in my heart. “I look forward to next season with my new team-mates, my new manager and of course the Chelsea fans. Together we have a very successful future ahead of us.” One of the most feared young strikers in Europe, Werner is renowned for his pace, movement, link-up play and finishing ability.
