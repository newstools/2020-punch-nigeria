I had malaria two days ago and was treated. I did get over it. “At the APC NEC meeting, one of my colleagues spoke with me. He advised that malaria should not be just treated as likely. That I should go ahead and have a test for COVID-19. “The result came out today, June 30, 2020, and I tested positive. But I am asymptomatic. I am not feeling sick nor feeling odd in any way. “But my doctor has said that I should take the necessary steps and self-isolate. I believe that supervised home management would be ideal for me for now.”
