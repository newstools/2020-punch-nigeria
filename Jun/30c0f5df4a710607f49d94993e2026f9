Chima Azubuike, Gombe Gombe State task force on Tuesday said the nine government officials who tested positive to Covid-19 are on home isolation. The Chairman, Prof. Idris Mohammed, disclosed this while answering question on why government officials who tested positive were not in isolation centres, during the daily briefing on the activities of the committee to mitigate spread. He said, “Those on self -isolation at home; we visit them every day to give them medication and to ensure they are not breaking the rules we set for them. “They don’t go out anywhere; they can go out within their premises but they can’t go out on the streets. We do that so they do not spread coronavirus in the community. “These are people who fully understand the consequences of breaking these rules and we have taken hours counselling them. “These are people who have facilities in their places; what they did was to move to their guest houses, so that they will not spread it, even to their families and their families will ensure they don’t go out. Our problem is members of the society at the community level.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
