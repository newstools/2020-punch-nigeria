Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja Barely 24 hours after a popular businessman, Nicholas Ofodile, was killed on the Abuja/Lokoja Expressway in Kogi State, six of the victims abducted during the operation have been rescued by the police. The command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP William Aya, in a statement made available to journalists, said the suspected kidnappers shot dead Ofodile, a popular super market operator in Lokoja, on Wednesday. A commercial motor driver also lost his life in the attack, while yet-to-be ascertained number of persons were marched into the bush by the hoodlums. Aya stated that the police swung into action following a distress call and rescued six of the abducted persons. He added that a manhunt had been launched for the bandits with a view to rescuing the other victims and bringing the perpetrators to justice. The incident came barely a week after gunmen killed no fewer than 10 police personnel at the Isanlu Police Station in the Yagba West Local Government Area of the state. Meanwhile, the state government has concluded plans to embark on massive orientation of the people about security to stem the tide of insecurity in the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
