Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission said it has seized a multi-million naira property belonging to the Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed. The property, which housed  Zinaria International School, is located at Plot 298 Wuye District, Cadastral Zone B3, FCT, Abuja. The commission said the seizure was pursuant to its powers contained in Section 45 (4) (a-c) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000. The commission, in a statement on Tuesday by its spokesperson, Mrs Rasheedat Okoduwa, said the governor will be prosecuted after his tenure as “he currently enjoys immunity by virtue of Section 308 of the 1999 Constitution.” The governor was also expected to stand trial on charges of corruption filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission against him. The statement said, “ICPC’s investigation revealed that Mohammed, in his official capacity as the FCT minister, had allocated the said property to a school that had himself and family members as directors and shareholders, despite an existing right of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture over the land.
