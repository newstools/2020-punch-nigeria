The Governor, gave the order at the government house in Port Harcourt, when the Executive Director, BUA Foundation presented three ambulances to support the fight against the pandemic. According to a statement signed by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, the governor insisted that more testing be done to reveal more cases that were yet symptomatic to enable the government to promptly provide the medical attention needed by such individuals in the state. He said, “The more we test, the more the numbers will increase and we are willing to continue to test. Let our people know that this is not the kind of sickness to be ashamed of, nobody knows who you have shaken hands with. “I’m sure in Rivers State, we have lost not less than 38 lives on the record. Nobody will be happy that each day you wake up, you hear that somebody, probably a breadwinner of the family, is no longer there because of COVID-19 pandemic. “In fact, I have given a directive that all staff of government House must go for testing. Nobody knows who is a carrier and we must save everybody as much as we can.”
