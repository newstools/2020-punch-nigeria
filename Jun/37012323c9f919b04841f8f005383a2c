Peter Dada, Akure Ondo State Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, says Governor Rotimi Akeredolu will overcome COVID-19 and continue to pilot the affairs of the state. Ajayi, who said he received the news of the governor testing positive for the virus, called on the people of the state to pray for the Akeredolu’s quick recovery. This was contained in a statement issued on Tuesday by Ajayi’s media aide, Allen Sowore. Sowore said his principal was relieved by the disclosure of the governor that he was asymptomatic and in stable condition whilst on self-isolation. Sowore said, “The Deputy Governor urges all the people of Ondo State to pray for Mr Governor’s quickest recovery and general wellbeing. Health is not something to play politics with and as such craves the cooperation of all at this period. “It is our fervent prayer that the Governor will overcome this to continue to pilot the affairs of the State for the progress and prosperity of all.”
