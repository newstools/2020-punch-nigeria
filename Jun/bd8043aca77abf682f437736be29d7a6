Peter Dada, Akure A man, suspected to be an armed robber, was on Thursday arrested by men of the Ondo State Police Command after killing one of his gang members in Okitipupa, headquarters of the Okitipupa Local Government Area of the state. It was gathered that the suspect and his gang members had robbed a Point of Sales operator in the town, but he mistakenly shot dead one of his gang members while trying to escape from the scene. An eyewitness said the robbers stormed the PoS centre in the morning and dispossessed the operator of an undisclosed amount of money. He said, “After robbing the PoS operator, the hoodlums were trying to escape, but the victim quickly raised the alarm and called on the people around for help. “As the people were chasing them, one of the robbers brought out a gun and shot in the air to disperse the crowd, but the bullet hit his accomplice in the head and he was later arrested and handed over to the police.” The eyewitness added that when the men of the Okitipupa Police Division got to the scene, they recovered some items from the deceased, including a gun and the money stolen from the PoS operator. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, confirmed the incident and said investigation had commenced into the matter. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
