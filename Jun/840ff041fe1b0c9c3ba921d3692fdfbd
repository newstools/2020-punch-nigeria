Faki, who revealed he was a refugee for eight years, made the call on Saturday on the occasion of this year’s World Refugee Day with the theme, “Every Action Counts”. “Nobody chooses to be a refugee. I know. I was a refugee for 8 years of my life. Ask anybody who has ever had to be in that position. Listen to and act with and for refugees,” he tweeted.
