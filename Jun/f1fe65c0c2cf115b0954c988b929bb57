Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The mosque located inside the Presidential Villa, Abuja resumed religious activities on Friday with Juma’at service after weeks of closure due to the restriction placed on worship places as part of measures to curtail the spread of COVID-19. The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 had on Monday announced the relaxation of the restriction with effect from Tuesday, asking state governments to design guidelines for reopening of worship centres. The Federal Capital Territory Administration on Thursday met with religious leaders where they adopted the guidelines issued by the PTF. The guidelines include that worship centres shall make provision for washing of hands, use alcohol-based sanitisers, use of face masks and ensuring physical distancing among other precautionary measures.
