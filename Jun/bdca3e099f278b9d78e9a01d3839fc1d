Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna THE Speaker of the Kaduna State House of Assembly, Yusuf Zailani, has directed all members and staff to go for COVID-19 tests. This followed the discovery of a coronavirus positive case among the Assembly staff. Deputy Chairman House Committee on Health, Ali Kalat, on Tuesday said the directive became imperative to know the status of members and staff of the Assembly since a worker was tested positive for the virus. He added that none of the 34 members of the assembly so far tested positive for the virus. He said,”The speaker has given directives that the entire workforce of the assembly should be subjected to coronavirus tests and the exercise is still going on at the assembly. “Going forward, we have to surrender ourselves for testing so that we will be sure that the entire members of the assembly and its workforce are COVID-19 negative.” Copyright PUNCH.
