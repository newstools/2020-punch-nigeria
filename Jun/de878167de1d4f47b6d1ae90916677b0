James Abraham, Jos A research committee on COVID-19 set up by the Plateau State Government, on Friday, said it discovered a total of 13 plants in the state that showed antiviral activities, which could lead to the cure of the infectious disease. Chairman of the committee and Lead Researcher, Prof Noel Wannang, while addressing journalists after submitting their report in Jos, noted that 10 of the plants were specifically selected based on “pharmacokinetic parameters of their phytochemical constituents and formulated into three cocktails (COV-Pla1, Covid-Pla 2 and Cov-Pla 3).” According to him, the results may provide an important breakthrough in the field of herbal medicine.
