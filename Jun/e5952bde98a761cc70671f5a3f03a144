’Tosin Oluwalowo Two Nigerian track and field athletes have benefitted from the World Athletics and the International Athletics Foundation’s welfare fund. This was disclosed by the Athletics Federation of Nigeria in a press release signed by the Director-General, Siminialayi Pepple, in a press release on Thursday. The AFN however failed to name the athletes. “Seven of our 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games bound athletes qualified for the grant based on the guidelines released by the WA in its circular of May 2020. “We kept in touch with the WA through the Confederation of African Athletics and on May 31, the WA released a circular announcing that 193 athletes from 58 member federations had been approved for the ‘one time grant’. “Of this number, the AFN is pleased to inform that two of our athletes have been contacted by the WA to inform them of the success of their applications and the further necessary steps leading up to the release of the grants,” the AFN said. WA and the IAF had put the funds in place to cushion the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on athletes who have met the entry standard and qualified for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The WA said athletes would be entitled to a maximum of $4,000 support per athlete. Saturday PUNCH had earlier reported that Usheoritse Itsekiri and Chukwuebuka Enekwechi applied for the World Athletics and the International Athletics Foundation’s $500,000 welfare fund. Pepple on Thursday, however, said the WA did not disclose the names of the athletes picked to the AFN. “WA has not announced names. They have contacted athletes,” he said. Copyright PUNCH.
