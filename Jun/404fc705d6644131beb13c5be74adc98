The Police in Kaduna State have confirmed the death of a 17-year-old boy in Zaria, while being interrogated by the State Vigilance Service (KadVS) over alleged theft of a cell phone. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, ASP Muhammad Jalige, confirmed the incident to journalists on Friday. Jalige said that the Commander of KadVS at Jan Labule, Kofar Doka Unit, in Zaria, Alhaji Abubakar and six others had been detained at the Police Divisional Headquartres in the town. The PPRO added that the suspects would be transferred to the Police Command in Kaduna for further investigation, the News Agency of Nigeria reports. The father of the boy, Mallam Dauda Aliyu of Filin Mallawa, Zaria, said on Friday that his son, Muhammad-Sani Aliyu, died while being interrogated by KadVS over alleged phone theft. Dauda said that the incident occurred on Wednesday around 2pm after a butcher, one Auwalu, alleged that Muhammad-Sani stole his phone. He said, “As a father, I question him over the issue but he insisted that he knew nothing about the phone. I later requested my friend, Abubakar Dan-Bakano, to question him about the phone. He (late son) maintained his earlier stand that he did not steal any phone. “While Abubakar Dan-Bakano was questioning my late son, the complainant, Auwalu, arrived with personnel of vigilance service, who took him to their office at Jan Labule, Kofar Doka, Zaria where he lost his life during interrogation.” The mother of the late boy, Hannatu, said that those responsible for the death of her son should be fished out and brought to justice.
