Patrick Odey, Uyo The Federal Government has been told to raise gas flaring penalties to serve as disincentive to international oil companies. The government has also been urged to commit to a three-year gas flare-out plan in order to free the Niger Delta region from environmental pollution caused by gas flaring. These were parts of the resolutions at the end of a webinar training for journalists and civil society organisations, oil and gas operators, entitled ‘Impact of gas flare on oil-producing communities and discrepancies in gas flare data – a clarion call to action. It was organised by African Initiative for Transparency and Responsible Leadership. Speaking at the training workshop, a former President of PENGASSAN and founder of the group, Louis Ogbeifun, noted that the way Nigeria could reinvent itself was not by borrowing but by plugging all the hemorrhaging points in her economy.
