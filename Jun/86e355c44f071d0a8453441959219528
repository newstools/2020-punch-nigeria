Friday Olokor A former governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the 2019 general elections, Uche Nwosu, has called on the South East to apologise to other geo-political zones and get their support for the realisation of the 2023 Presidency. He, however, cautioned that the agitation of the Presidency in 2023 was too early because it could constitute a distraction to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd). According to him, the emergence of Buhari since 2015 will be the shortest route to Igbo Presidency in Nigeria. Nwosu, a son-in-law to ex-governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State, spoke with journalists in Abuja. Nwosu said, “It is too early to talk of 2023 Presidency. It is a distraction for the Presidency. No particular zone should be denied the Presidency of Nigeria. I believe in that stanza of our national anthem. Although tribes and tongues may differ, in brotherhood will stand. “But the South-East cannot get the Presidency alone. I keep telling my people that you can’t be talking of the Presidency and be abusing the South-West and others like the North because politics is a game of numbers and we need their support. “The South-East should beg other zones to get the 2023 Presidency. We should wait and embark on the reconciliation first.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
