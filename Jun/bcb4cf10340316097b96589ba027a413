Deji Lambo The Lagos State Police Command has dismissed speculations that its personnel arrested six armed robbers during an operation in the Ikoyi area of the state on Wednesday. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, explained in a statement on Thursday that contrary to the claim made in a viral video, those arrested were traffic offenders and not robbers. He said, “The attention of the Lagos State Police Command has been drawn to a viral video and reports on the social media that there was a robbery incident in Ikoyi on June 17, 2020, and that six armed robbers were arrested. The report is completely false, mischievous and misleading. “What actually happened was that some LAWMA officials used their truck to block another motorist, whom they had earlier had a misunderstanding with, thereby causing gridlock. As they were arguing, members of a military patrol team passing by and caught in the artificial gridlock went to find out the cause of the traffic, arrested all those causing the obstruction and handed them over to the police. “No robbery took place and no arms and ammunition were recovered from anybody as being speculated. The six suspects arrested were traffic offenders and not armed robbers. Members of the public are advised to disregard this and go about their lawful business.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
