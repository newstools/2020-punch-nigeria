Enyioha Opara, Minna A 25-year-old man, Ezekiel Yanana, who was arrested by the Niger State Police Command for allegedly raping an 85-year-old woman, has pleaded for forgiveness, saying he did not know what came over him. The Niger State Police Public Relations Officer, Wasiu Abiodun, said on Friday that the suspect was apprehended by operatives attached to Kagara Police Division, adding that the matter would be taken to court soon. Abiodun explained that the suspect confessed to the crime during interrogation, noting that the victim was rescued by her grandson. It was learnt that the victim, Bitahara Maibago, was sleeping in her room when the suspect entered and threatened to kidnap her. The suspect, in the process, reportedly had sexual intercourse with the woman until her grandson, one Achidawa, rescued her. Saturday PUNCH gathered that the suspect had been involved in the heinous act for over four years before he was eventually arrested by police operatives. Yunana of Ungwan Ya’u Tukunguna village in the Rafi Local Government Area told our correspondent that he had forcefully had carnal knowledge of women older than his mother in the community. He said, “I don’t know what has come over me that each time I see elderly women, I have feelings for them. I have been in the act and I enjoyed doing it, but at times I ask myself why I am into this wicked act. I am finished.” Copyright PUNCH.
