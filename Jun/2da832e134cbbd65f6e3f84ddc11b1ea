Oladimeji Ramon A former Ondo State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Eyitayo Jegede (SAN), has said the Peoples Democratic Party will dislodge the ruling All Progressives Congress from the state in the forthcoming governorship election. Jegede, who is aspiring to contest the Ondo State governorship election on the PDP platform, described the APC as a sinking ship. Speaking through a former Commissioner for Environment, Chief Lebi Adepiti, in a statement on Sunday, Jegede vowed to unseat Governor Rotimi Akeredolu through the poll. “The APC’s days are numbered not only in Ondo State but also all over the country. The crises that have engulfed the APC are ominous signs that things have fallen apart within it. Everyone can see that they are no longer at ease. A fish rots from its head. The APC is crisis-ridden from the very top. They no longer know where their ship is sailing. A party that cannot govern itself cannot govern anyone else,” he said. Jegede said the PDP’s doors were open to defectors, including Akeredolu’s deputy, Mr Agboola Ajayi, who just left the APC. He said, “We are democrats in the PDP and the sky is wide enough for all of us. No imposition and no dictatorship. A politician’s popularity must be his asset.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
