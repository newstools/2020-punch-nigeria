Bayern Munich have agreed on a deal to sign winger Leroy Sane from Manchester City, according to various media reports in Germany and England on Tuesday. The 24-year-old was reportedly close to signing for Bayern last year before suffering a knee injury. Sky Sports and the BBC say the two clubs have agreed a fee of £54.8 million (59.97 million euros, $67.36 million), with German daily Bild reporting a fee of “at least 50 million euros”. Bild said Sane will sign a five-year contract at the German champions, with the transfer fee far lower than the 100 million euros mentioned last year.
