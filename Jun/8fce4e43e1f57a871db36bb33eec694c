Peter Dada, Akure Following the ongoing cold war between the Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, and his deputy, Mr Agboola Ajayi, it was gathered on Sunday that the latter was ready to defect to the Peoples Democratic Party this week. It was also learnt that Ajayi was planning to contest the ticket of the PDP in the primaries of the party. A source in the PDP told our correspondent that the party was ready to receive the deputy governor, saying his return would boost the chances of the PDP taking over the government from the All Progressives Congress. The source said, “We are happy that he (Ajayi) is coming back to the PDP, because we are sure that he will make impact in the party in the  next governorship election.” Another source said the coming of the deputy governor had caused dissatisfaction among some aspirants and leaders of the PDP. The Director of Media and Publicity of the state PDP, Mr Zadok Akintoye, said the party was ready to receive the embattled deputy governor, saying such would not caused any disaffection. Ajayi has been keeping mum on the matter but his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Tope Okeowo, in a text message said, “As we speak he ( Ajayi) is still a member of the APC.” Copyright PUNCH.
