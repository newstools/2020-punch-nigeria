Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Governor of Bayelsa State, Mr Douye Diri, has called for a review of the 13 per cent derivation formula, saying the current percentage does not reflect the sufferings of the Niger Delta people and the damage done to the region’s environment. He made the call at the weekend during an online conference themed, ‘The Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on the Aquatic Flora and Fauna of the Niger Delta,’ to mark this year’s World Environment Day. The conference, which was hosted by the Bayelsa State Ministry of the Environment, had discussants simultaneously in Yenagoa, Benin and Abuja.
