Peter Dada, Akure As the trial of the four suspected killers of the daughter of Chief Reuben Fasoranti, Mrs Funke Olakunri, continued, the Ondo State Department of Public Prosecution has declared that the defendants had a case to answer. Mrs Olakunri was killed on the Benin-Owo Expressway, Ore in Odigbo Local Government Area of the state last July. The men of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad subsequently arrested four persons in connection with the incident. The four defendants, Muhammed Shehu,  Mazaje Lawal, Adamu Adamu, and Awalu Abubakar, were  arraigned before a Chief Magistrates’ Court, Akure, on four counts of conspiracy, kidnapping, murder and unlawful possession of firearms. However, the Chief Magistrate, Mrs Victoria Bob-Manuel, ordered that the matter should be transferred to the state High Court citing the legal advice  by the DPP. She ordered the release of late Olakunri’s driver, Femi Adeyemi, and urged the police to intensify the manhunt for other members of the gang. The Ondo State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Kola Olawoye, who presented the DPP advice  before the court,  assured that the case would soon commence at the High Court. The case was adjourned until June 24 for a final review of the legal advice. Copyright PUNCH.
