As you are aware, the main focus is on community engagement and risk communication while not neglecting the need to obey all the guidelines and non-pharmaceutical measures. “We, therefore, crave your buy-in so that we can collectively become champions in the efforts to wipe out the virus. “Always remember, that the virus is real, potent, and dangerous. Our relaxed lockdown should never be interpreted to mean otherwise. This point is further underscored by a reported resurgence of the second wave in countries like China and the USA and this should put all of us on alert, knowing that this virus can only be eliminated if we agree to play our part. “This call becomes more pertinent as we go fully into the rainy season that ordinarily brings with it cold, catarrh and other COVID-19 mimicking illnesses. Our call to take personal responsibility cannot be more strident than now. “As we go forward, therefore, let us look forward to another three months of overwhelming successes, let us create awareness and sensitization, stop the stigmatisation of survivors and let’s encourage fellow citizens that have contracted the virus to enable them to overcome the illness.
