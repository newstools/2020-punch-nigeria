Kelvin Ekerete Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, says he is excited and relieved after extending his loan deal at the club until January 31, 2021. Ighalo, who joined the Red Devils from Chinese side, Shanghai Shenhua, on January transfer deadline day, hit the ground running, finding the back of the net four times in eight appearances before the suspension of football in Europe due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Ighalo’s contract at United had expired on May 31 but an agreement was reached between both clubs on June 1 to extend his deal with the striker. In an interview with MUTV Group Chat, Ighalo says he is buzzing at extending his deal at the club. “I’m really happy,” he said. “It’s a dream for me to be here. I’m buzzing and ready to go. “I feel okay. The last few days have been difficult as there have been different talks about it but now I’m really happy so I need to concentrate fully. I’m here until the end of January, so it’s good for me. “I decided I want to stay and I’m happy. Since the first day I arrived, I made it clear that I wanted whatever it takes to continue that work. It was very difficult, there were some talks, but I’m happy they finally agreed and got everything done. Everything is official now. “I’m sending thanks to the Shanghai president and director for the support because they know this is what I want. So, I’m thanking them and I’m happy that this has happened. They wish me all the best too,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
