Raphael Ede, Enugu There is tension at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Enugu as over 25 doctors, nurses and other non-health workers were asked to go into isolation for 14 days after a nurse tested positive for coronavirus. A doctor working at the hospital told The PUNCH on condition of anonymity that a staff nurse had tested positive to COVID-19 some days back. He said, “We suspected that she contracted COVID-19 from her husband who was said to have tested positive to the virus. So, on Monday, we were asked to go into 14-day isolation.” The State Chairman, Nigerian Medical Association, Dr Ike Okwesili, warned that more hospitals in the state could be affected.
