Nike Popoola The Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria has said it is developing corporate governance guidelines on specific requirements relevant to sectors not covered under the Nigerian Code of Corporate Governance 2018. The FRC disclosed this in a report on its website on, titled ‘Guidance for reporting on compliance with the Nigerian Code of Corporate Governance 2018.’ Referring to some of the provisions in the NCCG 2018, it said, “The implementation of this code will be monitored by the FRC through the sectoral regulators and registered exchanges who are empowered to impose appropriate sanctions based on the specific deviation noted and the company in question. “In consonance with the relevant regulatory agencies of the Federal Government of Nigeria, the council will subsequently issue corporate governance guidelines to assist implementation as may be required to respond to prudential considerations in different sectors of the economy.” The FRC added, “In furtherance of this, the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria has been engaging with all sector regulators, for the purpose of developing sectoral guidelines of corporate governance on specific requirements relevant to each sector which is not covered under NCCG 2018.” According to the report, the process is important because all existing sectoral codes of corporate governance are to be withdrawn, and sectoral guidelines of corporate governance will be issued to address sector-specific matters or requirements on corporate governance.
