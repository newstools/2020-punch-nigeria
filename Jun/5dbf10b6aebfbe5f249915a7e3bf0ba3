Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has said that former governor Abiola Ajimobi and some of his key cabinet members have yet to be dragged before the state’s anti-graft agency due to bureaucratic bottlenecks. Makinde spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, while featuring on a political interview programme tagged: ‘South-West Political Circuit,’ on Fresh 105.9 FM, on Saturday. Makinde’s administration established the Oyo State Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in the sixth month of his government. However, the agency has yet to commence activities. Adisa, who was on air alongside Babatunde Oduyoye, the Special Adviser on Politics and Strategy to the Governor, explained that government procedures were long and jumping any stage could jeopardise the entire process. He said, “The government has detailed information on infractions committed by officials of the past administration in the state, but the appointment of members of the anti-corruption agency and its inauguration will not be hasty.” On the friction threatening the coalition that led to Makinde’s victory in the 2019 election, Oduyoye said there was no cause for worry as efforts were on to address the impasse. He said the governor would not, under any guise, shove aside those who contributed to his electoral victory, adding, “One of the things we wanted to do on assumption of office was to reconcile the parties.” Copyright PUNCH.
