A representative should uphold the interest of the people he represents above his personal ones. If he cannot afford to do that, he is not worth to be given the mandate. “The demand and aspiration, pain and agony, needs and wants of the people of Katagum is pitiable because of the senator’s gross misconduct and failure to table it where it matters most – the Senate chamber. “Senator Bulkachuwa has disappeared into thin air, evidently deserted his constituency for over six months now, no iconic presence or project from him is sighted in his constituency all this while.” The party also alleged that the lawmaker is yet to employ legislative aides despite the fact that every serving senator is empowered to employ five personal staff, thereby leaving his teeming supporters jobless.
