Oladimeji Ramon An Ondo State Peoples Democratic Party governorship aspirant, Eyitayo Jegede (SAN), has called for fairness and justice in the choice of the party’s standard bearer for this year’s governorship election. Jegede, who was the PDP candidate in the 2016 governorship election in Ondo State, said while he had no problem with defectors who are now returning to the PDP, those who stayed behind must be rewarded for their loyalty. A statement on Sunday by a former Ondo State Commissioner for the Environment, Chief Lebi Adepiti, quoted Eyitayo as urging the leadership of the party to let the wish of the people prevail. He said, “Some people abandoned the party; people like me did not jump ship. We stayed back, rebuilt and reorganised the party. “Thank goodness that our efforts paid off. Despite ‘federal might’ and all their manipulations, we secured two senatorial seats and half of the House of Representatives seats in the 2019 general elections. We even beat them hands down in the presidential election in the state. “The same people who deployed ‘federal might’ against us then are now running to us! “We are waxing stronger and I admonish our members and leaders to allow the will of party members who are rooting for me, to be freely expressed during the coming primary.” Copyright PUNCH.
