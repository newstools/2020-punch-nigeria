James Abraham, Jos The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Jos, Prof. Sebastian Maimako, says without the assistance of the Federal Government, it will be difficult for universities to meet the conditions outlined for the reopening of schools amidst COVID-19 pandemic. FG had on Tuesday sent a document to the National Assembly detailing guidelines and conditions to be met by schools and learning facilities preparatory to their reopening after being shut for over three months. Among the conditions recommended was that schools should have temporary isolation spaces and fully-equipped clinics. Other conditions include the provision of more classrooms and the employment of more teachers, amongst others.

Maimako said, “We want our students to return to the classrooms but we have the challenge of meeting these conditions before the schools would be allowed to reopen. That is why we are appealing to the Federal Government to assist the universities in this regard so that students can resume their normal studies.”
