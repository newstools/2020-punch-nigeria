Kelvin Meluwa, Warri The suspected kidnappers of a resident doctor at the Ojobo General Hospital, Burutu Local Government Area of Delta State, Wisdom Iboyitete, have reportedly contacted the victim’s family and demanded N5m ransom. Community sources made the disclosure to our correspondent on Wednesday. PUNCH Metro gathered that the kidnappers had earlier demanded N10m but reduced it to N5m. Iboyitete, a principal medical officer, was kidnapped on the hospital premises and whisked to an unknown destination on Monday by the gunmen. A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “The abductors established contact with the victim’s family on Tuesday. “The leaders of the community are still pleading for the unconditional release of the medical practitioner. “The gunmen pretended to be patients seeking medical help and escaped with the doctor through the creeks in the Ijaw riverside community.” Medical practitioners in the state had declared a two-day warning strike to protest Iboyitete’s kidnap. The warning strike took effect on Tuesday. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
