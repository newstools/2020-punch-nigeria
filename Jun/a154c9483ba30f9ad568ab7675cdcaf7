Friday Olokor, Abuja A former Executive Director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr. Ado Muhammad, has advised the Federal Government to deploy polio infrastructure to contain the community transmission of COVID-19 in the country. He also suggested that the infrastructure should be used to strengthen routine immunisation and health systems towards the attainment of universal health care for all residents of Nigeria. Muhammad, who is the Global Director (Health and Social Protection) for D-8 Countries Organisation for Economic Cooperation, made the recommendations in a statement to congratulate Nigeria on the wild polio-free status. He said, “Going forward, we should deploy the huge polio infrastructure to contain community transmission of COVID – 19 as well as strengthen routine immunisation and health systems towards the attainment of universal health care for all residents of Nigeria. “Congratulations, Nigerians as we are on the verge of being declared a polio-free nation following the attainment of the historic non- polio-endemic status in 2015. I join other past CEOs, former ministers of health, as well as pioneers of polio eradication initiative in Nigeria to celebrate this milestone. “I am particularly delighted that the zero polio case achieved in 2014 was sustained which is the foundation for certification. I commend the polio emergency operation centres which we established in 2013 for the strategic coordination of the programme which has now become the model for epidemic response across Africa. “I congratulate the government, traditional and religious leaders, staff and management of NPHCDA and all partners on this day.” Copyright PUNCH.
