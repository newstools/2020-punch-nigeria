Dayo Ojerinde Apublic health physician, Dr Laz Eze, has said the lack of Personal Protective Equipment may be killing more Nigerians than COVID-19. Eze, who is also the convener of #MakeOurHospitalWork Campaign, in a statement, said some Nigerians lost their lives due to restriction of movement during the lockdown period. “Over the past three weeks, I have been inundated with calls and social media messages from relatives of patients who were denied medical care or whose care has become irregular due to COVID-19 regulations. During the total lockdown, reports of movement restrictions against patients and health workers by law enforcement agents were common. At present, the rejection of seriously–ill patients is apparently at an epidemic level. “The lack of PPE is also costing lives. This has caused the life of Wisdom – a young man I know personally. He was knocked down two weeks ago by a vehicle in Lagos and was reportedly taken to the General Hospital, Isolo. He was conscious after the accident and suspected to have had a fracture. He lost apparently so much blood, became breathless and was asking for oxygen. He didn’t get needed help and had to move to another hospital. Before a serious intervention could happen, he died,” Eze said. The public health physician urged the federal and state governments to address the shortage of PPEs in order to win the battle against COVID-19. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
