Tukur Muntari, Kano THE Chairman, Kano State branch of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Kabiru Minjibir, has cautioned against any attempt to slash the salaries of workers in the country. Minjibir, who gave the warning in a telephone interview with The PUNCH in Kano on Wednesday, said any attempt to reduce the workers’ salaries would be met with stiff resistance from the workers in the country. The NLC boss, who was reacting to the advice given to Federal and state governments by the lawmaker representing Borno South in the Senate, Mohammed Ali Ndume, to slash the salaries of workers, described the advice by the lawmaker as ill-timed considering the situation in the country. Recall that Ndume was said to have advised both Federal and state governments to cut the salaries of workers to enable them to execute capital projects. “It is not the right time for the lawmaker to give such advice because it’s not the right time to reduce workers’ salaries as they are not being given any palliative. “Since workers are not being given palliatives, their salaries should not be tampered with,” Minjibir further cautioned. On the ultimatum the NLC gave to Kano State Government to refund deductions from its members’ salaries or face strike action, Minjibir said the deadline given to government would expire on Monday, June 15, 2020. He said the committee set up by the state government under the leadership of the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Usman Alhaji, had met twice with state NLC representatives with a view to resolving the issue amicably..
