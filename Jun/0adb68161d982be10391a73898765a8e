Nike Popoola The Federal Government has said a modern Boeing 737-NG Full Flight Simulator has arrived in the country and is currently at the seaport undergoing Customs clearance process. The Minister of Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika, disclosed this during a television programme, while analysing the strides of Nigeria’s aviation industry in the last five years. The FFS, which is expected to curb capital flight, will be installed at the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology in Zaria, Kaduna State. A simulator for training and retraining is one major hindrance the aviation industry is facing, costing it millions in foreign exchange as pilots had to travel out for recurrence exercises. Sirika stated, “As we speak, the simulator is at the seaport in Lagos, we are clearing it. The housing component which would house the sim has been built and it will be on its way to Zaria for installation.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
