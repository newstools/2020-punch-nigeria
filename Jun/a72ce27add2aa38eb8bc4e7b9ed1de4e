Daud Olatunji Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Friday, suspended the planned reopening of the religious centres in the state. The governor said he changed his plan as earlier promised following the increase in the cases of coronavirus in the state. Abiodun had earlier fixed June 19 for the planned reopening of the worship centres in the state and had set up a tripartite committee to work out the modalities for the reopening.
