Matthew Ochei, Asaba A 70-bed isolation centre has been sited at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba by the Delta State Government following the rising cases of COVID-19 pandemic in the state. The Secretary to the Delta State Government, Mr Chiedu Ebie, and the Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr Mordi Ononye, on Tuesday, inspected the readiness of the isolation centre to receive patients. They expressed confidence that the state was prepared in case of an upsurge in cases. Ebie said, “We resolved to provide isolation facilities across the state and this project was started about four weeks ago and will be put into use any moment from now as almost all the equipment needed are in place. “With the manner with which the virus is spreading, government cannot handle it alone and corporate organisations and well meaning individuals have come to render assistance, NNPC/AGIP came together and galvanised other oil companies to provide these facilities. “Deltans can be safer if they obey established health protocols because it is our prayers not to have more patients in the state, and for those in the isolation centres to get well and be discharged.” Also, Dr Ononye disclosed that the isolation centre has comprehensive health facilities, including accommodation for the patients and caregivers. He stated that COVID-19 was not a death sentence, especially with early detection, disclosing that the deaths so far recorded in the state was as a result of the victims having prevailing health challenges that were compounded by COVID-19.
