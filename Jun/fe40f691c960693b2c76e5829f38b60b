Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, on Thursday, ordered the immediate quarantine of a former Information Commissioner in the state, Abia Onyike, for allegedly violating the COVID-19 lockdown rules in the state. The governor stated this while giving an update on COVID-19 in the state at the Government House, Abakaliki, on Thursday. Onyike, who allegedly came into the state from an unknown destination, visited his village in the Afikpo South Local Government Area, where he was reportedly barred from entering by the Caretaker Chairman, Okechukwu Chima. He was said to have proceeded to an undisclosed residence in Abakaliki, the state capital, where he took abode. Umahi, during the briefing, directed the Department of State Security to immediately ensure that the former commissioner was quarantined for 14 days.

Umahi explained, ” We continue to appeal to our people to ensure that if you come from outside, that you will submit yourself to NCDC protocols. “I am told by one of the Chairmen that Abia Onyike came from outside into the state, and the chairman is insisting that he should not be allowed into the village. “But he is in another place which is in the capital city, which is also dangerous. “So, we are directing the Director, SSS, to take him at his property, and ensure he is tested for COVID-19. If he doesn’t have confidence in our testing here in Ebonyi, he should do it in Enugu. But he must compulsorily isolate for 14 days.”
