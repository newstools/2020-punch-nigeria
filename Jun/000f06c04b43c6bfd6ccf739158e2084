Kelvin Ekerete Former Leicester City striker, Emile Heskey, says, Kelechi Iheanacho, is an amazing player but insists he does not have what it takes to replace Jamie Vardy. Iheanacho served as back up to the English striker while injured and scored three league goals and providing four assists in 12 games, but has found his opportunities limited since the return of the former Three Lions star. The Nigeria international was an 83rd-minute substitute for Marc Albrighton in The Foxes 1-1 draw at Watford on Saturday. Reacting to the talent of the Nigerian striker, Heskey, who was speaking in a matchday Premier League Productions, studio said Iheanacho lacks the kind of Vardy’s fire in games. “Iheanacho has come in and done very well but he doesn’t have that fire in his belly like what Jamie Vardy does. “When you look at Leicester, without Jamie Vardy it doesn’t tick as well. They understand what runs he wants to make. They understand where he wants the ball and you know he’s a finisher.” Despite failing to score in the Foxes draw on Saturday, Vardy is the league’s top scorer this season with 19 goals from 27 appearances.
