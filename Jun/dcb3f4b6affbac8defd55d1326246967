Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State deputy  governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi on Sunday resigned his membership of the ruling All Progressives Congress in Apoi  Ward 2, Ese Odo Local Government Area of the state. Ajayi said although he had left the APC, he was still the deputy governor of the state, adding that he would not resign his position. “My people that voted for me did not ask me to resign, so I remain the deputy governor of this state.

Tendering his resignation letter at the APC secretariat in Apoi Ward 2, Ese Odo Local Government Area, Ajayi said everybody knew why he left the APC. He said, “The reason I am taking this action is known to all of you. I listen to the advise from all supporters across the state.  The Ese Odo Local Government will continue to witness peace and progress.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
