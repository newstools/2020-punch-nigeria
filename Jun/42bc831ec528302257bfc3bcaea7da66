A former Senator representing Lagos Central Senatorial District, Muniru Muse, is dead. The Senator, who until his death was a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, died on Tuesday, after a brief illness. It was gathered that Muse, who was also a former chairman of the Apapa Local Government Area of Lagos state, died at the Ahmadiyya Hospital in Apapa, where he was admitted on May 30. He was 81years. The Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, expressed sadness over the news. Sanwo-Olu, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Gboyega Akosile, said, “For us, this is broken news because the late former federal lawmaker passed away at a time his wealth of experience in corporate administration and political leadership was desired to guide our steps towards taking our dear state to another level of development. “On behalf of my family and the good people of Lagos, I commiserate with the family of the late distinguished man, Senator Munir Muse.” The National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, also commiserated with Muse family. In a condolence message issued by his media office, on Tuesday, Tinubu said, “Senator Muse was an associate who was part of our administration in Lagos State in 1999 as Chairman of the Apapa Local Government Area. “He was very committed and dedicated to the development of not only his Apapa constituency, but also of Lagos State and Nigeria. He later served diligently as Senator representing Lagos Central from 2007 to 2011. “A loyal party man and stabilising factor in Lagos politics, his contributions to the Action Congress and later the All Progressives Congress were invaluable.”
