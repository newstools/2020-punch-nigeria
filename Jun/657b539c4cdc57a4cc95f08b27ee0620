The Kebbi State Emergency Management Agency has alerted chairmen of 11 local government areas that are flood-prone in the state, to brace for possible disaster. The Executive Chairman of the agency, Alhaji Sani Dododo, gave the warning at a meeting with the council chairmen in Birnin Kebbi on Wednesday. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the 11 areas likely to be affected are Birnin Kebbi, Ngaski, Yauri, Koko/Besse, Argungu, Dandi, Bagudo, Bunza, Augie, Shanga and Zuru LGs. Dododo said that against the 2020 seasonal rainfall prediction  by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, “it is necessary to caution the LGAs to prepare against the possibilities of destruction due to windstorm and heavy rainfall this year.” “There is the need for the LGAs and state, especially SEMA to put all the necessary mitigating measures in place before the onset of the flood season,’’ he said. Dododo also urged the chairmen to come up with precautionary measures, like tree planting, reduce the erosion that could lead to flooding. The Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Alhaji Hassan Muhammad-Shalla, enjoined the chairmen to begin stockpiling relief materials for unforeseen disaster. Copyright PUNCH.
