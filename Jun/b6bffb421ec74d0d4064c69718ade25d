The court agreed with their arguments and declared their suspension as null and void and of no effect.

While the embattled lawmakers, argued that their suspension was a contravention of the African Charter on Human and Peoplesâ€™ Rights, the Speaker, Kano State House of Assembly, on the other hand, prayed the court to dismiss the request of the plaintiffs. The counsel to the defendants, M.N. Duru prayed the court not to grant the prayers of the plaintiffs, which the presiding judge, Justice Lewis Allagoa, upheld and granted the prayers sought by the suspended lawmakers. Justice Allagoa, in her ruling, said the suspension of the lawmakers was a deprivation of their rights to participate freely in the affairs of the state. Also, she directed Kano State House of Assembly and the Speaker of the House to pay the withheld entitlements of the suspended lawmakers forthwith.
