Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government will complete 22 major roads in 2020 and 2021, the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, said on Thursday. Fashola also stated that Nigeria was currently constructing a bridge to link the country with Cameroon. The minister who spoke in a live television programme monitored by our correspondent in Abuja noted that Nigeria lost one year of construction due to the reduction of the national budget in 2017. “But I have good news that we plan to complete 22 major roads between this year 2020 and 2021 because clearly this is delivery time and we’ve lost about three good dry (season) months due to COVID-19. “However, we remain hopeful that in spite of this, we will deliver on time as our resources permit us to.” Asked to mention the roads, the minister said he could not state all of them off-hand but noted that some major roads in virtually all geopolitical zones would be completed.
