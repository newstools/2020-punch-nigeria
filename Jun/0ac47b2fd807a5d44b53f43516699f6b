Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja The Nigeria Police Force says it has forwarded the alleged rape case of the Senior Pastor of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, Biodun Fatoyinbo, to the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation at the Federal Ministry of Justice. The NPF said this in a letter addressed to Lagos-based photographer, Busola Dakolo, who is also the wife of popular musician, Timi Dakolo. In the letter signed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of Administration at the Force Criminal Investigation Department, the police said the DPP would study the case file and then give advice.

The cleric, however, denied the allegations. The scandal sparked a series of reactions last year which led to the pastor stepping down for several weeks.
