Benin Electricity Distribution Company is set to implement a new service reflective tariff structure on Wednesday, July 1. The company in a statement on Monday said the move would ensure improved service to customers. It said the new tariff was based on customer feedback following consultations conducted with residents earlier in the year on the proposed tariff review. The power distribution firm assured customers of a new tariff regime that would guarantee power availability for a stated minimum of hours. The company said, “Under this new tariff structure, customers are to be disaggregated into various tariff bands based on these guaranteed hours of service with those with more power paying more than those with less power. “The new tariff regime also provides that customers can move to upper bands of more power availability as their quality of service improves.” It promised to provide better services in the future by strengthening its customer care centre and closing the metering gap.
