This emphasises the ability to self-isolate in a single room with convenience for that individual, absence of co-morbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. In addition, there should not be any person in the household with co-morbidities. “The state should also make available health care workers to monitor the patients’ treatment at home. Meanwhile, the Federal Ministry of Health and her agencies including the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency and the NCDC as well as relevant development partners are exploring various available options for expansion of supervised isolation. “Discussions are at an advanced stage with high burden states for decentralisation of isolation and case management to the community through the establishment of community support centres which will be state-led and community-driven in line with approved guidelines and infection prevention and control protocols.”
