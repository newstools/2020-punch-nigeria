Secondus, however, declared that the deputy governor, who has also indicated interest in contesting the governorship election, would not be imposed on other aspirants of the party. Ajayi defected to the PDP on Sunday. The PDP national chairman, who spoke at the party secretariat in Akure on Monday, while welcoming  Ajayi and other 34 defectors from the All Progressives Congress, said the PDP would take over the state after the election. He said, “The APC has damaged the security and the economy of the Nigeria. Everybody has seen that the APC is taking us to nowhere. I believe Ajayi is coming to the PDP to add value and to make difference. “We in the PDP do believe the constitution of the country and the constitution of our party. We are one family. Ajayi is not coming to alter any rule. There would be free and fair primary. Everybody has equal right in the party. We are not going to impose any aspirant on others because our target is to take over the state.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
