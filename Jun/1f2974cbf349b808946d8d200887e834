Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Ghanaian authorities have ordered the arrest of the individuals who carried out the demolition of a building on the premises of the Nigerian High Commission in Accra. The President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, was said to have ordered that a severe action should be taken against them, including arrest. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, disclosed this during a briefing by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja on Monday. The building which was under construction was meant for the accommodation of the mission staff and visiting diplomats to the High Commission. It was partially demolished by a Ghanaian businessman who claimed that the mission encroached on his land. Onyeama, who had earlier summoned the Chargè d’ Affaires of the High Commission of Ghana to Nigeria, Ms Iva Denoo, said on Monday that  the Ghanaian President assured that the matter would be resolved. He said, “The (Ghanaian) foreign minister went today (Monday) with officials of the Nigerian High Commission to the land registry because it appears there are some people who are claiming that they have legitimate title to that piece of land. “The message I received directly from the minister of foreign affairs was that everything would be sorted out and that the President has directed that a very severe action be taken against those who are responsible for that including immediate arrest and they would be coming out with a definitive statement.” Copyright PUNCH.
