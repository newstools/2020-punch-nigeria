The national electricity grid collapsed on Tuesday, a development that threw many parts of the country into blackout for hours. But the Transmission Company of Nigeria stated that it restored about 90 per cent of the power system, adding that the grid would be fully restored in due course. It was learnt that the grid collapsed around 11am on Tuesday, while a total of 2,774.9 megawatts of electricity was generated on the grid as of 6am the same day. “The time of the system disturbance is 11:13Hrs of 2/06/2020. Restoration is ongoing and is over 90 per cent complete,” an impeccable source at the transmission company told our correspondent in Abuja. The TCN official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not immediately state the reason for the grid collapse. “The situation is still being assessed and actions are being taken to fully restore the grid in order to get power across all parts of the country,” the official stated. A study of the country’s latest power generation performance figures showed that a peak generation of 4,785.4Mw was recorded on Monday. An off-peak generation figure of 3,016.4MW was also recorded the same day. Further findings showed that power generation on the grid at about 6am on Tuesday was 2,774.9MW, meaning that the grid crashed from around this figure. It was gathered that the 2,774.9MW was 965.6MW lower than the lowest power generation figure that was recorded the previous day. Nigeria’s power grid has been recording collapses over time. It experienced four collapses in the fourth quarter of 2019.
