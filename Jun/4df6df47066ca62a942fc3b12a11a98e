Amobi Friday, Port Harcourt SEVEN health workers on COVID-19 duties in Rivers State have tested positive to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Association of Resident Doctors in the state, which disclosed this in Port Harcourt on Wednesday, pleaded that Governor Nyesom Wike should fulfill his promise of increasing the hazard allowances for frontline workers fighting the disease in the state by 50 per cent of their basic salaries. Chairman of the association, Rivers State Teaching Hospital branch, Dr. Josephine Sokolo,  explained that health workers were predisposed to health risk that could render them and their families bankrupt without life insurance, hence the need for a health insurance scheme for them. She said, “We have seven health workers infected and they are being treated now. In fact, two days ago, a doctor in another state died out of COVID-19 complications. “The governor should increase the hazard allowances of healthcare workers to 50 per cent of their basic salaries. He should put in place a life insurance policy so that in case anything happens to any health worker, their families won’t be rendered bankrupt.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
