Manchester United are considering loaning out Dan James in the summer but will offer him a new bumper deal ahead of next season, reports the Sun on Sunday. James has been a regular for United in his first Premier League season since joining from Swansea last year, Skysports reports. However, United have stepped up their interest in Ajax midfielder Donny Van de Beek, according to The Sunday Times. The newspaper reports fellow suitors Real Madrid may not be able to stump up the funds to complete a Â£49m move this summer due to the financial impact of the coronavirus.
