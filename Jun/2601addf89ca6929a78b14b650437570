Maiharaji Altine, Gusau The Nigerian Army said it had killed the Zamfara bandits’ notorious leader, Hassan Dan Tagwaye, and his twin brother, Husaini. Dan Tagwaye had granted an interview to Saturday PUNCH published in August 17, 2019 where he confessed that, “We decided to kill 50 people for every slain herdsman.” Dan Tagawaye was among the bandits granted amnesty by the state government last year. A statement by the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Major General John Ehenche, to journalists in Gusau on Friday, revealed that the bandits’ leader and his twin brother were killed in Domboru forest in the Zurmi Local Government Area of the state. Apart from the twins, many bandits were said to have been neutralised in air strikes carried out on June 23. The air component reportedly dispatched an enhanced force package of fighter jets and gunships to attack a location where many bandits assembled for a meeting. The statement read, “The attack aircraft engaged the target structures, scoring accurate hits and taking out the huts along with their occupants. The NAF jets also later recorded direct hits on the suspected bunker from where some of the bandits were seen emerging, completely destroying it”. “Intelligence reports later confirmed that Hassan Tagwaye, leader of the bandits and his twin brother Hussain, along with several other bandits were neutralised in the air strikes, while a few escaped with injuries.” The statement urged the public to continue to assist the military with credible information in its efforts to rid the state of banditry.
