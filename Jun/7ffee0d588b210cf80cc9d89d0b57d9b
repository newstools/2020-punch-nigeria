Sodiq Oyeleke Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof Akin Abayomi, says the state requires not less than 260,000 units of blood annually to meet with the growing blood transfusion demand at health facilities in the state. A statement from that Lagos Ministry of Health on Sunday quoted the commissioner as saying this during the Zoom Live Feeds organised by the Lagos State Blood Transfusion Service to commemorate the 2020 World Blood Donor Day in Lagos. Abayomi noted that efforts were being intensified by the government to meet and surpass the requirement through recruiting and retaining voluntary blood donors. He said, “To maintain an adequate blood supply, one to two percent of the population needs to become regular blood donors; this is about 260,000 in a growing population of over 26 million in Lagos state. The regular supply of blood is essential as the life span of blood is very short. READ ALSO: Africa’s COVID-19 cases exceed 230,000 – WHO “Each unit of blood donated remains viable for 35days.
