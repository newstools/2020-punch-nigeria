Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State House of Assembly on Monday said it would soon invite a former governor, Ayodele Fayose, to give account of decisions taken with respect to state finances during his administration. The Assembly said a committee had been set up to discuss Fayose’s   invitation with respect to the N10bn supplementary budget passed 30 days to his exit from office on October 15, 2018. The Chairman, House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Yemisi Ayokunle, said this while speaking on the first year in office of the sixth Ekiti Assembly. In response to a question whether Fayose had been invited, he said, “We didn’t invite him, but we were about discussing his issue when he (Fayose) came in here as a meddlesome interloper.” He said under the year under review, the assembly passed 19 out of the 25 bills presented before it by the executive in addition to carrying out other oversight functions. Recall Fayose last year stormed the Assembly complex in December 2019, saying he was there to clarify issues after news spread that he was being invited. He was however resisted by the lawmakers. Earlier, the House under the leadership of the Speaker, Funminiyi Afuye, passed a motion mandating the executive to rename Ekiti State Civic Centre under construction as John Kayode Fayemi Cultural Centre.
