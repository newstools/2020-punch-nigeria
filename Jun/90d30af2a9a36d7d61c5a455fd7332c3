Kelvin Ekerete Ex-Super Eagles forward, Osaze Odemwingie, has revealed plans to go into coaching in the near future. Osaze, who turned to golf after announcing his retirement from football in 2019, obtained a golf coaching badge in December 2019 and has also registered for a higher coaching course. But the former Lille and Stoke City star says he is considering going into football management. “In about three to four years, I would like to become a football coach,” the former player said in an Instagram live session monitored by our correspondent. “At the moment the plan is to spend as much time as possible with my kids. I travelled a lot during my career and didn’t get to spend as much time with them as I would have wanted, but now I’m enjoying being a dad. “Now I’m into golf because that gives me the knowledge about other sports and the knowledge I need about football coaching but for now, I’m focusing on golf because I have a genuine passion for it.” The former Bendel Insurance player also revealed his desire to go into football administration. “Golf is my priority now but football is a plan B for me. Hopefully, I can get one degree in management, that can help me in the administrative circle for the federation in the future. The more ammunition you have, the better,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
