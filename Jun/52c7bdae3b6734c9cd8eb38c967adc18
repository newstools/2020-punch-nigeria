Narrating the experience, Asue said, “Ibidun’s mom had been working on a house that she wanted to give Ibidun on her 40th birthday. So, she took my hand and showed me the house. “She said, ‘Uncle Asue, I want you to see the house. I was going to give this key to you to give Ituah on the 18th so that Ituah will give her on the 19th. I needed to show my daughter how much I truly loved her.’ And she took me to the house, the house nearly completed in her Estate.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that celebrity photographer, TY Bello, revealed that the late ex-Beauty Queen planned to mark her 40th birthday next month by helping 40 couples to have their babies.
