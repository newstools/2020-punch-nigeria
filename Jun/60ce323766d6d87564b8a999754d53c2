Samson Folarin The Lagos State Safety Commission has said the Register-to-Open initiative of the state government will soon begin in preparation to reopen the economy. The Director General of the agency, Mr Lanre Mojola, said in line with the directives of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the guidelines towards reopening of the economy, especially religious and social centres, had been developed and consultation was ongoing with all stakeholders. In a statement on Sunday, the safety commission boss said upon registration, a verification process would be carried out to ensure adequate space management was in place across the various centres to guarantee that social distancing, hygiene and safety measures were maintained across all religious and social centres. “A committee has been set up by Mr Governor, headed by the Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, Engr. Tayo Bamgbose-Martins, consisting of other ministries, including the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture; Home Affairs; Physical Planning and Urban Renewal; Economic Planning and Budget; to ensure that the process  is done effortlessly. “The commission has met with various stakeholders in the hospitality and tourism sector and will be engaging more stakeholders in the coming week on the best approach to the gradual reopening of the economy and registration of entities within the various sectors,” Mojola said in the statement. He noted that the process was not tedious, adding that all religious and event centres, gyms, night clubs, bars, lounges, spars, cinemas, restaurants, were taken into recognition. Copyright PUNCH.
