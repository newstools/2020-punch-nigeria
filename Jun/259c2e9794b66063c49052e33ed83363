Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Osun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has advised the immediate past governor of the state, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, to admit he failed in his tenure in the state. The party in a statement on Sunday signed by Sunday Bisi, its Publicity Secretary,  in reaction to the virtual colloquium held to mark Aregbesola’s 63rd birthday, said the measured assets on the ground in the state were far below the quantum of the loans accessed by the former governor. The PDP also alleged that the loans obtained by the administration were above collateral size of the state. “It is therefore painful enough that a state would continue to suffer consequences of massive corruption of some political expansionists. “But it is more painful when some  non-residents of the state, who share no iota of pain and bear no burden imposed by activities of their friend, come out to spin narratives suggesting that the suffering populace of Osun should go and die from Aregbesola’s wilful inadequacies,” the party said.
