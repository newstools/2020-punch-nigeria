Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta OGUN State Government said the crisis it had with some official cooks of the Federal Government Homegrown School Feeding Programme, led to the suspension of the programme in the state. The government had suspended the programme since December following the issues it had with some cooks employed by the former administration. State Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Femi Ogunbanwo,   disclosed this on Thursday in Abeokuta. Ogunbanwo told journalists during a Media Day for ‘Take Home Rations distribution’, that the government had no choice but to discontinue the programme so as to resolve the issues with the cooks. The Commissioner explained that some cooks that were employed for the programme were responsible for the major setback that led to the suspension. The commissioner, however, said the issues surrounding the suspension had been totally resolved. He said, “We have issues in the Homegrown School Feeding Programme in the state, but they have been resolved. There are some new cooks that were boarded and once you have cooks, they must be trained and that is what we have done. “You know they are dealing with school children and they must be well trained, medically examined, but all those ones have been resolved and we don’t have issues again.” Copyright PUNCH.
