Wale Oyewale, Ibadan There was pandemonium in the Alaja community, Moniya, Akinyele Local Government Area of Oyo State, on Monday, when a woman, Mrs Adeola Bamidele, and her daughter, Dolapo, were attacked by yet-to-be-identified assailants. It was gathered that Adeola, 45, and her 23-year-old daughter were asleep when the hoodlums broke into their home around 1am. The hoodlums reportedly made away with two mobile telephones after dealing the victims with machete blows. The mother and daughter sustained deep cuts on their heads. It was gathered that the assailants had earlier visited a nearby house, but left as they could not gain entry into the building. Adeola explained that she was attacked with a machete, while trying to rescue her daughter, who had already collapsed and was wreathing in the pool of her own blood. Dolapo was unable to talk as a result of the head injury, but her mother explained that they were helped to hospital by neighbours. It was learnt that the Alaja Community Landlords’ Association had reported the incident at the Moniya Police Division. The residents urged security agencies in the state to be alive to their responsibility in order to avert a re-occurrence of the incident. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Olugbenga Fadeyi, said police personnel were deployed in the scene from the Moniya Police Division, but the hoodlums had fled the scene before their arrival. “The victims have been taken to hospital for treatment, while investigation has since commenced into the matter,” he stated.
