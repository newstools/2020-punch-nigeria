Wale Oyewale The Oyo State Government has sealed five private health facilities in the Saki and Ibadan areas of the state over alleged contravention of recommended and standard practices. The state task force on private health facilities, headed by the Commissioner for Health, Basiru Bello, shut down the facilities on account of the engagement of quacks as medical personnel; use of unapproved premises; and failure on the part of the proprietors to adhere to other rules guiding the medical profession. The commissioner, who expressed concern over the attitude of the proprietors said the government would not tolerate charlatans in the sector. He said the state would promote good practices with a view to ensuring quality health care delivery.

They are not qualified. The environment is not good, no scientific orientation; they are just doing what they like and people’s lives are in danger. “When we went to Saki the other time, one of them was using a room where people live. As we know that one of the pillars of this present administration is health, we are not compromising this. We need to move and make sure our people are well taken care of by qualified personnel, with good facilities.”
