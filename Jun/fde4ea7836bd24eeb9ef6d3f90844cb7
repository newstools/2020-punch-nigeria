Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, on Monday said despite the leadership crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress, the party remained a solid one. Bello said this in an interview with State House correspondents shortly after joining other state governors from the North Central to meet with the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He expressed the confidence that the party would emerge from the crisis bigger and more united. He said, “Our party is one solid party. In a particular big family like that, you won’t rule out any misunderstanding in one way or the other. But I can assure you that our party is strong under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari and as a father, he is already looking into it and I can assure you that we are going to come out very strong. “We are going to go to Edo State and we shall win the Edo State election overwhelmingly for the APC. We are going to go to Ondo State and win it overwhelmingly for the APC. We will take Anambra State and record it as a second APC state from the South- East and integrate our Igbo brothers into the fold and we are going to take Ekiti and Osun once again.” Copyright PUNCH.
