The Chairman, Nigerian Insurers Association, Mr Tope Smart, disclosed this during the association’s first virtual and 49th annual general meeting in Lagos on Thursday. He said, “The volume of business written by the market grew from N413.8bn in 2018 to about N490bn in 2019. “This represents an increase of 15.55 per cent over 2018 figure.” Despite the challenges in the economy, he said, the insurance industry continued to perform its role of financial intermediation and business restoration in line with its mandate.

The chairman mentioned the initiatives to include financial inclusion, micro-insurance, the insurance industry rebranding project, the association’s USSD initiative, and the Nigerian insurance industry platform for sale of third party motor insurance.
