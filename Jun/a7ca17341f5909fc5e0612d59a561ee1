Maiharaji Altine, Gusau The police in Lagos have arrested two armed robbery suspects, Sule Karimu and Joseph Celestine, who claimed to be dispatch riders. A reliable source told the News Agency of Nigeria that the suspects were arrested in a Uber car around 9.30pm on Thursday by men of the Anthony Police Division on a stop-and-search operation led by the Divisional Police Officer, SP Patricia Amadin. It was gathered that the vehicle was stopped in front of a commercial bank on Anthony Village Road. All the occupants of the car were asked to come out for a search during which the arm and ammunition were discovered under the seat of the car. A man alleged to have given them the gun was later arrested at Obalende area after the suspects reportedly confessed to the police. They allegedly worked in a company as dispatch riders. The Lagos State Police spokesman, DSP Bala Elkana, confirmed the arrest, adding that the case had been transferred to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad for further investigation. He said, “Policemen from Anthony Village Police Division, on routine patrol led by the DPO, SP Patricia Amadin, intercepted a Toyota Corolla car with the number plate, KSF257FQ, occupied by three suspicious and uneasy looking adult males. “Upon searching the vehicle, a locally-made pistol with a live cartridge was recovered under the car seat. All the three occupants and the vehicle were taken to the station for investigation,” Elkana said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
