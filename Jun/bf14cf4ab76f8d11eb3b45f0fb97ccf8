John Alechenu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress National Vice Chairman (North-East), Mustapha Salihu, has dissociated himself from a fresh court order asking him to take over as the National Secretary of the party. Salihu told reporters in Abuja, on Thursday, that it was impossible for him to be a party to the suit because it contravened the virtual Zonal Executive Council meeting where the appointment of Waziri Bulama, as APC National Secretary was ratified. Salihu said, “My zone, the North East has already nominated Architect Waziri Bulama as the acting national secretary in the presence of the Senate president, APC governors from the zone and other party stakeholders. I was at the meeting where this decision was reached. So why now would I go back following a court order to act as national secretary? “I was not part of such shenanigan. It is not in my character to play such dirty politics and I condemn in strong terms those behind the act. At a time like this when the party is going through trying times, it is such a time that all lovers of the party must pull together to keep the party running.” READ ALSO: Domestic flights can’t resume June 21 – FG An order dated June 16, 2020, obtained from the FCT High Court sitting in Maitama, presided over by Hon Justice S.U.
