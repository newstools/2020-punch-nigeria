He enjoined the general public particularly parents and guardians to be more cautious of the integrity of persons to whom they entrust their children and wards. He warned that any parent or guardian whose child or ward is sent out to hawk will be arrested and prosecuted in line with the provision of section 30 (2C) of the Child’s Rights Act which prohibits the hiring of children for hawking and also prescribes a punishment upon conviction to 10 years imprisonment in section 30(3).
