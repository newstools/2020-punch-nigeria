Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress, South Africa chapter, Dr Taiye Abe, is dead. He was aged 65. The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in a statement on Wednesday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said he received the news of Abe’s death with sadness. Buhari sympathised with the family, friends, and colleagues of the deceased, and urged them to take heart, praying that God will comfort them at this time of sorrow. He recalled many meetings with the deceased on visits to South Africa and remarked that he was a man with an unmistakable love for Nigeria, and a deep commitment to the ideals of the APC. “Dr Abe looked forward to a Nigeria that would take its rightful place among the comity of nations, and passionately believed in a resurgent country we could all be proud of. “We will not relent in working towards that goal,” the President said. He urged members of the APC in South Africa to continue the good work pioneered by Abe, particularly in being worthy ambassadors of the party and their fatherland.
