John Alechenu, Abuja The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, has assured members of the party that the committee would work on short and long term strategies to reposition the party. He made the pledge on Monday in his inaugural address soon after the oath of office was administered on members of the 13-member committee at the APC National Secretariat, Abuja. Buni, who is also the Yobe State governor, said since formation six years ago, Nigerians were attracted to the APC largely due to the sincerity of purpose, principles and integrity of its founding fathers. He said, “Nigerians have trusted and still have the trust in us that the Party will create a country of our dream with a prosperous
future. “As the party trusted by Nigerians, and voted massively for two times in a row, we must shun away from any attempt to distract us from delivering the dividend of democracy to Nigerians.

Internal disagreements are common in all political parties, so ours is not an exception. “lt is time for this committee, therefore, to commence the process of true reconciliation among leaders and members of the party at all levels. It is our belief that the decision by NEC to constitute this committee will mark the beginning of a new chapter in our great Party.”
