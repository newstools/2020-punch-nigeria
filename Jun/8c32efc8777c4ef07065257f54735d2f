Peter Dada, Akure A group within the All Progressives Congress in Ondo State, has raised the alarm over an alleged move by some governorship aspirants to manipulate the party register. The group, lbi Giga Ambassadors, who are loyalists of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, have since petitioned the APC National Secretariat and the National Chairman, Mr Adam Oshiomhole, over the issue. Speaking in Akure on Monday, the Director General of the group, Prof. Lanre Olu-Adeyemi, said, the group was raising the alarm to save the party from the machinations of a few persons bent on reversing the gains made by the Akeredolu-led APC administration. The DG, who was represented by his deputy, Chief Alaba Eniola-Ajipe, alleged that the aspirants had gone to Osun State to collate party membership slips and commenced injecting the fictitious names into the register to favour them in case the party adopted direct primary in July, 2020. The group appealed to the party leadership to quickly address the illegality before it adversely affected the credibility of the party primary scheduled to hold in July 2020 as well as the fortunes of the party in the governorship poll slated for October 2020.
