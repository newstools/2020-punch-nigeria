Iwu said the lawmaker was presently in isolation with his wife, while test had been directed to be conducted on all the state lawmakers. Iwu said, “It is sad that we have registered another death, it is a case of a lady who successfully delivered twins and a positive case from the state House of Assembly.” “This has made us to collect samples from all the lawmakers and their aides.
