Afeez Hanafi The Lagos State Government says it has sealed 34 buildings under construction on Banana Island, Ikoyi, reportedly without building permit. It said the sealing is an ongoing exercise commenced on Wednesday as part of efforts to regulate physical development in the highbrow area and the state at large. Speaking to our correspondent on the telephone on Friday, the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako, said more houses without building permit would be sealed during the ongoing enforcement. He stated, “The exercise continues tomorrow (today). We are not targeting any particular houses. The more we see (without permit), the more we seal. It is not as if we had anybody in mind. We just asked them to show their approval but it is unfortunate we could get that number. It is not limited to Banana Island alone; it is a statewide enforcement programme but we are starting from that area.” The government had announced the development on its Facebook page on Friday, adding that the exercise would engender livable and sustainable environment in the state. “The Lagos State Government, on Thursday, sealed 19 additional buildings in the highbrow Banana Island, Ikoyi. The figure brings the total number of property sealed in the axis for lack of building permit and other infractions of the physical planning law to 34 since the commencement of the exercise on Wednesday,” the post read.
