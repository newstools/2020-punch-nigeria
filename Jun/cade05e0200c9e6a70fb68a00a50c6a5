Wale Oyewale, Ibadan
SOME aggrieved Hausa youths in Sabo community, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, on Monday, protested against the purported plan by some elders in the community to build shops on the access road leading to the Sabo Community Health Centre within the metropolis. The placard-bearing youths, who described the decision as awkward and unacceptable, warned those behind the plan to have a rethink or face the consequences of their action. The protesters gathered in front of the hospital, chanting war songs in Hausa Language, alleging that some elements in the community planned to build shops on the said road in order to generate money with disregard to social welfare. Some of the placards read, ‘We don’t want more shops in this place,’ ‘We want more health centres,’ ‘Unemployment is our problem,’ and ‘Governor Makinde, you are our last hope’. One of the leaders of the youths, Musa Sanni, said, “The shops that they want to build in our area are not needed. How can they think of blocking the only access road to the hospital? “It is the only road in time of emergencies such as when there are medical issues or fire outbreak. It is the only way that leads to the hospital.” However, the councillor representing Sabo community in the Irepodun Local Council Development Area, Ibrahim Faira, said the protest was as a result of misinformation. Faira said, “The World Health Organisation is collaborating with the Irepodun Local Council Development Authority to update the health facility in Sabo community. “There is need to build a standard road with proper setback. Because there are makeshift shops already in the area, there is the plan to build modern shops with appropriate setback from the road.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
