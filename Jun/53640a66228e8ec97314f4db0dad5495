Johnny Edward Lille star Victor Osimhen and two other Super Eagles players Paul Onuachu and Imoh Ezekiel left the Lagos isolation centre on Monday after being quarantined for 14 days, The PUNCH has learnt. The trio was quarantined in line with the guidelines of the government for anyone returning from another country. Osimhen, who lost his father on May 24 after a brief illness, arrived Nigeria with Onuachu and Ezekiel aboard a private jet at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos after he was granted compassionate leave by his French club, Lille. “They (Osimhen, Onuachu, Ezekiel) were released from the isolation centre on Monday,” a close source to the player told our correspondent. Osimhen was voted Lille’s Player of The Season by the French Ligue 1 club following his exploits in his debut season. He scored 18 goals and recorded six assists in 31 appearances before the Ligue 1 season in France was called off due to COVID-19. The 21-year-old, who has been linked with several top European clubs, has four years left on his Lille contract, and the club will be forced to cash in if he continues to attract mammoth offers from teams.
