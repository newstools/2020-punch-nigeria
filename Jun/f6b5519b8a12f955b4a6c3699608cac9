Olushola Odeyinde More reactions have continued to trail the killing ofÂ  Uwaila Omozuwa, an undergraduate of the University of Benin, after she was raped on May 27 by some hoodlums in Benin City, the Edo State capital. The hoodlums were reported to have forced their way into the auditorium of an assembly of the Redeemed Christian Church of God where Omozuwa had gone to study. Her assailants were said to have struck her in the head with a fire extinguisher, violated her, and left her to die. Celebrities like Genevieve Nnaji, Tiwa Savage, Falz, amongst others have since taken to Twitter to lend their voices and demand justice for the victim. See tweets; They either abuse their power or have the power to abuse. In or out of uniform, we live in constant fear of men. Tina Ezekwe. Vera Omozuwa. Rest In Peace my darlings. We will get justice.ðŸŒ¹ðŸ’” pic.twitter.com/e9c4ODcEri â€” Genevieve Nnaji MFR (@GenevieveNnaji1) May 31, 2020
