The firm said in a statement that it was pleased with the government’s efforts in curbing the spread of the virus. It said, “The group has watched with admiration, the federal and state governments’ concerted effort to combat the ravaging effect of the pandemic. “We have therefore brought into the country a total of 1,500,000 face masks worth over $1m as part of our commitment to support the federal government and the states where our group is located.” The group restated its desire to use its corporate social responsibility to help as many states and communities as possible. It also rolled out plans to present health equipment to both Ogun and Lagos state governments on Thursday and Friday as well as other states subsequently.
