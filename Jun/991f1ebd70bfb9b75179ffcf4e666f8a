Enyioha Opara, Minna The Police in Niger State have arrested two suspected fraudsters, who specialised in defrauding unsuspecting members of the public by pretending to assist them to operate automated teller machines in Minna. The suspects, Victor Okebugwu, 32 and James Amaonye, 33, were apprehended by Police Intelligence Operatives on Bank Surveillance in Minna following a tip-off. It was learnt that the suspects’ victims were usually people with ailments or those seeking to make quick money. City Round gathered on Friday that the suspects had been involved in the act for over two years  before their arrest. Checks further revealed that the suspects were noticed to be loitering within the premises of a commercial bank in Minna in a suspicious manner. One of the suspects, Amaonye, said in an interview with our correspondent that he and his accomplice started their trade in Obansanjo Complex, Minna before they decided to relocate to the premises of a commercial bank. He said, “We never knew that the police operatives were monitoring us. We are now convinced that we have ruined our lives. “We moved from one bank to another in Minna defrauding unsuspecting members of the public thinking that we could continue our business as usual. My wife has shown her tremendous support for the business, saying we must survive after all.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Wasiu Abiodun, said the suspects had succeeded in defrauding many people before their arrest.
