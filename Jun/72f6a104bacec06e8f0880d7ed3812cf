Kelvin Ekerete Nigerian boxing heavyweight sensation, Efe Ajagba, has been omitted from Tyson Fury’s list of Top 5 heavyweight boxers in the world. Heavyweight champion Fury, who recently confirmed a double bout with unified heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua in 2021, released his list on Saturday in an interview with Talksport. The British boxer named Ajagba as one of the heavyweight boxers he would love to fight before calling time on his career, but in a ranking made by the Gypsy King, the Nigerian was omitted from his Top 5 heavyweight boxers list. Ajagba (13-0) is one of the highly revered heavyweight boxers in the world after 13 wins and 11 knockouts without a loss since the start of his professional career in 2017. The Nigerian became famous after contender, Curtis Harper, walked off the ring before the start of their fight in 2018. In the list, Fury named himself as the No. 1 heavyweight fighter in the world, while American knockout specialist, Deontay Wilder, took the second position. Fellow champion Joshua also featured as No. 3, while the final places were taken up by Dillian Whyte and Oleksandr Usyk – the WBC and WBO mandatory challengers respectively. Ajagba is currently ranked No. 13 in the current WBC heavyweight list. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
