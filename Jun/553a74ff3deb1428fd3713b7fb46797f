Dangote Industries Limited has clinched an award through its television commercial featured on the Cable Network News, detailing its business processes. A statement issued by the company on Sunday said the recognition came barely a week after emerging the most admired brand in Africa. It said the award, dubbed ‘Most Compelling Agency Story’ by the World Travel Market was won with the ‘Farm to Table’ commercial, which detailed the process of food metamorphosis from the farm as raw material to the final process as food on tables at home. The pan-African company said the commercial, which is part of the ‘Touching Lives’ documentary aired weekly on the CNN, was shot by the CNN International Commercial, and showcased how Dangote had been touching the lives of the people through its businesses.
