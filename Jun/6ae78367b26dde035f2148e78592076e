Samson Folarin Ibidunni, a popular Lagos businesswoman and wife of Lagos-based pastor and founder of Trinity House, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo, is dead. The PUNCH gathered that the event planner and marriage counsellor died in Port Harcourt. A member of the churchâ€™s media team, Matthew Osarenren, confirmed the sad news to The PUNCH on Sunday. He, however, said he could not speak further and cut the call. The deceased, who founded Ibidunni Ighodalo Foundation, supported couples having difficulty bearing children.
