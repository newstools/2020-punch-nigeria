Peter Dada, Akure Leadership crisis has hit the Ondo State chapter of the Social Democratic Party as the party has become factionalised. A faction of the party said it had suspended a former Minister for Defence, Dr Olu Agunloye, over alleged anti-party activities. This came after the State Executive Council of the party was dissolved by the party’s National Working Committee and subsequently appointed a caretaker committee to run party’s affairs. The dissolved State Working Committee led by Chief Korede Duyile, announced Agunloye’s suspension. Announcing the suspension, the party’s Publicity Secretary, Mr Remi Olayiwola, stated that Agunloye was suspended for gross anti-party activities and deficit tendency against the party since he lost the governorship election in 2016. He added that Agunloye’s suspension had been ratified by the party’s SWC in Akure. In his reaction, Agunloye, who is the party’s Deputy National Chairman, described the action of members of the dissolved SWC as a nullity and of no effect, saying the tenure of the dissolved SWC had expired. Agunloye stated that the NWC had set up a caretaker committee with Mr Oladele Ogunbameru and Prince Ebenezer Adeniyan as chairman and secretary respectively. He said, “There is a need to inject young and dynamic people and blood into the party for it to move forward. The NWC has filed necessary papers to the Independent National Electoral Commission in preparation for the forthcoming governorship elections in Ondo and Edo states.” Copyright PUNCH.
