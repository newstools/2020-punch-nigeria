Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti A 45-year-old carpenter, Olufalayi Obadare, has been killed by a mob, who suspected him to be an armed robber at the Olujoda area of Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital. It was gathered that some youths, who saw the carpenter roaming the neighbourhood at about 5pm on Tuesday, mistook him for one of the robbers troubling the area. The youths reportedly descended on him and attacked him with deadly weapons until he died. Obadare’s wife, Yemi, who said her husband, a father of three, left their home on Tuesday for the Olujoda area to meet a client, lamented that it was wrong for the youths to have mistaken him for a robber without verifying their suspicion. The bereaved wife, who tasked the police and other appropriate authorities not to leave any stone unturned in apprehending the culprits and ensuring justice in the matter, said, “My husband told me that he was going to Olujoda to get a job.

The question to ask is – did they see any dangerous weapon on him? Why couldn’t they take him to the person who contracted him for the job to know his true identity? “This is a gross injustice and the perpetrators must be brought to book.” Ekiti State Police Public Relations Officer, Sunday Abutu, who confirmed the incident on Thursday, said, “Investigations had begun into the matter.” Abutu, who said that the remains of the deceased had been deposited in the morgue, added that some suspects had been apprehended in connection with the incident.
