Ife Ogunfuwa The leadership of Computer Village, Ikeja Lagos says the N1,000 monthly levy demand from shop owners will cater to security needs in the market. The Iyaloja of the market, Mrs Abisola Azeez, while speaking at a press conference in Lagos, said funds would also be channeled towards maintaining cleanliness in the market. She denied reports claiming that the Iyaloja General of Lagos State, Mrs Folashade Ojo-Tinubu, was demanding N5m daily from the market executives. Azeez said, “We wish to explain the basis of the N1,000 requested from our market members. “When I was installed as Iyaloja and Mr Adeniyi Olasoji was also installed as Babaloja, we saw an opportunity to keep our environment clean and ensure security in line with Lagos State environmental laws. “We requested for N1,000 for security, market maintenance and we also intend to increase our security in the morning and night. “The allegation that the Iyaloja General of Lagos State, Mrs Ojo-Tinubu, is requesting for N5m daily is false and nothing of such existed.” Azeez also denied reports that there was a crisis in the market that led to the shutdown of the market. She pledged the commitment of the excos to an inclusive administration, saying they were ready to work harmoniously with the associations and different tribes in the market to make an all-inclusive administration.
