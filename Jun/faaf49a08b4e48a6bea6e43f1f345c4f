Samson Folarin The Lagos State Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Gbolahan Lawal, has reportedly resigned his position in the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration. Lawal’s purported resignation on Thursday was said to be connected to his ambition to be the next Oniru of Iruland in Lagos. The royal stool had been vacant after the former occupant, Oba Idowu Abiodun, died in September 2019. There had been contentions among the three ruling houses, whose candidates had been laying claims to the position. The tussle had been between a former Lagos commissioner, Adesegun Oniru, and a retired police officer, Hakeem Ajasa. Lawal, who had been in the background, was reported to have been the leading candidate.
