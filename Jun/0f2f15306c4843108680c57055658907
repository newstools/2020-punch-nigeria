Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has pulled out of the reconciliation of the Edo State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party. He accused some members of the National Working Committee of the PDP of being sycophants and tax collectors who would never tell the truth. According to a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, Wike spoke in Port Harcourt on Tuesday. The Rivers State Governor said the National Working Committee, instead of carrying everybody along in Edo State, resorted to using the media to blackmail him. Wike said, “I told them that in Edo State, we must handle the issue carefully and carry everybody along. They must respect human beings and not behave like tax collectors. “They said because an order was obtained from a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, then I am responsible. “I have had sleepless nights to resolve the issue in Edo State. The governors of Edo, Adamawa, and Delta states know what I have done to resolve the issues in Edo State. “As a result of this senseless accusation, I have pulled out of Edo State settlement. My integrity matters. “Nobody will rubbish me by raising false accusations against me. I will fight back.” Wike said he was no longer going to participate in any reconciliation. “I am brought up not to accept injustice, and that is why I keep speaking out on national issues. Nobody in the PDP can intimidate Rivers State.” Wike added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
