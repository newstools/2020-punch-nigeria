Johnny Edward Lille  star Victor Osimhen has reached a verbal agreement with Napoli over a summer move, according to a close source, The PUNCH reports. The Nigeria international has been courted by top European clubs following his impressive debut season, although Lille are desperate to keep hold of him. Several reports claim that Lille are asking for a €60m transfer fee for Oshimen with his agent demanding a five-year deal with an annual wage of €4m excluding bonuses. “There’s an agreement with Napoli but anything can still happen since it hasn’t been signed yet,” the source told The PUNCH exclusively. “The deal for him to join Napoli will fall through only if Lille receive an excessive offer from another club. “Several teams are reportedly ready to spend big to sign Victor (Osimhen) but they have yet to make a bid as we speak despite talks.” The 21-year-old has four years left on his Lille contract, and the club will be forced to cash in if he continues to attract mammoth offers from teams. Osimhen scored 18 goals and recorded six assists in 31 appearances before the Ligue 1 season was called off due to COVID-19. He was voted Lille’s Player of The Season following his exploits in his debut season in France. Copyright PUNCH.
