Olaleye Aluko The Nigerian military  through Operations Hadarin Daji, Accord and Katsina, has conducted air strikes on two bandits’ camps in Tsibiri and Manya communities in the Zurmi Local Government Area of Zamfara State, killing scores of the bandits. The Defence Headquarters, Abuja, said on Sunday that the air strikes were carried out on Saturday while the ground troops recovered 496 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition, seven dane guns, three mobile phones and other items from the bandits. The DMO Coordinator, Maj. Gen. John Enenche,in a statement, said, “Scores of bandits have been neutralised and their weapons destroyed in air strikes executed by the Air Component of Operation Hadarin Daji at two separate bandits’ camps at Tsibiri and Manya in the Zurmi LGA. “The air interdiction missions were executed on the heels of credible intelligence reports indicating that the camps with their clusters of thatched huts were being used by the bandits to house their fighters and store their weapons and ammunition. “Accordingly, two Nigerian Air Force attack helicopters were dispatched to engage the location, scoring accurate hits on the target area, leading to the destruction of the structures and the weapons as well as the neutralisation of bandits in the huts and surrounding bushes. “The attack helicopters later conducted an air strike on another camp South of Manya, which also resulted in the killing of more bandits, including some of their leaders, as they gathered for a meeting at the location.” Copyright PUNCH.
