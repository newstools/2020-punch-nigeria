Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia Four persons have been reportedly killed in a communal clash between two communities in Abia and Akwa Ibom states. A traditional ruler from one of the affected communities in the Ikwuano Local Government Area of Abia State, Eze Kanu Ujali, reported the incident to the Commissioner of Police in the state, Mrs Janet Agbede, during a familiarisation meeting between the CP and traditional rulers in the Ikwuano/Umuahia Federal Constituency on Thursday. The monarch said the clash was as a result of a boundary dispute, which had been recurring for some years, especially during the farming season. He urged the state police command to beef up security in the area to avert further loss of lives and prosperity in the area. Agbede said the command would ensure that peace returned to the affected communities. She urged the traditional rulers in the affected communities to report the matter to the offices of the deputy governors of their states in order to seek peaceful resolution of the crisis. She said investigations were going to uncover the facts of the incident and bring the perpetrators to justice. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
