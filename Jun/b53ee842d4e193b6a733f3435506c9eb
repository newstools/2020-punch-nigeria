John Alechenu, Abuja The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, Yekini Nabena, has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu (retd.), to convene a National Executive Committee meeting to prevent the party from collapsing. Nabena said this in an interview with newsmen in Abuja, on Saturday. He explained that the party was drifting towards disintegration unless urgent action was taken. The party chieftain said, “I call on our dear President to accede to the request by a majority of well-meaning party members and leaders and convene an emergency NEC meeting to address the leadership crisis and deliberate on consolidating the APC’s control of Edo and Ondo States ahead of the forthcoming governorship elections.” READ ALSO: How PDP govs, chieftains endorsed Obaseki, Shaibu ticket According to him, the President’s position as the leader of the ruling party puts him in good stead to call every member of the party to order. Nabena said the President should use his position to convene an emergency NEC meeting “because the crisis within the party should not be allowed to degenerate further”. He alleged that Victor Giadom, who is parading himself as the party’s acting National Chairman, was acting out a script of certain individuals who didn’t wish the APC well. Nabena further said, “At least four people are laying claim to the chairmanship of the APC following the court-ordered suspension of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. “All manner of Court cases and orders are flying around contesting party decisions and National Working Committee positions. Factions are festering at the national level and many states. The APC is clearly at a tipping point.”
