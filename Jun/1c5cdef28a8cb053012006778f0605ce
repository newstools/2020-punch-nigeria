Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Churches in Osun State on Sunday opened for congregational worship for the first time since March 31, when the state government announced a total lockdown of the state to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Our correspondent, who visited some churches within the Osogbo metropolis, observed that they kept to an hour service duration that religious leaders in the state had agreed with the government. They also adhered to social distancing in their sitting arrangements, while worshippers used nose masks. Although all the churches visited provided water and soap with sanitisers for worshippers to wash their hands before entering the halls, many of them, especially small churches did not use thermometers to check the temperature of worshippers before they were allowed in.
