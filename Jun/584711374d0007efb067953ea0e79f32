’Tosin Oluwalowo Villarreal manager, Javi Calleja, says Samuel Chukwueze is a complete player. Calleja said this in an interview with the club’s website on Friday. Chukwueze has been involved in both of Villarreal’s goals following the return of the Spanish LaLiga after the COVID-19 break. According to Calleja, the 22-year-old Eagles star has what it takes to become a top player if he continues to perform at his best. “We’ve worked a lot and Samu is a very complete player. If he continues on this path, he’ll become a really top footballer,”Calleja said. The Eagles winger has three goals and four assists in 28 league appearances for Villarreal this season.
