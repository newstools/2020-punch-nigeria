Tony Okafor,Awka The resident doctors at the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University Teaching Hospital, Awka, Anambra State, on Wednesday commenced indefinite strike. While stating that their action was in line with the directive of the National Association of Resident Doctors of Nigeria, they accused politicians in the state of looting the COVID-19 fund. Their statement was signed by the President and Secretary of COOUTH chapter  of the NARD, Obinna Aniagboso, and Chidiebele Egolum, respectively. Their statement read in part, “We strongly appeal to  the Anambra State governor to give our demands the urgent attention they deserve so that we can return to our duty posts soonest to continue providing essential care during this pandemic period. “We reiterate that payment of COVID-19 hazard and inducement allowance is sancrosanct and non-negotiable. “It is unconscionable for politicians to fritter away the COVID-19 fund donated by philanthropists while COOUTH doctors who have been on the frontlines exposing themselves to increasing risk with inadequate PPEs continue to earn an insulting hazard allowance of N3,500.” Copyright PUNCH.
