Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja The Institute of Diaspora and African Studies, University of Lagos, has condemned racism and police brutality in the United States, which has sparked a series of protests in many countries across the world. The Director of IADS, UNILAG, Prof. Muyiwa Falaye, said this in a statement on Friday while reacting to the killing of an unarmed African American, George Floyd, by the police in Minneapolis. The institute said the protests show that the people have lost confidence in the traditional bargaining structures of the US such as the courts, the police, and the political parties that have failed to change the racial situation of America over the years.

The statement read in part, “The Institute of Diaspora and African Studies, University of Lagos, condemns racism and injustice wherever they manifest in the world. In the United States specifically, there must be an end to police brutality against blacks and other ethnic minorities. “We believe the riots and revolts across the world occasioned by the killing of George Floyd have drawn sufficient attention to how the world feels about the attitude and actions of individuals who have elected to be inured to the racial practices of antebellum America.”
