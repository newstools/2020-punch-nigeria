JOHN ALECHENU THE National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, on Saturday presented the party’s certificate of return to the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki. He said the party was delighted to have the governor who he said has seen firsthand how the system and processes work within the PDP. Secondus also presented the INEC nomination form to the governor. In response, Obaseki said, “All that is left for one this afternoon is to tell you how I and my deputy are grateful to this great  party. “In our hours of tribulation when we were pushed out in the raging storm you gave us the umbrella. “By the grace of God, victory is going to be ours at the end of the day. “I want Mr Chairman for you to thank my co-aspirants for being gracious enough to take the painful decision to step down after committing so much.” Obaseki also announced that he was running with his deputy governor, Philip Shuaibu. He said, “You don’t change a winning team.” Two of his co-aspirants Keneth Imasuagbon and Gideon Ihile, also attended the event. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
