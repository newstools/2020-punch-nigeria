 The Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has urged the Independent Electoral Commission and the security agencies to be neutral in the September 19 governorship election in the state. The state Chairman of the PDP, Dr Tony Aziegbemi, said at a press briefing on Saturday that Edo people had shown their preference for the party based on multiple opinion polls conducted by independent bodies and organisations. He said, â€œFlowing from the above, we hereby demand, in the strongest terms possible, that the INEC and the security agencies carry out their statutory responsibilities based on the oath of office they swore to, which is to be neutral. However, anyone who deviates from this sacred oath, which he or she willingly swore to, knows that we will ensure that the most extreme hand of the law is meted out to them. Copyright PUNCH.
