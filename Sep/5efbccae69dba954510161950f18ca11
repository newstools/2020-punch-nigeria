Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Caretaker Committee Chairman of the governing All Progressives Congress, Mai Mala Buni, on Monday led the chairman of the party’s governorship election campaign for Edo State, Abdullahi Ganduje, to a meeting with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The meeting was held behind closed doors in the President’s office. Although the agenda of the meeting was not made public, it held a day after the Independent National Electoral Commission declared the state governor, Godwin Obaseki, the winner of the governorship election held on Saturday. Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party defeated Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the APC and other contestants to emerge winner of the contest. Ganduje, who is the governor of Kano State, was in the Benin, the Edo State capital, during the election but was said to have left on Sunday shortly before the final result of the election was announced. Unlike the previous meetings they had with Buhari ahead of the election, Buni and Ganduje were seen using a different route apparently to avoid any encounter with State House correspondents. As of the time of filing this report, the Presidency has yet to issue a statement on the meeting. While Buhari had on Sunday congratulated Obaseki on his electoral victory and commended INEC, the APC has yet to speak officially on the election. After a meeting he had with Buhari on August 7, Ganduje, had in an interview with State House correspondents, claimed that Obaseki’s abysmal performance would make the election a walk over for the APC. He boasted that incumbency factor would not work for Obaseki. Copyright PUNCH.
