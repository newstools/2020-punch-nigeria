Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja The founder of The Synagogue, Church of All Nations, Temitope Joshua, commonly referred to as TB Joshua, has warned Barcelona Football Club captain, Lionel Messi, against leaving the club. Joshua said this in a post on his official Instagram page on Wednesday. He wrote, “It is not good advice for Lionel Messi to leave Barcelona bitter and offended. It is impossible to establish a healthy relationship with a person who left a previous relationship bitter and offended. This is my candid advice to Messi. History is our boss.” Messi, a six-time Ballon D’Or winner, recently handed the club a transfer request following a humiliating 8-2 defeat the club suffered against the German side, Bayern Munich, during the last UEFA Champions League clash. The Barcelona icon is reported to be in talks with the English side, Manchester City, where former Barcelona Coach, Pep Guardiola, is the current manager. However, Barcelona have refused to let their number 10 man to go, insisting that Messi’s release clause of €700m must be paid.
