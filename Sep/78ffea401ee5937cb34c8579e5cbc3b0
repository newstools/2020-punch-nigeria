Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Security Outfit, also known as Amotekun, has arrested three persons suspected to be members of a kidnap gang terrorising the state. It was gathered that the suspects were arrested on Wednesday after allegedly abducting a man, Mr Kunle Agbayewa, in Ido Ani, Ose Local Government Area of the state. The incident happened barely 24 hours after the Medical Director of the General Hospital, Idoani, Dr Olufemi Adeogun, and two other health workers were abducted by the hoodlums. According to a source, the suspects stormed a sawmill and held Agbayewa at gunpoint before taking him away to an unknown destination. A resident of the community, Comfort Ilesanmi, who confirmed the abduction, said the suspects were allegedly herdsmen, who were seeing roaming about the streets of the town. She said, “The herdsmen entered the sawmill and kidnapped him immediately but people around quickly raised the alarm and invited the security men.” READ ALSO: Truck driver, owner in court for killing two in Lagos Reacting, the Commander of Amotekun Corps in the state, Mr Adetunji Adeleye, confirmed the incident and said the victim was rescued shortly after he was abducted by the suspects.
