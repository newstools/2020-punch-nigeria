Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja The spokesman for the Vice-President, Mr. Laolu Akande, says the recent hike in electricity tariff will not affect Nigerians because the hike is targeted at only those who experience stable electricity for 12 hours and above. Akande said this on Channels Television’s ‘Sunrise Daily’ programme on Wednesday. He was responding to a question on how the Federal Government’s ‘Economic Survival Fund’ would ameliorate the suffering of Nigerians in the face of electricity tariff hike and an increase in the pump price of petrol. The Presidential aide said, “Regarding the electricity tariff, the majority of Nigerians will not be paying more and I will like to say that again. Regarding the electricity tariff, the majority of Nigerians will not be paying more and that is essentially because if you are currently receiving anything below 12 hours of electricity a day, your tariff will not go up.

The Vice-President’s spokesman also said the increase in the pump price of petrol caused by the deregulation of the oil sector was done with good intentions. He said although Nigerians may face hardship in the short term, the move would have long term benefits including job creation.
