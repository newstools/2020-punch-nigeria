Kelvin Ekerete Undefeated Nigerian heavyweight boxing sensation, Efe Ajagba, is scheduled to make his Top Rank debut against Jonathan Rice in a 10-round clash on September 19, at the Bubble, MGM Grand, in Las Vegas. The bout is an undercard fight to a 10-round junior welterweight headliner between former two-division titlist Jose Pedraza and Javier Molina. The fight is Ajagba’s second of the year after his ninth-round knockout of Razvan Cojanu at the Barclays Center, New York in March. Ajagba joined Bob Arum’s Top Rank in August having previously fought under Richard Schaefer’s Ringstar Sports Promotion since becoming a professional in 2017. The 26-year-old is unbeaten in 13 fights, winning 11 of his bouts via knockouts, while Rice has lost five times and drawn once in 19 professional career bouts. American Rice lost two of his last five fights. Top Rank’s Vice President of Operations, Carl Moretti, told fight lovers to expect an explosive bout. “Anytime you have the opportunity to showcase an undefeated power-punching heavyweight who will be a player in the division shortly, it’s a win-win,” Moretti told BoxingScene.com.
