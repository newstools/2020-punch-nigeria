Daud Olatunji,Abeokuta Workers in Ogun State have called off their one-week warning strike after a lengthy meeting with the officials of state government. The state Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress, Emmanuel Bankole, announced this on Friday after a closed-door meeting held at the Governor’s office, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. Bankole said the union leaders had secured the commitment of the government on their demands. The organised labour had on Wednesday commenced a week warning strike over the minimum wage, unpaid contributory pension, totalling 134 months deducted from workers and unremitted; non-promotion of staff since 2018 and unpaid leave allowances to all employees, both of the state and of local governments since 2015. While calling off the strike, Bankole, who was flanked by leaders of other unions, said, “I want to inform our members across the state that we have been able to get  the commitment of the government as to the welfare matters, hence, the strike is hereby called off.” He said the NLC had secured the government’s commitment to its demands, including the commitment to begin implementing the new minimum wage next month. Speaking further on the memorandum of understanding, the NLC state chairman said the state government agreed to earmark N500m for the clearance of gratuity on quarterly basis while payment would commence in January, 2021.
