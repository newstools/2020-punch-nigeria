A church, Ministers of God Prayer Network International, has called on God to intervene in the challenges facing the country. MGPNI made the call at a mini crusade it jointly organised with the Christian Association of Nigeria, Lagos State chapter, at Apa Kingdom in Badagry, Lagos to consecrate the town and a sacred bronze staff inherited from early missionaries. A statement quoted the National President of MGPNI, Bishop Bola Oyegbami, as saying, “The consecration occasion, a one-day mini crusade by MGPNI in conjunction with CAN was tagged, ‘God releasing Badagry,Apa Kingdom/Lagos State unto Greatness.” The Alapa of Apa Kingdom, Oba Oyekan Illufemiloye, Possi lll, at the event, presented to the church for blessing the bronze staff given to his forebears by early missionaries. Oyegbami said the site of the staff would be turned into a tourist centre, “a centre where an edifice would be built. The bronze staff would be conspicuously displayed at the centre of the edifice for the people to view it.” Copyright PUNCH.
