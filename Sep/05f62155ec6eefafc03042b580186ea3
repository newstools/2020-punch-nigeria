Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi Senator Isa Hamma Misau, who is an ally of a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Yakubu Dogara, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party and rejoined the All Progressives Congress. Misau, who represented Bauchi Central Senatorial District in the 8th Assembly, announced his defection to the APC during a meeting with the APC Caretaker Chairman/Yobe State Governor, Mai-Mala Buni, at the Yobe Governor’s Lodge in Abuja on Friday. But in a swift reaction, the Bauchi State PDP said it was not perturbed by the senator’s defection. The state chairman of the PDP, Hamza Akuyam, described Misau’s defection as “good radiance to bad rubbish.” Misau rejoined the APC after about two months that his political ally, Dogara, also rejoined the party from the PDP.
