Tony Okafor, Awka The Indigenous People of Biafra has said the South-East governors and the Ohanaeze Ndigbo will live to regret their alleged role in its proscription by the Federal Government. It described the proscription as the greatest mistake the Ohaneze Ndigbo and the South-East governors had made in history. IPOB alleged that the Igbo leaders by the act opened the area to constant attacks and humiliation by alleged terrorists, herdsmen, and bandits.

By conniving with the enemies to get rid of IPOB that is the only defence line of Biafra nation, they have opened our land to constant attack and humiliation.”
