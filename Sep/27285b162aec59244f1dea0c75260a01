Wife of Ondo State Governor, Mrs Betty Akeredolu, has commenced online registration of market women to ensure that they benefit from the dividends of governance in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Akeredolu began the registration exercise on Saturday at Agagu market in Akure South and Ogbese in Akure North council areas of the state. She said market women were crucial to the socioeconomic development of the society, adding that her visit to the markets was on how the present administration could make life more meaningful to the women. He said, “I understand the fact that there is a gap for government to reach out directly to the market women and this is the major reason of our visit to close the gap on why our market women are not getting what they are supposed to get from the government. “This present administration under the leadership of Gov. Akeredolu has rolled out millions of naira as soft loan to market women, but probably people cornered it.” She said the Office of the Wife of the Governor had trained people to register all the market women that would capture their details and totally avoid middlemen when reaching out to them. Mrs Akeredolu noted that the recently launched Ondo Widow Cares Initiative was successful with the help of digital technology where all widows in the state got registered and got government benefits without bias of party affiliation. The governor’s wife urged market women to register and again and vote for continuity of Gov. Akeredolu to consolidate on his good programmes for the state and promised that government would not neglect them after the election. The Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Women Affairs, Mrs Toyin Akimoyo, appealed to the market women to support Gov. Akeredolu’s re-election having seen all the laudable projects executed in his first term in office.
