Peter Dada, Akure The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Ondo State governorship election scheduled for October 10, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, has assured residents of border communities in the Akoko area of the state of adequate security if elected governor. Jegede also promised to tackle insecurity, especially the menace of kidnapping, which has become endemic in the area. He said this during a campaign visit to Ikakumo in the Akoko North-East Local Government Area. Jegede said, “We are highly concerned for your welfare and are worried over the onslaught of kidnappers and other criminals in Akoko border communities. “I want to assure you of an effective security arrangement that will stamp out the incidence of kidnapping, disruptive invasions and other criminal activities in these areas.” Earlier, a PDP leader in the local government, Mr Tunde Obaide, had said, “Ikakumo is a gateway town; we have anointed all the border points in unison and God will help us to ward off whoever intends to subvert the people’s will come October 10.” Copyright PUNCH.
