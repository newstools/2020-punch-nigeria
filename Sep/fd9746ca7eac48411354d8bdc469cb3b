Friday Olokor, Abuja The Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen has on behalf of Nigerian women demanded that the 35 per cent affirmative action in favour of the female gender be taken into consideration in the current effort by the National Assembly to review the 1999 constitution. Specifically, the minister said the constitution should have a provision which will make it mandatory for all political parties to ensure that “35 per cent quota should be used for candidate’s selection.” Tellen said this in a key not address presented on her behalf by her Special Assistant, Jummai Adonijie, during the opening ceremony of national review conference with the theme. ‘25 years since Beijing: Accelerating commitments in Nigeria,’ organised by the Nigerian Women Trust Fund, with support from Ford Foundation, in Abuja, on Tuesday. Tallen said, “The recent call by the Senate Ad-hoc Committee on the review of the 1999 constitution, which again commenced the process of further alteration to the provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) is perhaps the climax of such efforts by Nigerian women to add their voice to the entire process. “In response to the recent call, Nigerian Women, young and old, women with disabilities and representatives of professional women groups and the National Council of Women Societies have under the aegis of my ministry, made their submission, hoping that all the issues raised will be addressed. “We demand Affirmative Action measures to be incorporated into the new constitution. There is a need for the reform of the constitution that will make it clear that each (political) party must adopt the quota system and the issue of reserving seats for women.” Copyright PUNCH.
