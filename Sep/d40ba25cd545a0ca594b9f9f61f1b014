Dayo Ojerinde The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS has warned against the dangers of failing to respect human rights in the response of COVID-19. UNAIDS, in a report, titled, ‘Rights in a pandemic – Lockdowns, rights and lessons from HIV in the early response to COVID-19’, reveals interruptions of HIV services, violence, harassment, abuse, arrests, deaths and a failure to respect human rights in their early responses to the pandemic. The report, which is available on UNAIDS website was released on August 27. “During the early response to COVID-19, UNAIDS received numerous reports of interruptions to HIV services and disturbing human violations against vulnerable and marginalised populations. “The experience of the response to HIV has proved that violations of human rights during a pandemic undermine trust, harm individuals, and set back public health responses,” the report stated. The Executive Director of UNAIDS, Winnie Byanyima, said, “This report is designed to help governments take positive steps to respond to human rights concerns in the evolving context of COVID-19. “It is a myth that there can be a trade-off between human rights and public health,” said Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of UNAIDS.  Human rights are not only intrinsic, but they are also the very means by which governments can successfully beat a pandemic.” Copyright PUNCH.
