Ifeoluwa Oyerinde The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested a businesswoman, Hajiya Hadiza Umar, for allegedly defrauding a job seeker. The EFCC Head of Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale, in a statement, said the suspect defrauded the victim, Nuraddeen Abubakar, of N3m, by promising to secure employment for him at the anti-graft agency. He noted that EFCC officials arrested the suspect’s son at a branch of Guaranty Trust Bank, where he was making a transaction on the suspect’s account. He was reportedly lured to the bank and detained, as the mother showed up and was subsequently arrested. Oyewale explained that the victim met the suspect through her son and was asked to pay N6m, but he only paid N3m into the suspect’s account on October 29, 2019. According to the EFCC spokesman, Abubakar alleged that Umar promised that an employment letter would be delivered two weeks after making the payment, and the other half of the money should be paid after he had received an employment letter. “The victim stated that he had not received an employment letter nine months after paying the suspect,” he added. Oyewale stated that the suspect would soon be charged to court. Copyright PUNCH.
