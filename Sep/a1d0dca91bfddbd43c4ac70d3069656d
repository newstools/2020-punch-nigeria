Adeyinka Adedipe,  Benin The 17 factional lawmakers of Edo State House of Assembly, led by Victor Edoror, held plenary on Wednesday and warned commercial bank’s not to grant loans to Governor Godwin Obaseki. They also said the approval given to the governor to secure loans by the other faction, led by Frank Okiye, was wrong. Speaking under matters of urgent public importance, the factional Deputy Speaker, Emmanuel Agbaje, decried the approval of the loan “by an illegal gathering of dissident members in the Government House, who claim they have approved N1.5bn naira for Godwin Obaseki-led government of Edo State. He said the purpose of the loan was to fund election, adding, “Their election is not an official matter of the state, we as a House cannot afford to sell the future of our children.” Another lawmaker, Chrias Okaeben, said he was embarrassed by the action of the governor. But, Okiye, who described the 17 lawmaker as impostors, said responding to their action amounted to giving them credibility. He also said they should be taken to court and tried for treason and felony. “If the police are serious, they should have arrested them and let them meant to face the full wrath of the law,” Okiye added.
