Oladimeji Ramon The Ajia Balogun Olubadan, Chief Adegboyega Adegoke, says he has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party for the All Progressives Congress. Adegoke, in a statement on Sunday, said he took the decision after wide consultations with his political associates, leaders and supporters across the 33 local government areas of Oyo state. He declared as fake news, media reports that he remained in the PDP and urged his supporters to dismiss such. “Few days ago, there was a fake news story that I, Olooye Adegboyega Taofeek Adegoke, has decided to stay back in the PDP. “Nothing could be farther from the truth. I am in APC 100 per cent and will remain in the APC. Please disregard any rumours or fake news. Just be calm, there is no cause for alarm as victory is certain by His grace,” Adegoke, a senatorial hopeful, said in the statement. Copyright PUNCH.
