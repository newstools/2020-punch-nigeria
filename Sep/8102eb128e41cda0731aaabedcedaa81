Maiharaji Altine, Gusau Thousands of the All Progressives Congress supporters in Zamfara State on Sunday converged the state police command’s headquarters in Gusau to demonstrate over the arrest of 17 of their members. The police had on Saturday arrested the APC members at the residence of one of the party’s stalwart, Alhaji Abubakar Dantabawa. The party’s supporters, who were angry with the arrest of their political associates, demanded that they should be released and threatened to take drastic action against the police. The police threw tear gas canisters at the protesting APC supporters to disperse them but they refused to leave. When all efforts to send away the protesters failed, the police discharged all the arrested APC supporters which brought to an end the violent protect. The spokesperson for the command, SP Mohammed Shehu said, “The police got an intelligent report that the arrested APC supporters were in a meeting with repentant bandits in the house of one Alhaji Abubakar Dantabawa, trying to convince them to go back to banditry.” The APC chairman Alhaji Lawal Liman, described the police intelligent report as baseless as well as an attempt to smear the good image of the party in the state. “The police commissioner has on several occasions used his office to fight the APC supporters because he is being used by the Zamfara State Government,” said Liman.
