Joseph Olaoluwa Maersk Line says it has directed its commercial department to stop applying the peak season surcharge from Tuesday (today). The shipping line made this known in a letter addressed to the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Shippers’ Council, Hassan Bello, and signed by the Managing Director of Maersk Nigeria, Lara Lana. This is coming after the Nigerian Shippers’ Council protested against the surcharge and recently convened a meeting of the Organised Private Sector to deliberate on the astronomical peak season surcharge imposed by shipping lines calling in Nigeria. According to a statement signed by the Head of Public Relations of the Nigerian Shippers Council, Rakiya Zubairu, the Union of African Shippers’ Council has acceded to the shippers’ council’s call for immediate suspension of the peak season surcharge, noting that it was a violation of previous European Community Shipowners Association agreements. It also said that an increase in shipping charges would require a notification from the Port Management Association of West and Central Africa and UASC before it could be allowed. Copyright PUNCH.
