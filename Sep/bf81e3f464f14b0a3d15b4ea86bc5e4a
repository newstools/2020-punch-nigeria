Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Police Command on Monday said the fire incident which destroyed over 5,000 card readers at the Ondo State headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission was caused by power surge. The inferno, which occurred at the computer section of the INEC office last Thursday, destroyed the card readers stored for the October 10 governorship election. Speaking with journalists at the state police command headquarters in Akure, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Bolaji Salami, said police investigations ruled out sabotage. He said, “Investigation into the incident is out. The fire was caused by faulty electrical connection and all the smart card readers were burnt. The smart cards were kept in two containers on the premises of INEC and the air conditioners were kept on for 24 hours. “This will put to rest speculations that the fire was caused by saboteurs. If there are other findings, we will let you know. For now, the major cause is faulty electrical connections. “This report is final from the fire service. They have the authority to investigate fire incidents in Akure.” On preparations by the command for the forthcoming Ondo State governorship election, the police boss said, “We are working hard to curtail political violence. We are meeting with political leaders to tell their followers to desist from attacking each other. We are investigating all aspects around the killing in Idanre.” Copyright PUNCH.
