Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan A former governorship candidate of the African Democratic Party in Oyo State, Senator Olufemi Lanlehin, has dumped the party and returned to the All Progressives Congress. Lanlehinâ€™s return to the APC came after the alliance with the Peoples Democratic Party collapsed. The ADC and some political parties had formed an alliance with the PDP candidate, Seyi Makinde, against the governorship candidate of the APC in 2019 poll, but the alliance seemed to have crumbled. Lanlehin, who is a former lawmaker that represented Oyo South Senatorial District at the Senate, said leaders of the APC were holding talks with him and other aggrieved members. He was said to have held another meeting with his supporters at his residence in Ibadan on Monday. The former governorship candidate said he would always prioritise the interest of the people in anything he would do. Copyright PUNCH.
