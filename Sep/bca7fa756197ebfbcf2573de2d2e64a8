John Alechenu, Abuja The Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts, Busayo Wole Oke, on Tuesday said the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, was the best person to lead the Peoples Democratic Party in the South West. Oke said Makinde’s position as the only PDP governor in the zone conferred on him the leadership position in line with the norms and traditions of the PDP. The federal lawmaker said this in a statement titled “Makinde best person to lead PDP In South West- Reps member, Wole Oke,” made available to newsmen, in Abuja. Oke who represents Obokun/ Oriade Federal Constituency of Osun State, said “By convention and practices (of the PDP), Makinde, who is the only PDP governor in the South West, emerges as leader of the zone and no loyal and committed member of the PDP family should challenge the noble arrangement in the overall interest of the Party except for selfish interest.” The lawmaker said “Aside convention and practices he brings on board decency, finesse, humility, decorum, he cares and loves his fellow party men, he is educated, deep and exposed. He has a lot of experience and core professionals before coming into power. We can gain a lot from him.” He cautioned party members against interfering with the party’s established traditions.
