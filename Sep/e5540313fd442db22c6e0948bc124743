Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Independent National Electoral Commission says it has created a digital result collation portal for the Imo North Senatorial District election scheduled to hold on October 31. The INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner for the state, Prof. Francis Ezeonu, said this in an interview with journalists in Owerri, on Monday. While saying the commission was ready for the election, Ezeonu said INEC had improved on its 2019 outing and would do better during the bye-election. According to him, the essence of introducing the portal, which will provide first-hand information about the collation process, was to improve transparency. Ezeonu explained that Nigerian politicians were desperate for public office because they viewed politics as a “lucrative” venture. He, however, said appropriate sanctions would be meted out to INEC officials and ad hoc staff who engage in acts capable of undermining the electoral process. The REC announced that the commission would start relating with candidates for the bye-election after shortlisting their names on September 17.
