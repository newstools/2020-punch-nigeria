The Head of Itakete Remo community in the Remo North Local Government Area of Ogun State, Baale Awonuga Adelaja, has pleaded with the governor of the state, Prince Dapo Abiodun, to extend his developmental programmes to the community. Adelaja in a statement on Saturday appealed to the governor to help provide the town with basic social infrastructure such as good roads, electricity, schools and hospitals among other things to make their living comfortable. The community head made this appeal while speaking with journalists at the Isara Remo on the efforts being made to attract development to the community. He noted that the community was ready to “partner with the governor especially in its efforts to make Ogun State the food basket of the nation through several of its agricultural revolution programmes such as the Central Bank of Nigeria backed Anchor Borrowers programme.” He noted further that due to its nearness to Lagos/Ibadan Expressway, Itakete community is a good location for those who wanted to cite industries and create employment for the residents of the area saying, that the community was more than ready to strike partnership with willing investors.
