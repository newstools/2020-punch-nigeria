A flatbed truck carrying a 40-foot container lost control after it developed brake failure at the Iyana-Ipaja area of Lagos State. The incident happened on Monday night at about 10pm, according to an official of the Lagos Neighborhood Safety Corps who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak with the Press. The LNSC official, who was among the numerous state officials at the scene of the incident, said the truck was descending the Iyana-Ipaja bridge while facing the road towards Agbotikuyo Agege end. The driver lost control and crashed into a row of shops by the side of the road, just by the foot ofÂ  the Iyana-Ipaja overhead bridge near the roundabout in front of the motor park. No life was lost, the LNSC official said. See the photos:
