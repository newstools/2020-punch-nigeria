Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressive Congress have disagreed over the role of a former governor of Edo State, Adam Oshiomhole, in the violence in the state. While the PDP state Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, said the party had credible information that most of the attacks had been traced to the former governor’s residence, the media aide to Oshiomhole, Victor Oshoke, described the accusation as outrageous. Nehikhare said, “The police are not doing enough to arrest these criminals and the head of the gang, who we don’t know, but we have credible information that the residence of Adams Oshiomhole, both in Benin and Iyamho, are where most of the attacks have been traced to. “I think it is time for the police to execute an arrest warrant, not just for arms and ammunition, but for thugs who are resident there and using the place as cover to attack members of the PDP and the general public in Edo North and its environs.” But Oshoke said, “The accusation is preposterous. It is unbelievable that desperation could lead the Peoples Democratic Party to attempt to tarnish the image of Oshiomhole. “Oshiomhole is busy campaigning and selling the SIMPLE agenda of the party to the people and will not be distracted. He is not interested in joining issues with the PDP. “He has no hand in the violence and will never. Nobody comes to his house at Iyamho with weapons. It is only security details, who come in with weapons, and everybody who comes in is seriously searched at the gate before entry.” Copyright PUNCH.
