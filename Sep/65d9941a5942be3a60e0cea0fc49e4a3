Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has revealed that 31,000 police personnel will be on the ground to protect election officials, materials and voters as well as enforce the rules during Saturday’s governorship election in Edo State. “This massive deployment is not only to deter misguided political actors, but to show that they will be brought to justice, while those who go out peacefully to exercise their rights will be protected,” Adamu said this at a stakeholders’ meeting in Benin on Monday. The IG enjoined parents and guardians to keep their children and wards away from being used by politicians as thugs. He also promised that the police would be professional and non-partisan in handling the election. He also said the police would not hesitate to clamp down on election riggers and thugs who may want to disrupt the process. Responding to a question on what the police were doing to curb vote buying, Adamu said, “It is the politicians who buy votes. They are the ones who want to do everything to win the election. So, if they can avoid doing this on election (day), the security agencies will be able to perform their jobs easily. “We are not resting on our oars ensuring security is top-notch in the state before, during and after the election. I want to assure the stakeholders that the personnel of the Nigeria Police shall remain impartial, firm and professional. It is also the first time that the electoral inter-agency security committee is being put in place. “Plans have also been perfected by all the security outfits involved in the election to deal decisively with disruptive elements and proactively frustrate any attempts to undermine the election.” Copyright PUNCH.
