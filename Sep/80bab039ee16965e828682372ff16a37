Oyebade, gave this warning while addressing journalists alongside sister security agencies, in Benin, on Wednesday. The DIG said “Police officers comprising conventional, plain-clothed policemen and specia forces have been deployed to provide security, during and after the election. “We have carried out security threat analysis hence, all identified vulnerable points, entry and exit points have been mapped out for special security coverage, while the military is expected to perform the required complementary role.” He appealed to politicians and their supporters to refrain from making inflammatory comments which could lead to a breach of peace. Oyebade implored the media and National Orientation Agency to help sensitize the electorate. While pledging that officers and men of the police will conduct themselves in a professional manner, he said “For effective manning of polling booths, no fewer than three police officers and personnel of other security agencies will be deployed in each of the 2,627 polling booths.” Oyegbade said the police had resolved to protect the democratic process by providing enabling, and level playing ground for all actors.
