Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai has said the state is one of a few across the country to empower local government councils. El-Rufai said this at the 25th Annual Conference of Auditors-General of Local Governments in Kaduna State, on Tuesday. The governor equally announced that the state internally generated revenue rose from N13bn in 2015, to N44bn in 2019, without an increase in the tax burden on residents. El-Rufai said “In the bid to devolve our accountability and transparency, we promised and ensured that Local Government areas had full control of their funds. “Afterwards, we conducted local government elections using electronic voting to take democracy to the grassroots. So, when you look at the fact that we empowered Local Government Councils to have full control of their funds and conducted elections, we can rightly say we have democratized accountability and transparency” “For not only are the elected local government officials accountable to the laws and institutions of the land, but they are also accountable to the people, whose mandate they exercise in the first place. We believe that those elected to run affairs at the local level must be empowered to do so. “We are the first state to sign up to the Open Government Partnership and we have real-time monitoring of our projects all around the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
