Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, has charged mining companies and other operators in the minerals and metals sector to operate within the operational guidelines in the Mining Act. He made the call in Abuja when playing host to the Governor of Taraba State, Darius Ishaku, according to a statement issued on Tuesday by Theodore Agbagwa on behalf of the public relations director of the Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development. Adegbite told his guest that state governments would be carried along as the Federal Government worked towards sanitising the sector to make it viable for investment. The statement stated that Ishaku visited the mines and steel ministry to seek clarification on developments in the sector and to know exactly what Taraba State was doing right or wrong in mineral exploration. Adegbite said Taraba State was richly endowed with mineral resources, especially gemstones, describing it as a veritable source for revenue generation. The minister, however, stated that mining of the minerals by mining companies must follow laid down procedures including obtaining operational mining licences as well as payment of royalties to the Federal Government. On his part, Ishaku said the purpose of his visit was also for Taraba State to be carried along by the Federal Government in its plan on minerals exploration and mining. Copyright PUNCH.
