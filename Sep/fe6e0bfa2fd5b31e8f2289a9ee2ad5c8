Peter Dada, Akure THE Ondo State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has said it will defeat the ruling All Progressives Congress in the October 10 governorship election in the state. The party also said the results of the election would surprise the National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who had described the PDP as “dead” in the state. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘Bola Tinubu is a day dreamer’, signed by the state PDP Publicity Secretary, Mr Kennedy Peretei, in Akure, on Sunday. The party issued the statement in response to an earlier statement credited to Tinubu. Tinubu had while inaugurating the Ondo State Internal Revenue Service Complex, in Akure on Saturday, declared that the PDP was dead and would be buried in Ondo during the October 10 governorship election. In its statement, the PDP said, “Only last year, the PDP defeated the Buhari-led APC roundly at the presidential elections. The PDP also won two out of the three senatorial seats in Ondo State. How can such a party by any stretch of imagination be said to be dead? “It is shameful that the only project Tinubu came to inaugurate in three and half years is the Revenue House, a building that stands as a sign post of multiple taxation of the Ondo State people. “The PDP is offering affordable education and health care delivery as against Aketi engineered astronomical tuition fees that have thrown many of the students in tertiary institutions out of school. By October 10, Tinubu will know which party is dead in Ondo State.” Responding to the PDP statement, the state Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mr Alex Kalejaiye, defended Tinubu’s position.
