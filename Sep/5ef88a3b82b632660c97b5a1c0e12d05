James Abraham, Jos HUNDREDS of supporters of a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr Obadiah Mailafia, on Monday stormed the Jos office of the Department of State Services to witness his grilling. The supporters, who chanted solidarity songs, were, however, prevented from gaining entrance into the DSS compound. Mailafia said he hope that would be the last time he would be invited by the agency. The PUNCH had reported that Mailafia was invited by the DSS to appear at its office in Jos on Monday. Monday’s invitation to Mailafia by the DSS was the third in the last one month following an interview he granted a radio station in which he accused an unnamed northern governor of being the leader of Boko Haram. Mailafia arrived at the DSS office around 11 am in company with his wife, Margaret, and his lawyer, Yakubu Bawa, among others, including several clergy men. He was not released until around 2.55pm. Addressing his supporters after his release, Mailafia condemned his latest invitation by the DSS saying it was uncalled for. He insisted that the killings in Southern Kaduna and other parts of the country must stop. Mailafia said, “Thank you all for being here. Many have said worst things and nobody invited them. I hope this will be the last time I will be invited to the DSS office. All I am saying is that the killings must stop.” His lawyer and the Jos branch Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association, Mr Yakubu Bawa, who also condemned the action of the DSS, however, said his client was not manhandled during his three hours of interrogation.
