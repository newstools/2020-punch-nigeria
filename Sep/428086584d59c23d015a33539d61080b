Chima Azubuike, Gombe The Gombe State Police Command, on Thursday, paraded a 37-year-old farmer, identified as Ephraim Kadiri, over the killing of an Okada in Gombe. Parading the suspect at the state command headquarters, the Commissioner of Police, Shehu Maikudi, said the suspect took the motorcycle to where it was sold for N120,000. Maikudi said the Okada rider was hacked down and the motorcycle stolen, adding that it took the police much effort to rescue the suspect from an angry mob from attacking the divisional police station over the incident. The CP stated, “He (Kadiri) was the one, who almost caused mayhem for us yesterday (Wednesday) in Billiri after killing a commercial motorcyclist and stealing his motorcycle. Restive youths in Billiri thought we were not doing enough and attempted to attack the police station. We had to deploy our men there; the Area Commander had to speak to the youth as well as engage the stakeholders in the town to calm the situation. “Policemen were later deployed to Cham, where the suspect was arrested in a hotel, but he had sold the motorcycle at Laraban Lamurde.” Also paraded was a 21-year-old SS3 pupil, Babayo Yahaya, who was allegedly caught with 107 tramadol capsules and 59 sachets of Exole and N400,000 used to bribe the police. “Babayo Yahaya was arrested based on credible intelligence. Upon interrogation, the suspect confessed to be a dealer in illicit substances for over two years in Gombe and environs,” he added.    ,, Copyright PUNCH.
