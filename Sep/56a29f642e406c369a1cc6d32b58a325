Maiharaji Altine Gusau The family of Zamfara State Sharia Court Judge, Salihu Abdullahi, kidnapped by bandits three weeks ago, has launched an appeal fund, seeking for money to ransom him. Abdullahi was kidnapped by bandits along with his colleague, Shafi,u Jangebe, when they were returning to Zamfara State from Niger Republic where they were studying in one of the universities in that country. The bandits demanded the sum of N10m for the release of each of the kidnapped judges. Speaking to The PUNCH, a family member, Malam Hassan Samaru said they had launched an appeal fund in order to raise the money to pay the ransom. Hassan maintained that they have already sold some properties of the kidnapped judge, including his plot of land but the money was still not complete. “It becomes compulsory for us to seek for financial assistance from relations and well-wishers in order to save our brother from his abductees,” Said Hassan. He stressed that, some philantrophists have started sending their assistance to the family, though he didn’t mention the amount already realized and the balance still needed. Copyright PUNCH.
