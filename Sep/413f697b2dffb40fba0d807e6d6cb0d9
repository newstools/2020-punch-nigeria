Kelvin Ekerete The League Management Company has released a list of conditions for clubs in the Nigeria Professional Football League ahead of the 2020/21 season. On the list, the LMC set a minimum N200m for every club in the country’s topflight league, as well as a comprehensive insurance for its players and officials before the commencement of the league in October. All the club’s must also adhere to all COVID-19 safety protocols before they are licensed, the LMC added. On Monday, the league body invited the 20 NPFL clubs to submit their licensing application. The invitation is sequel to an earlier notification to clubs in a letter dated August 6, 2020. The LMC’s list for club licensing documents and forms for the 2020/21 season made available to our correspondent directed clubs to show proof of a N200m, a major condition that must be met before they would be allowed into the league. The list stated that the clubs should provide “financial guarantee, commitment and confirmation of availability of a minimum of N200m from the owner of the club for the payment of salaries and other club operations expenses.” The clubs were also mandated to produce a“comprehensive insurance for players, officials, facilities insurance and spectators insurance, and the evidence of compliance with NCDC COVID-19 guidelines for employers and businesses in Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
