Tunde Ajaja The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria says it is investigating an allegation that the head of one of its departments asked staff members to contribute money for the repair of a damaged truck belonging to the department. Sunday PUNCH had in a story, titled, ‘Anger as aviation agency asks workers to donate towards truck repairs,’ published on September 20, reported that staff members of the Aerodome Rescue and Fire Fighting Services at the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos, alleged that they were asked by their head of the department to make the donation. They said even though the donation was voluntary, they were unhappy that such demand was made of them. A fireman was said to have rammed the truck into the Fire Bay at the domestic airport, during which its front passenger door, windscreen and bumper were partly damaged. The repair was estimated to cost N470,000. But in her response on Monday, the spokesperson for FAAN, Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, said the matter was being investigated. She stated, “We like to state first of all that FAAN is a responsible organisation and would on no account shy away from any of its responsibilities or solicit funds from its members of staff to carry out such. “In addition, the authority has in place a very robust and functional maintenance system for its facilities and infrastructure as well as insurance cover for all our fire trucks. However, the matter is already being investigated for necessary action.” Copyright PUNCH.
