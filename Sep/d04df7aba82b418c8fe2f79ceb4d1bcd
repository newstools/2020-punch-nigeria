Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State, Chris Nehikhare, has said the refusal of a former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, to endorse the party’s candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize Iyamu, is a plus for Governor Godwin Obaseki. Obaseki is the standard bearer of the PDP for the Edo State Governorship Election scheduled to hold on Saturday. He told our correspondent in an interview in Benin, on Tuesday, that the action of the elder statesman spoke volumes. Nehikhare said “A man of Odigie-Oyegun’s status not endorsing his party’s candidate tells you a lot about the candidate APC has. Edo people are happy with Governor Obaseki his achievements, his style and his sense of purpose.” Earlier while speaking to reporters, the PDP spokesman said, “The efforts so far put in place by the Buhari-led government to ensure the security and safety of Edo people, before, during and after the election, deserve commendation. “With the massive deployment of men of the Nigeria Police Force, the Military, Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps and other security agencies to Edo State to supervise Saturday’s election, we are confident that the election will be crisis-free.” Copyright PUNCH.
