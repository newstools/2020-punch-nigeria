James Abraham, Jos Hundreds of supporters of a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr Obadiah Mailafia, on Monday stormed the West of Mines office of the Department of State Services to witness the grilling of the ex-CBN top official. The supporters, who chanted solidarity songs were, however, prevented from gaining entrance into the DSS compound. The PUNCH had reported that Mailafia was invited by the DSS to appear at its office in Jos on Monday.

Mailafia arrived at the DSS office around 11 am together with his wife, Margaret, and his lawyer, Yakubu Bawa, among others including several clergymen. He was not released until around 2.55 pm. Addressing his supporters after his release, Mailafia condemned his latest invitation by the DSS, saying that such an invitation was uncalled for. He insisted that the killings in Southern Kaduna and other parts of the country must stop. Mailafia said, “Thank you all for being here. Many have said the worst things and nobody invited them. I hope this will be the last time I will be invited to the DSS office. All that I am saying is that the killings must stop.”
