Friday Olokor, Abuja the North East leaders, under the aegis of Coalition of North East Elders for Peace and Development, have demanded decisive actions to end Boko Haram terrorism. While expressing concern over the security situation across the country, the coalition said “the excuses being tendered by the Service Chiefs”, were no longer tenable. The Chairman of CNEEPD, Zana Goni, in a statement titled, ‘We are tired of excuses, sack Service Chiefs now,’ called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to rejig the country’s security architecture with a view to improving the security of Nigeria. The statement reads partly, “The worsening security situation in the country is further reinforcing the urgent need to inject new hands with fresh ideas to han­dle the nation’s security archi­tecture. We have seen that the security situation under the current service chiefs has reached an unbearable state. “There is no denying the fact that at this moment, the entire nation is distressed by the incessant mind­less killing of our citizens and pillaging of defenseless com­munities by insurgents, ban­dits and kidnappers. There is no denying the fact also that these have resulted to indescribable agony, anguish and torment to the Nigerian citizens. “And following these mentioned above, we, the Coalition of North East Elders for Peace and Development, in the strongest terms, restate the call to Pres­ident Muhammadu Buhari to honor the resolution of the National Assembly and positions of majority of Nigerians to im­mediately remove the service chiefs and bring in new hands to effectively confront the secu­rity challenges starring us in our face as a nation.” Copyright PUNCH.
