Chukwudi Akasike There was disagreement at Emokpae Model Primary School, Oredo, over the presence of a treasurer of a political party, simply known as Toronto, who was alleged to be an ad hoc staff of INEC. It took the intervention of the police to stop what would have been a fight. The PUNCH reports that at least 12 out of the 18 local government areas of Edo State will play a decisive role in Saturdayâ€™s (today) governorship poll as incumbent Governor Godwin Obaseki, who is the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, clashes with the leading opposition All Progressives Congress governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. Although 14 parties fielded candidates for the poll, observers have argued that the election would be a two-horse race between the PDP and the APC. According to an analysis by Saturday PUNCH, the 12 battleground local government areas are Egor, Ikpoba/Okha, Oredo, Ovia North-East, Ovia South-West, and Uhunmwode. Others are Akoko Edo, Owan West, Owan East, Etsako East, Etsako West and Etsako Central. Six out of the 12 battleground LGAs are located in the Edo South Senatorial District where both the incumbent and the leading opposition candidate hail from. Interestingly, the Edo South Senatorial District has the highest number of voters totalling 1,281,414 votes, according to the figures released by the Independent National Electoral Commission. This represents about 74 per cent of the entire voting populace which INEC put at 1,726,738.
