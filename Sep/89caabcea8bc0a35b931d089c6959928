Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government has constituted a committee to draw up guidelines for the disbursement of the N10bn palliative fund for road transport operators and workers. Minister of State for Transportation, Gbemisola Saraki, disclosed this in Abuja while receiving officials of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, led by their National President, Tajudeen Lawal. In a statement issued on Thursday by the Director, Public Relations, Federal Ministry of Transportation, Eric Ojiekwe, the minister urged the unions to work towards having one recognised body that the ministry could deal with. This, she said, would ensure that the fund was disbursed as soon as possible, adding that it would be counter-productive to delay the disbursement. Saraki commended the transport workers for their perseverance during the lockdown, stressing that this was despite the fact that their livelihoods were disrupted. On his part, Lawal told the minister that member of the NURTW suffered directly and indirectly during the pandemic and prayed that the ministry concedes a larger portion of the palliative to its members.
