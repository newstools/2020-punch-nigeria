Joseph Olaoluwa The labour unions in the aviation sector have again threatened to shut down the operations of Arik Air on Monday over the airline’s management’s failure to resolve issues regarding its conditions of service as well as the unjust treatment of its workers during the pandemic. The two aggrieved unions, the National Union of Air Transport Employees and the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria vowed to withdraw their services on September 14, according to a statement. The statement dated September 10th, 2020 and titled, ‘Notice of withdrawal of service’ was signed by NUATE General Secretary, Ocheme Aba and ATSSSAN Deputy General Secretary, Frances Akinjole. The workers had shelved a strike action scheduled for August 17 to allow for further dialogue at the instance of the Minister of Labour and employment. Copyright PUNCH.
