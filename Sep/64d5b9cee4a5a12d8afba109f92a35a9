Chukwudi Akasike The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People on Wednesday insisted that the Federal Government must clear the late Ken Saro-Wiwa’s of any wrongdoing. MOSOP stated that Saro-Wiwa and others who were killed by the military junta in 1995 were innocent of the murder charges against them. This is just as the apex Ogoni group called on the people of Ogoni not to to lose sight of the visions and intentions of the founding fathers of the struggle, and particularly the drive to achieve meaningful development for Ogoniland. President of MOSOP, Fegalo Nsuke, made this call on Wednesday while addressing MOSOP faithful in Bera, Gokana Kingdom of Ogoni.
