Oladimeji Ramon The Body of Senior Advocates of Nigeria has commended a presidential candidate in the last general elections of the Nigerian Bar Association, Mr Dele Adesina (SAN), for not going to court to challenge the outcome. Adesina, who came third in the NBA presidential poll won by Mr Olumide Akpata, had described the election as a sham and called for its cancellation. After his call for the cancellation of the poll was dismissed by the NBA Electoral Committee, Adesina proceeded before the NBA Board of Trustees, which admitted that the election was not perfect but said it lacked the powers to cancel it. Rather, the NBA Board of Trustees also told Adesina that cancelling the election would not be in the best interest of the association. The Body of Senior Advocates, in a communiqué released after its virtual meeting of September 5, “commended Deacon Adesina for his decision to accept the verdict of the Board of Trustees of the NBA on the 2020 NBA elections and not to contest the result of the said election in court.” In the communiqué, jointly signed by the first female SAN, Chief ‘Folake Solanke, and BOSAN Secretary, Mr Seyi Sowemimo (SAN), the SANs, however, said they were determined to ensure that NBA elections were flawless going forward. To that end, they constituted a five-man committee to audit the last three NBA elections from 2016. The committee, to be chaired by Chief Joe-Kyari Gadzama (SAN), has Mr Osaro Eghobamien (SAN), Chief Yomi Aliu (SAN), Prof. Offornze Amucheazi (SAN) and Mr Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN) as members. Meanwhile, the SANs stated that they would continue to push for “senior members of the Bar, including those in the academia” to be appointed as Justices of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. According to them, such appointments will broaden and enhance the work of the two appellate courts.
