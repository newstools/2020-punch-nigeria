Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin National President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Rev. Dr. Felix Omobude, has charged the people of Edo State, to conduct themselves in a peaceful and orderly manner as they go to the polls to vote in the September 19 governorship election. Omobude who is also the General Superintendent of Gospel Light International Ministry – New Covenant Gospel Church, said this in a press statement, signed by his Media Aide, Ralph Okhiria, in Benin, on Tuesday. He said “My dear good people of Edo state, I identify and join my voice to the many other good citizens of the state to call for peace during this governorship election scheduled for Saturday, this week.” “The contestants have transverse the length and breadth of the state and have told us what they intend to do and can do. It is now our duty to make our choices and then come out boldly to exercise our franchise. “I want to call on you to do what is right. Don’t give yourself to violence, don’t allow your children to be used for violent activities. “In your voting, don’t sell your conscience. Stand for what is right and the overall interest and development of our great state.” While urging Christians across Nigeria to pray for Edo, the clergyman urged the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agencies to be professional in discharging their duties.
