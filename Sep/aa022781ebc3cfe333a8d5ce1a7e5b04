Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Special Adviser to Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, has warned the people of the state to be wary of the financial backing billionaire, Captain Hosa Okunbo, is giving to the All Progressives Congress, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, saying it was designed to reap the state’s treasury. Osagie said this in a statement in Benin on Monday, in response to Okunbo’s interview published in several national newspapers on Monday, stressing that “Obaseki’s stellar performance was visible across the three senatorial districts of the state.” The statement read in part “In the interview Okunbo granted journalists in Abuja, he said he does not invest in any venture without first assessing the profit motive. He also said that he will spend his last kobo backing Ize-Iyamu. “So, clearly, Okunbo is investing in Ize-Iyamu with the treasury of Edo State in mind. This is the reason they want Governor Obaseki out of the way, so that he can grab the treasury of Edo State to service his outlandish lifestyle. Edo State will have nothing left in the treasury to pay pensioners, teachers and other government workers. “Edo people know that the return on Okunbo’s investment in Ize-Iyamu is the entire Edo State’s treasury. All the accusations of nonperformance he made against the governor in the interview are all lies, concocted to put the governor in bad light.” Copyright PUNCH.
