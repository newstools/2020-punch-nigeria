Although 17 political parties fielded candidates for the election, it is a two-way race between APC and PDP. Incumbent Governor Obaseki of PDP ran against APC candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu. Obaseki was elected on APC’s platform in 2016 but defected to the PDP after being denied the ticket owing to intra-party squabbles. The election held in 18 Local Government Areas, 192 Wards, and 2,627 polling units.  SEE DECLARED RESULTS 1) Igueben LGA PDP – 7,870 APC – 5,199 Total – 13170
