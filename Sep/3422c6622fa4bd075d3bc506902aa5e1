Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has topped the Forbes list for highest-earning footballers in 2020. Forbes estimated Messi’s yearly earnings at $126m with Juventus’ Cristiano Ronaldo second on $117m. Neymar was in third place, with Paris St-Germain teammate Kylian Mbappe fourth. Three Premier League players – Mohamed Salah, Paul Pogba and David de Gea – made the top 10, as did Real Madrid and Wales forward Gareth Bale. Welshman Bale came eighth in the list at $29m despite a disappointing 2019/20 season, on a personal level, which saw him fall out with Real boss Zinedine Zidane and only features in two of his club’s last 14 matches of the campaign.

Barcelona forward Antoine Griezmann was seventh and Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski was ninth. The top three were in the same order as in 2019, although Mbappe rose three places from seventh to fourth. Argentine Messi, 33, tried to leave Barcelona this summer and submitted a transfer request in August, but decided to stay because no club would be able to afford his release clause.
