The former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, has petitioned the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, challenging the criminal charge against him. In the petition made available to newsmen on Wednesday, Maina sought a review of the criminal charges filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Maina urged Malami to review all the cases involving him to ensure that his prosecution was not malicious.

Maina alleged that a campaign of calumny was launched against him to obfuscate the issues and divert attention from the inability to account for the property recovered by the task force. He appealed for a review of the cases on the grounds that he had at all times performed his duties in the best interest of the nation and not his personal interest. (NAN)
