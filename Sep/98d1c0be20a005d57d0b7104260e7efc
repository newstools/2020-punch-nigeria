Kai Havertz scored a hat-trick for Chelsea to grab his first goals for the club and help them into the fourth round of the Carabao Cup. The £70m forward has struggled on his first two appearances for the Blues but got off the mark in style against Championship side Barnsley at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Chelsea went a goal up after 19 minutes when Tammy Abraham capitalised on a defensive error to grab the opener. It didn’t take long for the hosts to extend their lead as Mason Mount’s pass was dummied by Abraham to tee up Havertz, who slid the ball past the keeper from inside the box for his first strike for the club. Chelsea made it three shortly after half-time after good pressing allowed Ross Barkley to regain possession high up the pitch before striking low in the corner from outside the box. Havertz then bagged his brace as Abraham’s clever backheel flick set up his teammate for a composed sidefoot finish. The pair then combined again for the German’s treble – the first of his senior career – after he rounded the keeper following Abraham’s ball in behind the defence. Another new boy Ben Chilwell then produced his first contribution as his cross picked out Olivier Giroud in the box, whose header completed the rout.
