Olaleye Aluko The Association of Certified Chartered Accountants has signed a partnership agreement with the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management with the view to building the capacity of its members. The Memorandum of Understanding between the two professional bodies was signed at the CIPM house in Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos State. The ACCA Nigeria Head, Mr Tom Isibor, said the partnership would help to deliver “on the need for capacity and capability development particularly at the time that both members of the two organisations needed skill and re-skilling to be relevant in the workplace.” Isibor said, “In terms of curriculum development, we want to look at how we can develop a skill set in our members and at ACCA, we have started developing our syllabus and having an organisation like CIPM who has the expertise in organising training and capability development in re-skilling and upskilling employees. We can potentially look at how we can develop those skill sets that are required in today’s workplace.” The CIPM Vice President, Mrs Titi Akisanya, noted that the MoU would make the human resource professionals become better managers. He said, “This union will enhance productivity and sustainability because it will help us to understand how their various businesses make and appropriate the money to enrich the people within the organisations.” Copyright PUNCH.
