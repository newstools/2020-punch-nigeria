Top seed Simona Halep took the first semi-final berth at the Italian Open on Saturday when Kazakh rival Yulia Putintseva retired during their match on Saturday. The world number two was leading 6-2, 2-0 in the quarter-final clash on clay in Rome when Putintseva signaled that she was retiring after 45 minutes of play with a lower back injury. Putintseva, ranked 30, had reached the quarter-finals of the recent hardcourt US Open, a tournament which Halep skipped because of coronavirus concerns.
