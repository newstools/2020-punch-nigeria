Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Federal Government on Wednesday said the seven-day ultimatum issued to it by the Trade Union Congress to reverse the recent increase in electricity tariff and the price of petrol was misplaced. The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, said this while answering questions from State House correspondents at the end of the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The TUC had handed down the ultimatum in a letter addressed to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) and dated September 4, 2020. The letter titled “We cannot bear the burden any longer, issuance of seven days ultimatum,” was signed by the union’s President, Quadri Olaleye; and the Secretary-General, Musa Lawal. The union said at the expiration of the ultimatum, its members shall commence an indefinite industrial action and national protest from September 23, 2020.

He gave an indication that the letter should have been addressed to him, and not Buhari. The minister said, “On the TUC issue, the seven-day ultimatum was misplaced because they wrote the President and issued an ultimatum to him. “The President is not recognised by the ILO. “The competent authority for this nature of dispute in Nigeria resides in the man who oversees them, which is whoever is the Minister of Labour and Employment.”
