Dayo Ojerinde A five-year-old boy, Abdulsalam Oluwatoyin, who has been diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot needs a total of N4m naira for surgery. According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Tetralogy of Fallot is a birth defect that affects normal blood flow through the heart. “It happens when a baby’s heart does not form correctly as the baby grows and develops in the mother’s womb during pregnancy,” the CDC said. Abdulsalam’s mother, Mrs Adeola Oluwatoyin, in an interview with our correspondent on Thursday, said his son was first diagnosed with the condition in 2016 at the Olabisi Onabanjo Teaching Hospital, Sagamu. She said, “The second diagnosis was done in 2018 at the OOUTH, while the third diagnosis was done in July, 2020 at the Babcock University Teaching Hospital, Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State. “We have been to a lot of places to seek financial assistance but no response yet. He is currently on admission at the Babcock University Teaching Hospital, Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State; his breathing is always fast.” She added that she used to sell kitchen utensils and gift items in her shop but all the proceeds from the shop had been spent on her son’s treatment making her close the shop. “His father is also a cobbler, we’ve been to everywhere we can to seek financial help, but help nothing is forthcoming. Babacock Teaching Hospital has agreed to do a corrective heart surgery for him, but they won’t start anything until the money is complete,” Adeola said.
