Hindi Livinus, Yola A former acting governor of Adamawa State Mr  James Barka, has defected from the All Progress Congress to the ruling  People Democratic Party in the state. Barka declared the withdrawal of his membership of the APC at the banquet hall of the Government House in Yola at a ceremony where Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, and other chieftains of the PDP on Thursday received the former governor who ruled between 26 February and April 29, 2008 after an election appeal tribunal annulled the election of Governor Murtala Nyako. He said, “I’ve always been a PDP man. Under this party I was elected a member of the state Assembly and I became the Speaker. “Under the same PDP I became acting governor and later ambassador. I only veered off into the APC, leaving my teeming supporters behind, and as you can see; I’ve returned home. I am impressed with Fintiri achievement within short time.” Fintiri who welcomed Barka, said the doors of the PDP in state was wide open to accommodate all who wanted to return back into the party. At the event, reception ceremony for  members of a splinter faction of the PDP known as rPDP (reformed PDP) across the 21 local government areas of the state was held.
