Friday Olokor, Abuja The Independent National Electoral Commission has described the governorship elections in Edo and Ondo states scheduled for September 19 and October 10, 2020, respectively as a learning curve under the COVID-19 pandemic. The commission warned political parties and their candidates to see the present period as a transitional electoral curve as “there are other creative and innovative ways of earning a living other than through violence.” INEC National Commissioner and Chairman of its Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, stated these in an interview with The PUNCH, during which he also demanded fidelity from all the critical stakeholders. He was responding to enquiries about which of the two elections had constituted a serious threat to INEC. Okoye said, “Over 70 countries postponed elections on account of the pandemic. But given Nigeria’s constitutional and electoral circumstances, we considered it imperative to proceed with the elections. We have deepened the use of technology in both elections and we are putting in measures that will guarantee additional transparency in results collation. “We enjoin political parties and candidates to see this period as a transitional electoral curve that demands fidelity from all critical stakeholders. Political parties and the candidates must devise other means and avenues of engaging their supporters other than the use of violence. Certainly, there are other creative and innovative ways of earning a living other than through violence.” Copyright PUNCH.
