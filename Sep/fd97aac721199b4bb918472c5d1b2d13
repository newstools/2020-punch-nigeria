Peter Dada, Akure The All Progressives Congress has alleged that a former governor of Ondo State, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, is seeking third term by supporting the deputy governor of the state, Mr Agboola Ajayi, for the forthcoming governorship election. Mimiko is the National Leader of the Zenith Labour Party, which has Ajayi has its candidate. But the APC alleged that the former governor was more desperate than the candidate of the ZLP in order to find his way to the government should the ZLP win the forthcoming election. The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mr Yekini Nabena, in a statement on Monday said, “It is not surprising that the entire governorship campaign of the ZLP has centred on Mimiko rather than the obscure and supposed ZLP governorship candidate, Agboola Ajayi. “Perhaps, Mimiko deludes himself that the good people of Ondo State have forgotten how they were subjected to his arbitrary, tyrannical and dictatorial actions when he governed the state. They have not.” While calling for support for its candidate, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, the ruling party said he was visible to all, particularly in the area of infrastructure, agriculture, human capital development, industry, entrepreneurship, among others.
