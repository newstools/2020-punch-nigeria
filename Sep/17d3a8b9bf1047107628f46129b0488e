Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The lawmaker representing Oguta state constituency at the Imo State House of Assembly, Frank Ugboma, has described as false, a statement made by the Speaker of the State Assembly, Collins Chiji, that former governor Emeka Ihedioha gave lawmakers refurbished vehicles as official cars. The speaker made the claim at a state function in Owerri, on Wednesday. However, Ugboma who is the deputy minority leader of the House, on Thursday urged the speaker to stop “bootlicking.” Ugboma said, “I refuse to believe that the Speaker, Imo State House of Assembly, Mr. Chiji Collins, actually made such statement as credited to him, but if he did, I say, that it is most unfortunate, appalling and embarrassing to the entire 9th House because that statement is false. “May I inform the general public that the official vehicles under reference are 2019 Brand new Prado Jeeps given to the House members in the year 2019. One wonders how imaginable a 2019 model Prado Jeep could be refurbished in the same 2019.” Copyright PUNCH.
