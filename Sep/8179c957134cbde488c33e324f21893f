Nike Popoola WorldRemit, a digital payments platform, has said it is providing a platform to enable Nigerians in the United Kingdom to save money. It said the financial demands on Nigerians sending remittance money home from the United Kingdom was at an all-time high. It said this in a statement on Friday entitled ‘WorldRemit celebrates 60 years of Nigerian independence, helping Nigerians in the UK save money.” The firm said it was assisting approximately 215,000 Nigerians living and working in the UK to save. It said collectively, Nigerians send home £3.27bn per year in remittances, which was more than any other nationality living in the UK. It stated, “As Nigerian children prepare to head back to school after the longest summer break on record, Nigeria faces a potential currency crisis in the wake of this year’s oil price crash and the world continues to wrestle with a global health emergency. “Anyone sending money home to Nigeria with WorldRemit this September, will enjoy a two per cent discount and pay no WorldRemit fees on every transaction, putting more money in the pockets of those who need it most. “Furthermore, customers will stand a chance to win one of 240 prizes, including 60 iPhone 11 devices, 60 £60 Amazon shopping vouchers, and each winner will also get a £60 Jumia voucher for their recipient to put to good use back home in Nigeria.” The Country Manager, Nigeria at WorldRemit, Gbenga Okejimi, said, “Being able to send money home is a huge source of pride for Nigerians working in the UK, just as October’s Independence Day will be a huge source of pride for our nation.
