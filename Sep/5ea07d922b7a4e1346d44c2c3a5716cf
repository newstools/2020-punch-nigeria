Kelvin Ekerete Players of Lobi Stars have been isolated after completing their COVID-19 tests on Wednesday, with the club promising to bear the cost of treatment for any player that tested positive. Austin Tyowua, media officer of the club, said the club would take full responsibility for any player or official who tested positive. “We have placed the players in separate rooms. When the result comes out and anyone is infected, then we will take the player out for treatment. The club is taking full responsibility for any infected player,” Tyowua told The PUNCH. The team has since resumed non-training camp ahead of the new season. Vice chairman of the club, Mike Idoko, told our correspondent that players and officials had since moved into close camp. “The testing of players was carried out by our state government, players and officials will move into close camp.” Copyright PUNCH.
