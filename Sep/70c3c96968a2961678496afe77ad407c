Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The National Union of Foods, Beverages and Tobacco Employees has split into factions following alleged move by its National President, Lateef Oyelekan, to extend his tenure. However, those opposed to the alleged tenure elongation plot have reportedly secured a court injunction restraining the union from organising an emergency delegate conference or extending the tenure of the president and his executive members. Addressing a press conference in Abuja on Monday, a former National Signing Trustee of NUFBTE, Peter Onoja and the union General Secretary, Bamidele Busari, called on the Federal Government and well-meaning Nigerians to assist in ending illegality in the union. He admitted that the union’s constitution had no tenure limit but added that the constitution emphasised that election must hold every four years to choose new leaders. Onoja said, “Now we have two factions in the house; I am the president of one of the factions. I am the former National Signing Trustee of the union. Our president has served four years as deputy president, 12 years as president, making a total of 16 years.” He added, “Our constitution has no tenure limit, you can contest as many times, but the constitution makes it clear that every four years, you must have elections.” He explained that his group secured an interlocutory injunction from the National Industrial Court on August 19 stopping the emergency conference until the determination of the case.
