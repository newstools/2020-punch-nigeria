Toni Ufoh Midfielder Alex Iwobi may make his first appearance of the season when Everton host West Bromwich Albion at Goodison Park on Saturday (today). Iwobi missed out on the Toffees’ victories over Tottenham Hotspur and Salford due to a slight knock, a report on Everton’s website revealed. “Alex Iwobi is back in contention after recovering from a slight knock,” Everton tweeted. Iwobi is expected to start the game from the bench with manager Carlo Ancelotti poised to stick with the players that defeated Spurs away last weekend. The 24-year-old scored once in 25 league appearances for Everton last season. Meanwhile, centre-back pair Jarrad Branthwaite and Mason Holgate will miss Saturday’s clash. Defender Branthwaite sustained an ankle injury during Everton’s 3-0 win over Salford on Wednesday night and the 18-year-old is expected to be unavailable for three to five weeks. Holgate, meanwhile, continues to be sidelined with a toe injury and Everton boss Ancelotti said the Club could enter the transfer market to boost their centre-back options. Copyright PUNCH.
