Ebenezer Bajela Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has dismissed suggestions that Wilfred Ndidi will play more often as a centre-back for the Foxes this season despite possessing the attributes. The Nigerian midfielder was deployed at centre back at The Hawthorns in the Foxes’ English Premier League opening game against West Brom due to the absence of Wes Morgan (hamstring injury), Jonny Evans (suspension) and Filip Benkovic (injury). Ndidi is expected to play as a centre back on Sunday when Leicester face Burnley at the King Power Stadium as the trio Morgan, Evans and Benkovic are ruled out of the clash. “Wilf is a player that I have real confidence in,” Rodgers told a press conference on Friday “He played the position (centre-back) very well and he has the attributes to play there. We don’t want him there for a long period of time.” According to Whoscored, Ndidi made a team-high four clearances against West Brom, made two interceptions and two tackles and finished the match with a game-high 93 passes.
