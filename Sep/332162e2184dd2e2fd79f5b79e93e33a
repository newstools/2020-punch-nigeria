Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The All Progressives Congress has condemned the disruption of its ongoing free medical outreach in Edo Central Senatorial District by the police allegedly acting on the instruction of the Edo State goveror’s wife, Betsy Obaseki. The party said the medical outreach inaugurated on Tuesday by the wife of its candidate in the governorship race, Prof. Idia Ize-Iyamu, to provide free health screening and other medical services to the people, was disrupted in Uromi by the police in the Uromi area of the state. According a statement by Mr John Mayaki, the Chairman of the Edo APC Campaign Council, the policemen were acting on the instruction of the wife of the Edo governor, Betsy Obaseki, who was “attending a political event in the area and felt displeased by the abandonment of her event by the people who thronged the free medical outreach.” He said, “The First Lady’s actions borders on arrogation of powers with no constitutional basis, insensitivity to the plight of the people, and a cruel prioritisation of political showmanship over the health of the poor and vulnerable.” But the Press Secretary to Mrs Obaseki, Peter Okonkwo, said, “Her Excellency, Betsy Obaseki, is busy with the Women Wing of the PDP Campaign Committee and is currently campaigning in Uromi as we speak. “She does not run the police and so this accusation is totally frivolous. The APC is intimidated by the massive support of the Esan people for the PDP government and their resolve to return Governor Obaseki for second term, so they are now making up excuses not to continue their campaign.” Copyright PUNCH.
