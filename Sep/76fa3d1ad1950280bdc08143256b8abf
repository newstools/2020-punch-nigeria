Joseph Olaoluwa The President of the Professional e-Hailing Drivers and Private-Owners Association, Idris Oluwaseun, has said that the current increase in the pump price of petrol has compounded the woes of his members. The current pump price of petrol currently ranges from N158 to N162 per litre. It was recently increased from about N148 per litre. Oluwaseun said the situation was worse because the commission set aside by the e-hailing firms, Uber and Bolt, had not been reviewed downwards. He said, “Now that the fuel price has increased, they still maintain their commission. You know that immediately fuel goes up, everything in the Nigerian market goes up. “In our own case, they will rather reduce what we get because drivers do not have a contractual obligation to control prices of their service.” He said the unjustifiable blocking of drivers from the operators’ platform, lack of oversight function and not allowing drivers to fix their prices had made the business unprofitable. He said, “It is a standing rule all over the world that whoever is rendering the service should be in charge of their service. But as ride hailing business is concerned, we do not have a contractual obligation to control the price of our service.” The Federal Government had two weeks ago increased the ex-depot price of petrol from N 138.62 to N147.67, prompting marketers to adjust their petrol prices to between N158 and N162 from N148 to N150 in August. The ex-depot price is the price at which government sells petrol to marketers. Copyright PUNCH.
