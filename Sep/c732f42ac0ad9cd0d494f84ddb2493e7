John Alechenu, Abuja Elder statesman, Chief Edwin Clark, has expressed worry over the violence and character assassination which have become synonymous with the Edo State governorship election. Clark, a foremost Ijaw leader, was particularly pained by attempts by a section of the political elite to malign the integrity of the Akwa Ibom State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mike Igini. The former Federal Commissioner for Information spoke in a statement in Abuja, on Sunday. He said in the statement, “I must observe that the bitterness and violence that have defined the path to the Edo gubernatorial election is not only worrisome but frightening given that persons who are not part of the election are now being castigated needlessly. “It is shocking that someone with impressive track records, a tested character and one of the rare and finest public officers of his own generation, the Resident Electoral Commissioner for Akwa Ibom State, Mike Igini, could be characterised and portrayed in a manner completely contrary to his antecedent that Nigerians know him for in this country, and when he has no function in the Edo State election which has its own commissioner, by the duo of one retired Col. Imuse and John Mayaki, both of whom made some unbelievable allegations against him.” Clark expressed delight that Nigerians of goodwill had since condemned the smear campaign against the electoral officer who he said has discharged his responsibility with integrity.
