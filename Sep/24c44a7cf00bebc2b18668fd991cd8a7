Joseph Olaoluwa A group, Social Action, has asked the Federal Government to be accountable following its approval of a N10bn COVID-19 intervention fund for road transport workers and operators in Nigeria. This was contained in a press statement issued on Monday by its Communications and Advocacy Manager, Lillian Akhigbe. The statement was titled ‘Social Action demands public accountability, as FG approves N10bn COVID-19 intervention fund for road transporters’. The group asked the government to put in place a work plan that would show the mechanism through which the initiative could be of benefit to the masses. The statement read, “The government owes it to the people to ensure public revenues are not mismanaged and squandered recklessly. “Government’s policies must be aimed at achieving goals for the collective good of the citizenry. The government needs to assure Nigerians that the intervention will achieve much-needed growth in the transport sector. “Hence, it is very necessary for the government to put in place a work plan that will show the mechanism through which the initiative can be of benefit to the masses.” It added, “There must be a clear-cut strategy that shows how the initiative will be implemented with a view to preventing the looting of the funds. “It must be clearly defined, who the beneficiaries are, the number of beneficiaries and the conditions for the disbursements of the palliatives to them.” The group also asked for checks and balances against road transport operators who arbitrarily fix their price rates.
