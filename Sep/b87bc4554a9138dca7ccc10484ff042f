Umar Muhammed, Lafia The Chairman, Obi Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, Muhammad Oyimugah, has been impeached by the legislative arm of the local government. It was gathered that security operatives, including the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, have been drafted to the local government secretariat to forestall any breakdown of law and order. The Speaker of the council, Luka Ishaq, on Monday in Lafia, said the impeachment followed the chairman’s involvement in the mismanagement of the council’s fund. He said, “It will interest you to note that the chairman has never presented a budget to the legislative arm of the council since our inauguration three years now. How can the chairman spend taxpayers’ money without anything to show for it? “There are other allegations such as diversion of government funds into his private accounts. We invited him to appear before us but he refused to honour our invitation. “We are 10 in number and eight out of the 10 lawmakers signed the impeachment. So the chairman stand impeached.” However, when contacted, the council chairman told our correspondent that he was still in charge. He said, “I have not been impeached. I am still in charge of the council.”
