Samson Folarin The Association of Industrial Security and Safety Operators of Nigeria has asked the Federal Government to increase protection around the Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum. The National President of the group, Dr Ona Ekhomu, also called for “rigorous executive protection training” for the security aides of the governor. Ekhomu, in a statement on Tuesday, said the frequent attacks on Zulum’s convoy with the attendant casualties, portrayed the country in bad light. While commiserating with the families of security agents who lost their lives in a recent ambush of the governor’s convoy, Ekhomu called for better protection of the state chief executive and “robust protectional intelligence, including technical intelligence to learn about plots against the governor.” The security expert also warned that Zulum’s enthusiasm to return Internally Displaced Persons in the state to their ancestral homes should be balanced against the threat of Boko Haram in northern Borno. He argued that it would be counter-productive to push the return of IDPs to their homes since “northern Borno is obviously not safe enough for them.” “I advise making haste slowly to give the military the opportunity to defeat the enemy completely,” he added.
