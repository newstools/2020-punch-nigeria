Nike Popoola The President, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria, Mr Bayo Olugbemi, has said stakeholders in the banking sector will deliberate on the role of banking and finance in facilitating a sustainable future. He spoke during a virtual event on the upcoming 13th Annual Bankers Conference in September, with the theme ‘Facilitating a sustainable future: The role of banking and finance.’ “In line with the theme, participants will evaluate the role of the banking and finance industry in engendering an inclusive sustainable growth as well as offering a direction on how to reposition the industry for relevance in the new world order, by leveraging on digitalisation to boost Nigeria’s economy,” he said. He said the institute for the first time was adopting a hybrid approach to the conference, which would take place simultaneously in Abuja and Lagos and through Zoom teleconferencing. He said the event would bring together prominent bankers, major economic players, captains of industries, regulators, policymakers, members of the academic community and other stakeholders in the banking and finance industry. Over 2,500 participants, across the globe are expected to participate virtually, with the Central Bank Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, as chief host, according to him. Copyright PUNCH.
