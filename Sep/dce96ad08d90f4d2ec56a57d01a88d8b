Olaleye Aluko The Diocesan Bishop of Lagos, Anglican Communion, Rev Dr Humphrey Olumakaiye, says the Companies and Allied Matters Act 2020 is raising controversies because the Federal Government has failed to keep a number of its promises and may not be trusted. The bishop added that the government needed to reconsider the Act and listen to the outcries and demands of Nigerians. Olumakaiye in a statement titled “CAMA Law: Crisis of Leadership Trust”, which was to mark the second session of the 34th Synod of the Diocese of the Lagos, Anglican Communion, noted that the Federal Government had “not been putting a round peg in a round hole.” The bishop said, “Our leaders have not shown to us that they can be trusted; the rate of embezzlement and funds misappropriation is greatly alarming. Tribalism and religious preferences have dealt severely with the nation’s growth and economic development. Our leaders have not been putting a round peg in a round hole, so how can they convince the church that there will be transparency with the CAMA law?” Olumakaiye noted that the 34th Synod of the Diocese, scheduled for Our Saviour’s Church, TBS, Lagos, would hold from “Sunday, September 6, to September, 8, 2020, under the theme, “Pray, Serve and Grow.” Copyright PUNCH.
