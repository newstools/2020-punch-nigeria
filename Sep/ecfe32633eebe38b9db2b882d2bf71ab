PETER DADA The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the October 10 governorship election in Ondo State, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, has described an increase in tuition fees by the state government as a wicked act. He promised to reduce the tuition fees of tertiary institutions in the state if elected. He made the promise at the palace of Olukun of Ikun Akoko in the Akoko South West Local Government Area of the state. “Most of the leaders who deliberately increased school fees benefitted from free education during their time; so all we can say is that it (increment in tuition fees) is a wicked act,” he said. In his remarks, the Olukun of Ikun, Oba Michael Adedoyin, commended Jegede for his maturity and violence-free campaigns. Particularly referring to the clash between the supporters of the PDP and the All Progressives Congress in Oba Akoko last week, Oba Adedoyin said Jegede stood commended for not involving in the clash. “I really thank you for not retaliating, which could have led to bloodshed; and it is not good to shed blood simply because you want to get to power,” he said.
