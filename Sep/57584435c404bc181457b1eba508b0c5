Samson Folarin The Lagos State Government has said there is no agency named Lagos State Vehicle Waste Basket Enforcement/Compliance Unit. The state Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, described uniformed officers who claimed to be men of the unit as imposters and fraudsters. Bello spoke while reacting to a viral video showing the group in a branded vehicle while promoting the sale of wastebaskets on behalf of the government. The commissioner, in a statement on Thursday, said the characters in the clip did not represent either the state government or any of its agencies. “Bello affirmed that there is no unit or agency under the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources that goes by the name Lagos State Vehicle Waste Basket Enforcement/Compliance as portrayed in the branded vehicle which the fraudsters operated from. “While noting that the state government has always encouraged all buses, trucks and articulated vehicles to provide wastebaskets in their vehicles to discourage littering of the roads and streets, Bello maintained that the present administration has never recommended any branded wastebasket to Lagosians,” the statement said. The commissioner was said to have asked security agents to arrest the suspects. Copyright PUNCH.
