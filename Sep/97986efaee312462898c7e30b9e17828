Joseph Olaoluwa The National Council of Managing Directors of Licensed Customs Agents has written to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), seeking a review of the Pre-Arrival Assessment Report introduced to enhance speedy examination and release of imported cargo from the sea and airports. In a letter titled ‘The urgent need to review the Pre-Arrival Assessment Report’, and dated September 21, 2020, it said the policy was not procedurally backed by the law. It also stressed that the policy had impeded the clearance process, inhibiting the clearance of good from the ports. The letter was signed by president of the association, Lucky Amiwero, with copies sent to President of the Senate, Ministers and Finance and Transport and Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service. The letter read in part, “We hereby bring to the attention of the Federal Government the process of PAAR that is not procedurally backed by law and its treatment. “We find it expedient to draw the attention of government on our responsibility to conform to international best practice and law of the land, especially as signatory Trade Facilitation Agreement, the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement and other trade conventions.” Some of the objectives of setting up the policy was to enhance revenue collection, border security and trade facilitation. Other objectives include the utilisation of pre-classification and pre-valuation mechanism to facilitate the importation of goods into Nigeria and improve the efficiency of Customs clearance.
