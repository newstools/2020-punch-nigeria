Toni Ufoh Ex-internationals have urged Kenneth Nwamucha and Edema Fuludu, who lead two factions in the Delta FA to resolve the crisis in the state FA. The DFA had been in crisis since January when the Nigeria Football Federation set up a normalisation committee to run the affairs of the association after failing to recognise the Edema Fuludu-led board of the FA, which was elected in 2019. The normalisation committee conducted an election into the FA board on Tuesday, which brought in Nwamucha as the new chairman. While Fuludu threatened to drag the NFF to FIFA, describing the election as an “illegal contraction”, Nwamucha insisted he was the “legitimate leader” of the state FA. Speaking with our correspondent, former Super Eagles stars Tijani Babangida, Garba Lawal and Etim Esin urged the parties involved to resolve the crisis peacefully. “As human beings, this kind of things will happen at some point or the other but how we handle it is what makes us humane,” Babangida told The PUNCH. Lawal added, “It is better that we remain at peace for development than going through a crisis that will limit the development of the sport in Delta and Nigeria. “So, if there are issues, the people involved should solve it amicably without all these bad press flying around.” Esin said, “I am not too surprised with what’s going on in Delta. That’s the Nigerian style for you, merit is thrown away for political patronage. I can only tell Fuludu to cool down. If they don’t want him, he can just leave and go on with his life. After all, before then, he has been surviving. He should just be at peace with himself.” Copyright PUNCH.
