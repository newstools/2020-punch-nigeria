Samson Folarin The Ogun State Government has appealed to organised labour to end the warning strike in the state and return to the negotiation table. In a statement on Thursday, the Secretary to the Ogun State Government, Tokunbo Talabi, said the state considered as unfair and indecorous the decision of labour to withdraw services in the middle of negotiation. Talabi said, “As an administration, we remain committed to the welfare of Ogun State workers as we are to the fulfilment of our electoral promises to the generality of Ogun State citizens and residents. “When the state signed the agreement with labour for the implementation of the new minimum wage, no one envisaged COVID-19 and its debilitating socio-economic impact that has constrained the Internally Generated Revenue of the state and the unplanned expenditures in its wake. “This has forced Ogun State, like most states in the country, to review our 2020 budget down from approximately N450bn  to N280bn, about 38 per cent downward review.” Copyright PUNCH.
