The South-West Youth Leadership of the All Progressives Congress has called on the Deputy Governor of Ondo State, and Governorship Candidate of the Zenith Labour Party, Mr Agboola Ajayi, to strip himself of official immunity and prepare to defend himself in court. This is a development from the claim of Agboola that a son to the incumbent Governor of Ondo State, Mr Babajide Akeredolu, made N430 million as consultancy fees on the discovery of a N4.3billion naira belonging to the state in a secret account. According to the South-West Youth Leader of the APC, Kolade Lawal, such claim is spurious and irresponsible. “It is least expected of a man holding a position of responsibility. The information is untrue and deliberately misleading for the innocent members of the public.” He called on Ajayi to prepare to present evidence for his claims in the court. He said, “The South-West Youth Leadership has written a letter to Ondo State House of Assembly to inquire if there was any consultant involved in the process of the discovery of the #4.3 billion, and they were reliably informed that no consultant was involved.”
