Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The wife of the Edo Sate Deputy Governor, Mrs Maryann Shaibu, has petitioned the Commissioner of Police over alleged threat to her life by a former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress , Mr Adams Oshiomhole. The petition by Idemudia Ilueminosen, lawyer for Mrs Philip-Shaibu, titled, ‘Threat to Life,’ stated that Oshiomhole allegedly threatened to deal the deputy governor’s wife on Sunday, September 6, 2020, at Jattu in the Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State, during the APC campaign tour to the community. According to the petition, Oshiomhole, did not only threaten to deal with Mrs. Philip-Shaibu, but he also declared that he has sent some thugs to monitor her movements in Etsako West. “This is moreso that the lives of our client and her family (by this threat) are at stake and the situation may degenerate into a full blown crisis if nothing urgent is done,” the petition real. Meanwhile, Oshiomhole’s media aide, Mr Victor Oshioke, said the former governor was focused on marketing the governorship candiate of the APC to the people and “cannot, under any circumstances, be distracted by the buzzing of baby mosquitoes Mrs Shaibu.” “This petition is nothing but a futile attempt to divert the attention of Nigerians from the trending video of Maryann Shaibu threatening to flog women old enough to be her mother if they dare exercise their fundamental human rights to attend any event other than the one she organises,” he said.
