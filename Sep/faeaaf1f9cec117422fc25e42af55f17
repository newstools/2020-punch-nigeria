According to a statement issued by the company on Sunday, the project is in partnership with investment company, Coop East, and financed by FirstTrust Mortgage Bank Plc. The development firm’s Managing Director, Dayo Olaiya, said the residential estate was built for investors and home buyers interested in the Lagos Island metropolis, adding that the project would add value to the investors and the neighbourhood.
