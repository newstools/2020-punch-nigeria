He added that the wreckage of the bus had been safely removed and normalcy restored. Oke-Osanyintolu said, “The agency received distress calls on the above. Upon arrival at the scene, it was discovered that a passenger motor GGE 972 GE had veered onto the train tracks while crossing the rail at PWD inward Oshodi and subsequently collided with a scheduled commuter train. “The bus was then dragged along for a stretch of the journey before the train managed to come to a complete halt. The Agency was able to successfully extricate the passengers and note that there was no loss of life. Casualties have been provided with on-site medical care and discharge. “Members of the public, especially drivers of commuter buses are reminded to obey traffic regulations to prevent injuries and transport delays.
