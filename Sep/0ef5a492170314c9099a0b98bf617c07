Olaleye Aluko The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has said the Nigerian government has enough money to provide palliatives for every citizen, but that corruption and lack of accountability are the country’s problems. Adeboye added that the church, for example, spent between N250m and N400m monthly on corporate social responsibility, saying the government must attend to the demands of the people. The cleric spoke at the monthly thanksgiving service at the RCCG Headquarters, Throne of Grace, Ebute-Metta, Lagos State. Adeboye, who was represented by the Assistant General Overseer, Administration and Personnel, Pastor Johnson Odesola, said he was full of praises to God for intervening in the COVID-19 crisis in the country. The thanksgiving service was themed ‘Victory over lockdown.’ Adeboye said, “To say there is not enough money to give juicy palliatives to Nigerians is an understatement because Nigeria has the money. But the problem known to everyone is corruption and lack of accountability. For example, in RCCG, we spend a substantial amount of money on corporate social responsibility of between N250m and N400m every month.” While commenting on the hike in the pump price of fuel and electricity, Adeboye noted that the government needed to be considerate with its people and reconsider introducing such policies at a time people were getting relief from the scourge of COVID-19.
