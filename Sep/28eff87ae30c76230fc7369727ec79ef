Johnny Edward Napoli captain Lorenzo Insigne has paid Victor Osimhen the highest praise possible – by comparing him to the club’s former striker Edison Cavani. Cavani scored 104 goals in 138 games for the Partenopei between 2010 and 2013. The Nigerian striker, who moved to Napoli for £72m, including add-ons from Lille earlier this summer, will be aiming to replicate his scoring heroics for Lille in the Serie A with Napoli. The 21-year-old came off the bench on his debut against Parma in their Serie A opener on Sunday, which they won 2-0. “He didn’t just impress me, but the whole group,” Insigne told Sky Sport Italia in his post-match interview. “When he attacks it is devastating, as we saw today. “He reminds me a bit of Cavani, for how he attacks the depth. He will give us a hand because he brings something different to me and Dries (Mertens), and his speed can be important. “We told him to stay calm, he’s young. He has potential and needs to grow, but we will help him.” Copyright PUNCH.
