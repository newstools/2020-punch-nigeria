John Charles, Makiurdi The Senate President in the Third Republic, Iyorchia Ayu, on Monday faulted the plan by Federal Government to construct a rail line from Kano to Niger Republic. Ayu said the money voted for the project should be channelled on reconstructing of dilapidated federal roads across the country. The former Senate President stated this   during the inauguration of reconstructed Ahmadu Bello Way by Governor Samuel Ortom in the Gboko area of the state. Ayu, who decried the state of federal roads in the country, said Benue had long been neglected in infrastructure. Ayu said, “I call on our National Assembly members to tell the President to fix our roads. It is wrong for the Buhari administration to construct rail line from Kano to Niger Republic.” “The money should be channelled to repair of roads in the State. We do not need a rail line to Niger. The allied forces have ganged up against you but do not be distracted.  As long as you are doing what the people want and defending us, no one will do anything to you.” Also speaking, Ortom lamented the menace of erosion in Gboko, Otukpo and Ogbadibo local government areas. He said, “I condemn the Federal government construction of rail line to Niger Republic.  This fund can be used to reconstruct rail lines especially Makurdi-Kaduna, Port Harcourt-Makurdi and Lagos-Makurdi in the country. Of what benefit will the rail line to Niger do to us?” Copyright PUNCH.
