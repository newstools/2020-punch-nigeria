Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party, Emmanuel Iboi has said that he is satisfied with the electoral process that earned Governor Godwin Obaseki victory. The 36-year-old ADP governorship candidate, the youngest among the 14 candidates that participated in the election, said he has accepted the outcome of the exercise because he believed that the people of Edo have made their choice. He said: “For me, the election was free and fair and I have accepted the outcome in good fate. We (ADP) are not going to court because we believe the people have chosen their leader.” “We also know that the ADP came third because the people believe in us. This is not the time for Governor Obaseki, the governor-elect, to relax, it is time for him to do more work and we are ready to join hands with him to make Edo great again.” Copyright PUNCH.
