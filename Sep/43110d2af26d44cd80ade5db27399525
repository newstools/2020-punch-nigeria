Tony Okafor, Awka A Labour Party aspirant for the Anambra State 2021 governorship election, Group Captain Nnamdi Nnoruka (retd.), has promised to pay workers in the state N50,000 as minimum wage if elected. He also promised to conduct local government elections within nine months of assumption of office. Speaking with newsmen in Onitsha on Thursday, Nnoruka condemned what he described as peanuts being paid to civil servants in the state as salary, saying such meagre sum would only encourage corruption in the system. He said, “We’re going to pay living wage; we’re going to review all of that. If it’s 5,000 people we can afford to pay, it is better we engage such a number and remunerate them properly, so that they can do their job well. “If you ask me what can be a living wage for the lowest level of worker, it shouldn’t be less than N50,000 for it to sustain a family. I’m not going to perform any miracle, but will just do what is right. We’ll keep the rules.” Copyright PUNCH.
