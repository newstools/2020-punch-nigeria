Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt THE Rivers State Police Command has vowed to arrest gang members of the serial killer and notorious kidnapper, Honest Digbara, popularly known as Bobisky, who died hours after his arrest on Sunday. The State Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mukan, made this vow when a group, Ogoni Youths Federation, paid him a courtesy visit on Monday at his office in Port Harcourt, the state capital. Mukan solicited the support of everyone in the fight against crime and criminality in the state, saying some criminals might be out there, who could be worse than Bobisky. “Our next mission is to dismantle his men; we know Bobisky was not operating alone, but now that he is dead, it will be difficult for them to unite. “There are still some that he might have recruited. But we will take them out; we have a mandate and that mandate is to ensure that Rivers State remains peaceful and safe for people to go about their lawful duties,” the CP stated. Earlier, President General of Ogoni Youth Federation, Legborsi Yormabana, appealed to the Inspector General of Police and the Police Service Commission to consider promoting the Divisional Police Officer of the Bori Division, Boko Angbashim, to an Area Commander.
