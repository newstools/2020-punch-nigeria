John Alechenu, Abuja The National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party on Tuesday ratified the sacking of the party’s Osun State chairman, Adesoji Adaggunodo, who was removed from office following a vote of no confidence passed on him by the state executive. This was contained in a statement titled “PDP NWC Ratifies Removal of Osun State Chairman…Directs Deputy to Take Charge,” signed by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja. Ologobondiyan said “The National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party has ratified the removal from office of the Osun State Chairman of our party, Hon. Adesoji Adagunodo, following the validation of a vote of no confidence passed on him by the state executive. “The decision of the NWC is consequent upon the report of the Sub-Committee set up by the NWC which investigated and validated the allegations as well as the Vote of no Confidence passed against Hon. Adagunodo by the state executive, in line section 59 (2) (4) of the PDP Constitution. “Consequently, the NWC has directed the deputy chairman, Sunday Akanfe, to take charge of the affairs of the Osun state chapter pending the emergence of a substantive state Chairman in keeping with the dictates of the PDP Constitution.
