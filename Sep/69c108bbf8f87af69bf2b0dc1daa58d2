Sodiq Oyeleke The Federal Government has asked all persons holding accounts across financial institutions, including insurance firms, to fill and submit Self-Certification Forms. The Nigerian government made this known in a series of tweets on Thursday. It threatened to block access to defaulters’ accounts or impose a monetary penalty. The tweets read, “This is to notify the general public that all account holders in Financial Institutions (Banks, Insurance Companies, etc) are required to obtain, complete and submit Self – Certification Forms to their respective Financial Institutions. “Persons holding accounts in different financial institutions is required to complete & submit the form to each one of the institutions. The forms are required by the relevant financial institutions to carry out due diligence procedures in line with the Income Tax Regulations 2019 “The self-certification form is in 3 categories: Form for Entity, for Controlling Person (Individuals having controlling interest in a legal person, trustee, etc), form for individual. “Failure to comply with the requirement to administer or execute this form attracts sanctions which may include monetary penalty or inability to operate the account.
