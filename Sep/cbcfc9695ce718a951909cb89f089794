Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin Over 2,500 people have been displaced from their abodes by a recent flood in the Jebba community and its environs in Moro Local Government Area of Kwara State. The flood, according to the deputy leader in the Kwara State House of Assembly, John Bello,  was as a result of a downpour in the Jebba area a few days ago. The rainfall also washed away several hectares of farmlands, destroying various crops. Paying an on-the-spot assessment to the area, Bello who represents Lanwa/Ejidongari Constituency in the Assembly sympathised with the affected victims of the flood and assured them of government’s intervention. Bello said that the state governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq has best interest of the people at heart, adding that he will intervene and send relief materials to the displaced people. He noted that plans are underway by the state government to evacuate the victims from the affected areas to a safe abode pending the time the downpour would cease. Also, a representative of the National Emergency Management Agency, Esther Adaranbori, urged the people to always clear the waterways and keep their drainages clean always so as to prevent future occurrence.
