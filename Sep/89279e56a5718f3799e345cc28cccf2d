Nike Popoola A report by the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Enhancing Financial Innovation & Access has said that Nigeria is far from achieving its financial inclusion target in 2020. The CBN disclosed this in the report titled ‘Assessment of women’s financial inclusion in Nigeria’ for December 2019 period which was released on Monday. Part of the report read, “Not surprisingly, financial exclusion stands at 36 per cent for women and 24 per cent for men. “The relative gender gap related to financial inclusion is ~20-30 per cent, placing Nigeria below its peers. “Since 2012, although women’s exclusion has dropped, the gender gap has grown, revealing that men’s inclusion has improved more rapidly than women’s. “The National Financial Inclusion Strategy was launched in 2012 to reduce financial exclusion to 20 per cent of the adult population. “However, according to the revised NFIS, Nigeria is not on track to achieve its 2020 targets.” The report said progress towards financial inclusion had been adversely affected by unforeseen socioeconomic factors such as recession, the precarious security situation in parts of northern Nigeria, and other factors such as slow uptake of digital financial services.
