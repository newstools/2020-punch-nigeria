Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin A non-governmental organisation, Truth and Justice Vanguard, has urged the Nigeria Police Force to investigate all accidents involving the convoy of the former governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole. The Coordinator of the group, Hilary Ayokhai, made the call at a media briefing in Benin on Sunday. He said, “The recent unfortunate accident involving Adams Oshiomhole’s convoy, which claimed the lives of two innocent policemen and injured several others, makes this call for his investigation even more compelling. “We are also aware that members of the opposition are trying to pass the accident off as an assassination attempt on the life of Adams Oshiomhole, but contrary to their claims, such suspicious accidents are not new to Adams Oshiomhole. “In today’s Nigeria, where we know how far people can go for money and power, perhaps Oshiomhole should come out and explain these suspicious deaths around him. “In view of the above facts, we hereby restate our call to the police and other relevant security agencies to immediately begin an investigation into these incessant crashes involving the convoy of Adams Oshiomhole, so that we can save more of our people from dying in his convoy.

Oshoke said, “It is rather unfortunate that people can reason in such a way. Accidents as the name implies cannot be deliberate, accidents happen every day and people die. Oshiomhole occupies a prominent position in the society because of his history, hence the publicity anything concerning him generates.”
