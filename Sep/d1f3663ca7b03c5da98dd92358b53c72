Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan Operatives of the Department of State Service; Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps as well as officials of Nigeria Correctional Centre screened applicants to the Oyo State Security Network, codenamed Operation Amotekun, on Wednesday. The Chairman of Amotekun in the state, Col. Kunle Togun (retd.), said the security agencies were involved to weed out applicants with criminal records. Toogun said  about 2,000 would be recruited into the outfit in the ongoing exercise. Togun, who is a former Director, Directorate of Military Intelligence, said the operations of the security outfit would greatly reduce criminal activities especially in the rural areas. Toogun said, “ Recruitment into Amotekun started today (Wednesday) and applicants have been coming. We are screening them to know who they truly are. “We don’t want to recruit criminals into the outfit. That is why we are being painstaking on what we are doing. We don’t want to rush and make mistakes.” Copyright PUNCH.
