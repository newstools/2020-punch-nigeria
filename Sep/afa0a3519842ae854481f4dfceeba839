Joseph Olaoluwa Emirates Airlines has said it is working closely with the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria to lift the ban imposed on the airline’s flight operations by the Federal Government. According to a statement from the public relations firm for the carrier made available to our correspondent, the airline stated that it was committed to connecting its Abuja and Lagos customers to Dubai. The statement read, “Emirates remains committed to serving its two Nigerian points, Abuja and Lagos, to connect our customers to and through Dubai to Emirates’ global network, and meet the growing demand for air travel in and out of the country. “Emirates is working closely with the UAE and Nigerian authorities, and will communicate any updates to our customers. We look forward to continue serving our customers in Nigeria.” The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, had on September 18 via his official twitter handle, announced the ban of Emirates flights to Nigeria effective on Monday (today). The tweet read: “The PTF sub-committee met today with EU Ambassadors to discuss Lufthansa, Air France/KLM ban. The meeting progressed well. “Emirates Airlines’ situation was reviewed and they are consequently included in the list of those not approved, with effect from Monday, September 21, 2020.” The Federal Government had in August vowed to enforce the principle of reciprocity in granting permission to airlines to resume operations. Prior to the resumption of international flights in the country, the Federal Government had initially included Emirates Airlines as one of the 14 airlines allowed to operate in the country.
