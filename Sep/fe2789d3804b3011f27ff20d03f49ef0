Dele Ogunyemi, Warri The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation casual/support staff in the Refining & Petrochemical Company, Warri, Delta State have petitioned the National Assembly to accelerate hearing in their matter already pending before the House of Representatives for their integration into the core staff of NNPC. They are also seeking the enforcement of the National Assembly’s earlier resolution that none of them should be disengaged pending the determination of the matter. In the petition dated 28th August, 2020, signed on their behalf by their legal counsel, U. C. Oparaugo, Esq, the embattled casual staff applauded the House Committee on Public Petition for commencing hearing in the matter on July 28. They however raised an alarm that despite the National Assembly’s intervention ‘over 300 of the casual staff have been disengaged even as the matter is yet to be conclusively ended’. They said that while they were not in any way averse to peaceful and amicable final resolution of the matter, their main concern was that “up till the time of this letter, the NNPC has not made any effort to reach or call the said representatives for a meeting”. While calling for accelerated hearing of the issues at stake, the petitioners called on the National Assembly to give the House Committee ‘a definite time frame for a report on the progress of the matter so far’ Copyright PUNCH.
