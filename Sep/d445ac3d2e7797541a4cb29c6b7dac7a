Peter Dada, Akure The Peoples Democratic Party has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to caution Governor Rotimi Akeredolu for allegedly causing violence across the state. The main opposition party in the state also accused security agencies in the state of complicity. This was contained in an open letter addressed to the President which was signed by the state PDP Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kennedy Peretei, on Wednesday. The letter read in part, “We believe that there is complicity involving even the Inspector General of Police and some service chiefs. Anywhere Akeredolu goes to campaign, about five or six buses loaded with political thugs, wielding guns accompany him. Only on Tuesday, September 22, these thugs unleashed violence on the people during Akeredolu’s campaign in Idanre. “The story has been the same anywhere he goes, be it Akure or Ondo town. If care is not taken, there will be genocide in Ondo State.” However, the state APC Publicity Secretary, Mr. Alex Kalejaiye, denied the allegations. Kalejaiye said,. “The APC wishes to say that it has no reason whatsoever to engage in, or encourage thuggery. Violence and thuggery are not in the character of the ruling party. It is astonishing to hear the PDP accusing the ruling party of promoting a do-or-die approach to election, which is actually their second name. “The desperation of PDP leaders is responsible for the bulk of crises recorded so far in the state. The so-called ‘Akure Agenda’, because its candidate is from Akure, explains why the members from the capital have severally launched unprovoked attacks on our members.” the party would transform the fortunes of the region.” Copyright PUNCH.
