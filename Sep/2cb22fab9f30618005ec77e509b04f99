Ifeoluwa Oyerinde The Sokoto Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arraigned a banker, Ezeagbor Chijioke, and his accomplices, Anthony Nneji and Ibenegbu Francis, before Justice Muhammad Muhammad of the Sokoto State High Court on fraud. The defendants were arraigned on four counts bordering on conspiracy, forgery, and obtaining money by false pretences. The men were arrested after the EFCC received a complaint against them for alleged conspiracy to defraud one Olajide Misbahudeen of N1m. The victim alleged that the suspects asked him to invest in the Central Bank of Nigeria Treasury Bills, and then allegedly forged and issued him a fake certificate. The charges read in part, “That you, Ezeagbor Chijioke, while being the direct sales agent of First City Monument Bank Plc; Anthony Nneji and Ibenegbu Francis of the C.S Paper works Business Centre; on or about February 20, 2020, at Sokoto, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, with intent to defraud, falsely obtained the total sum of N1m from one Olajide Misbahudeen, under the guise of investing the money in the Central Bank of Nigeria Treasury Bills, which you knew to be false, thereby committing an offence contrary to Section 1(1)(a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act 2006, and punishable under Section 1(3) of the same Act.” The men pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, S. H. Sa’ad, urged the court to remand the defendants in prison. The defence counsel informed the court of a bail application for the men. Justice Muhammad adjourned the matter till September 24, 2020, for commencement of trial and remanded them in prison. Copyright PUNCH.
