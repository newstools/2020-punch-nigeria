John Alechenu, Abuja The National Campaign Council of the Peoples Democratic Party for the Edo State Governorship Election has described the disbursement of federal funds by the All Progressives Congress controlled federal government, under guise the Micro Enterprise Enhancement Scheme, a few days to the election, as an attempt to induce voters. National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan said this in a statement titled, ‘PDP Campaign Condemns APC’s Plot to Beguile Edo Citizens…Says Edo People Can’t Be Bought,” in Abuja, on Thursday. The PDP described the distribution of the fund as a despicable attempt to swindle the people of Edo state and violate their conscience ahead of the September 19 election. Ologbondiyan said “The desperate resort to such underhand measure has further exposed the fact that the APC has lost confidence in the ability of its degraded candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, to command any genuine vote on Saturday, such illicit and scandalous enterprise avails nothing, as the people of Edo state cannot be bought.” In response, the Chairman of the Edo APC Media Campaign Council, John Mayaki in a statement titled, ‘Wild allegations won’t save Obaseki, PDP, says Edo APC,’ in Benin on Thursday said, “Such wild panic, expressed as wild accusations, only reflected PDP’s wild trouble, over sure and crushing defeat.” Copyright PUNCH.
