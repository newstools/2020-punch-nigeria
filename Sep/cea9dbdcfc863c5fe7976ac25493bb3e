Tony Okafor, Awka There is tension within the ranks of the Anambra State chapter of the All Progressives Grand Alliance following a recent visit of top-ranking members of the party to businessman, Arthur Eze, in Abuja. It was learnt that the APGA chieftains paid a visit to the businessman while fully dressed in the APGA regalia. The situation had created anxiety in the state because of the existing rift between Governor Willie Obiano and the oil magnate. The APGA chieftains’ visit came barely a few days after the governor travelled to the United States. It was learnt that Chief Ben Obi led the delegation. Reacting to this development, the Anambra State Chairman of APGA, Norbert Obi, on Sunday said, “Governor Willie Obiano did not send any delegation to anybody and was not aware of such visit. “We, the Party leadership, didn’t know of such trip. Those who made the trip are on their own.” Copyright PUNCH.
