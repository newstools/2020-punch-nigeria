Toni Ufoh Former head coach of the Super Falcons, Eucharia Uche, has ruled out the possibility of the women’s national team and their male counterparts, the Super Eagles, receiving equal pay. On Thursday, Brazil became the fourth country after Australia, Norway and New Zealand to pay their men and women’s national teams the same amount, which sparked reactions in Nigeria, with many also advocating for equal pay for both teams. But Eucharia, who led the team to the African Women’s Cup of Nations victory in 2010 in South Africa, said as good as the initiative was, it was impossible in the country at the moment. “I don’t think it is possible for the Falcons to earn as much as what the Eagles get now,” Eucharia, who played for the women’s national team in the 1990s, told Saturday PUNCH. “During my time as a player for the national team, what we got as match bonuses was what the U-23 men’s team were given. When we complained to the then Secretary-General of the NFF, Alhaji Sani Toro, he made us understand that the Eagles would naturally earn more than the Falcons. Though for me as a person, it’s no problem. “This is my opinion, let everyone get what is due to them, but on a personal note, I don’t think we should be thinking about such things now. We have many other things to think of in the national team.” Copyright PUNCH.
