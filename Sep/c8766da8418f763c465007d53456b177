Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Members of the Movement for a Socialist Alternative, Abuja Branch, on Monday staged a protest at the headquarters of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to kick against the hike in electricity tariffs. The protesters displayed placards with inscriptions such as ‘We reject hike in electricity tariffs’ and ‘NLC, TUC call mass protest against tariff hike’, among others. Dimeji Macaulay, a member of the MSA in Abuja, who led the protesters, said the reason for the protest was to reject the anti-poor policies of the government. He said, “Increment in electricity tariff is another attack that will not go unchallenged. The privatisation of the power sector has failed.” He accused NERC as being responsible for the hike of the tariffs by power distribution companies. Macauley said, “The commission must stop supporting distribution companies and we call for immediate reversal of the tariff hike.” The NERC had explained that not all power users were affected by the tariff hike after it approved an increase in electricity tariff with effect from September 1in a surprise move that caught many stakeholders unawares. The increase came three months after the tariff hike implementation slated for July 1 was halted by the National Assembly. The National Assembly had prevailed on the distribution companies to shelve the date to the first quarter of 2021 due to the current economic challenges in Nigeria. But the NERC stated that electricity customers, except those receiving less than 12 hours of supply, would have to pay more for electricity from September 1. It explained that the new tariff was based on the hours of electricity supply available to the customers. Copyright PUNCH.
