The Presiding Judge, Khadi Aliyu Muhammad Kani, had given the judgment after finding Yahaya Sharif-Aminu guilty as charged. Sharif-Aminu, a resident of Sharifai in Kano metropolis, was accused of committing blasphemy against the Prophet in a song he circulated via WhatsApp in March 2020. Ganduje told State House correspondents after a meeting with the President at the Presidential Villa, Abuja that he briefed Buhari on the development that has attracted criticism to the state. The governor said the house of the father of the accused was burnt by locals “but the boy was secured, charged to court and sentenced to death.” He said the boy had appealed the judgement. He however did not disclose the position of the President on the matter. Ganduje said his state has flattened the curve of COVID-19 despite the position of the Presidential Task Force. He said, “On COVID-19, I came to thank Mr. President for assisting Kano state with N5bn to fight the pandemic. That has assisted the state. We have opened five testing centers which are functional, the curve is now flattened.” The governor said he updated the on the security situation in the state, especially the military training facility his government has set up at the Falgore Forest for over N500m.
