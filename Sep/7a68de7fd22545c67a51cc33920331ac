Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt Electricity workers on Tuesday shut the headquarters of the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company in Port Harcourt, Rivers State to protest against workers’ poor welfare. The workers said the electricity distribution company had refused to sign the workers condition of service and procedural agreement and were also insensitive to workers’ welfare, among other infractions. The General Secretary, National Union of Electricity Employees, Joseph Ajaero, said, “All the electricity companies in the country have signed conditions of service except Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company. “You don’t work in a place without condition of service; that is where the rules of engagement and procedures are stated for the workplace. There must be industrial democracy in the workplace. “We started our protest at midnight today and we’ll be here till further notice and if we leave here and these issues are not resolved, we will take a solidarity action nationwide.” When contacted, the Public Relations Officer, Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company, Chioma Aminwe, said the issues raised by the workers were being addressed.
