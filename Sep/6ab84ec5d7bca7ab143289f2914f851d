Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly, Francis Okiye, and nine members of the assembly have congratulated Governor Godwin Obaseki on his re-election. The assembly members, who visited the governor at the Government House, Benin City, on Monday, included Emmanuel Agbaje, Yekini Idiaye and Nosa Okunbor, who are members of the All Progressives Congress. The Speaker said, “I am in the Government House with the other nine members inaugurated to congratulate Governor Godwin Obaseki on his victory in the just-concluded governorship election in the state. “Members of the state Assembly rejoice and congratulate the governor on his re-election as the Assembly remains united. We are here as one indivisible and united family. You can see that 10 of us were inaugurated and we are all here to congratulate the governor.” The Majority Leader, Henry Okhuarobo, maintained that there was no faction in the Assembly as the legislators remained one. “As we speak, we are back to the Assembly and we remain one. The issue of faction is not there as we remain one house. We have seven members of the PDP in the house, while three members are of the APC,” he stated. Copyright PUNCH.
