Peter Dada, Akure The oil-producing communities in the Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State have dragged the Ondo State Oil Producing Area Development Commission before the state high court over alleged failure of the commission to remit 40 per cent of the 13 per cent oil derivation funds accruable to the commission’s account. Other defendants in the suit include Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, the Ondo State Government and the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice. The claimants, through their counsel, Mr Olona Eniola and Mr Jerry Okuntade, stated that OSOPADEC, which was saddled with the responsibility of initiating developmental projects in the region, had failed to live up to the expectations of the people. They argued that the 40 per cent of the 13 per cent oil derivation funds accrued to the state should have been paid to OSOPADEC as a first-line charge. The claimants sought an order of the court to compel the first to fourth defendants “jointly or severally, to make full public disclosure to the oil-producing communities of Ilaje LGA all the money amounting to 40 per cent of the 13 per cent derivation fund accruable to Ondo State to be applied by the fourth defendant for the benefit of the claimants’ communities from the Federation Account from January 2001 when the commission’s law was enacted till date.” They also prayed the court to restrain “the first to third defendants from tempering with, diverting and howsoever expanding the 40 per cent of the 13 per cent derivation fund accruable to Ondo State to be applied by the fourth defendant from the federation account, except in accordance with the provision of the Ondo State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission Law Cap 106 Laws of Ondo State” The court has fixed September 16, 2020 for hearing.
