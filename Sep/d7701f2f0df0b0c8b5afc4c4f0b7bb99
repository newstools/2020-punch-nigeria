Peter Dada, Akure Twenty-five days to the October 10 Ondo State governorship election, Deputy Governor of the State, who is also the candidate of the Zenith Labour Party, Mr. Agboola Ajayi on Tuesday accused governor Rotimi Akeredolu SAN of frustrating his campaign. Ajayi accused the governor of refusing to approve a venue for the flag off of his campaign in Akure, the state capital. In a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media , Mr. Allen Sowore, Agboola described the governor’s action as undemocratic. He said “The Zenith Labour Party applied for the usage of the M.K.O Abiola Democracy Park, Akure to flag off its campaign rally. After the successful completion of all due process, the agency responsible, acting on the instruction of Ondo State governor deliberately hiked the price from the original  N5million, which the venue was given out to the PDP for its own rally on Saturday, 12th September,2020. “Even at that, the  ZLP was ready to pay the  N11 million charged  but the official in charge disappeared. It then became clear that Governor Akeredolu was ready to frustrate the ZLP. This is a condemnable act. However, the state Commissioner for Information, Mr. Donald Ojogo dismissed the claims. Ojogo said “The futile attempt to drag the Ondo State Government into the arena of frustrations suffered by the ZLP is most unacceptable. It must be noted that the venue in question is not under the control of the state government. It has long been firmed out to a consultant who manages the facility.” Copyright PUNCH.
