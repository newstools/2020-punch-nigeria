Afeez Hanafi The last two years have been harrowing for Hauwa Hassan to bear. Having lost her parents at a tender age, fate began to unfold its dark side before the 11-year-old girl. At a time she needs parental care to explore the world, all she could lean on is her ageing, poor grandmother. Her situation became worse two years ago when lumps started growing on her right leg and face, extending to the eye region. She was admitted to the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital in Kano State for treatment but it was stopped because of her grandmother’s inability to pay the medical bills. With the intervention of an aid group, Northwest Charity Foundation, a debt of N150,000 incurred at the hospital was cleared, Sunday PUNCH learnt. The founder of the charity organisation, Rukayya Shuaibu, told our correspondent on Saturday that Hassan had left the hospital to avert another outstanding payment. She said, “We are seeking help for three children in an emergency and Hauwa (Hassan) is one of them. Her case is pathetic. She is an orphan and has cancer on her eye and leg. She is an 11-year-old from Karaye Local Government Area of Kano. “She was on admission at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital but she left the hospital because there is no money to do the surgery. The family is poor and can’t afford the chemotherapy either. She stays with her grandmother. “Her hospital bill was almost N150,000 which our foundation raised money to pay. She needs about N270, 000 for the surgery and chemotherapy.” Shuaibu urged members of the public to help Hassan by making donations to the foundation’s  Paycom, 8131800502 Northwest Charity Foundation or her Sterling Bank account: 0077852527 with the name Yakubu Shuaibu Rukayya.
