Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The air component of Operation Hadarin Daji has eliminated several bandits and destroyed their logistics facilities during airstrikes conducted in the Kwiambana Forest area of Zamfara State. This was achieved on Tuesday by air interdiction missions executed under the subsidiary Operation Wutan Daji 2 meant to rid the North-West zone of criminal elements. A statement in Abuja on Wednesday by the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj. Gen. John Enenche, said the location was targeted after human intelligence reports and confirmatory Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance missions established that the cluster of huts and other structures at the edge of the forest served as a hideout for notorious bandits’ leaders, Sani Mochoko and Damina and some of their fighters. “Accordingly, the air component scrambled Nigerian Air Force jets and helicopter gunships to attack the location. The attack aircraft took turns in engaging the target area resulting in significant damage to the bandits’ structures as well as the killing of several of their fighters,” the statement disclosed.
