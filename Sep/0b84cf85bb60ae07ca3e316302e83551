John Alechenu, Abuja The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus and the party’s Deputy National Chairman (North), Sen. Suleiman Nazif, on Thursday, lead a high-powered delegation to the National Headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission to demand for credible polls in Edo and Ondo states. Secondus told the National Commissioner in charge of Election Observation and Party Monitoring, Prof. Anthonia Okoosi-Simbine, who received the delegation on behalf of the INEC Chairman, “We are deeply worried and in pain because of our past experiences, especially those of Kogi and Bayelsa. “We are worried because the country is in crises, crises in economy, crises in the area of security, virtually in all facets of the life of the nation and the only way out of all these crises is to conduct free and fair elections which will at most reduce the tension in our country today.” Speaking in a similar vein, Nasif said “We have had a lot of assurances but at the same time, it is one thing to assure us and it is another thing for us to go and hear that something else is happening. So, we don’t know what you are going to tell us today. Responding, Prof. Anthonia Okoosi-Simbine promised on behalf of INEC, to ensure a credible process. Copyright PUNCH.
