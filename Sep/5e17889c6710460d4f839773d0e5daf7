Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ended speculation over his Arsenal future on Tuesday as the Gunners captain signed a new three-year contract with the FA Cup holders. Aubameyang’s contract saga had dragged on since last season amid speculation he wanted to join a club in the Champions League. Gabon forward revealed he had committed his future to Arsenal in a live Instagram stream at the Emirates Stadium. “Arsenal fans, finally as you know I just signed the thing,” Aubameyang said. Arsenal confirmed the news themselves on their website in a statement that said: “Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has signed a new three-year contract with us!” (AFP)
