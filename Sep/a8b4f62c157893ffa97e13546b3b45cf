John Charles Makurdi Primary and secondary schools, as well as tertiary institutions in Benue State will resume on Monday, September 21, 2020. The state Commissioner for Education, Prof. Dennis Ityavyar, announced this on Wednesday  in Makurdi. According to the commissioner, public and private primary, secondary and tertiary institutions are to abide by the directives of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control on COVID-19. Ityavtyar explained that the resumption was for first term of 2020 and 2021 academic session, stressing that third term for other categories of pupils and students except JSS 3 and SSS 3 had been cancelled including payment of school fees. He said, “Let me emphasise on the issue of school fees so there is no confusion because if third term is cancelled, school fees for the term is also cancelled. “But in the case of JSS 3 and SSS 3, parents are expected to pay their third term fees. However, those who have not done third term, they don’t need to pay fees and this applies to private and public schools.” The commissioner stated that schools with high population would have to operate morning and afternoon sessions to avoid congestion.
