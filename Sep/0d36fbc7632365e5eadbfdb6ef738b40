Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State office of the Independent National Electoral Commission has said it is assessing its level of preparedness to deliver a credible and fair governorship election. Speaking at the Red Zone Implementer’ workshop held in collaboration with European Centre for Electoral Support, the state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr Johnson Alalibo, said the appraisal would give INEC the accurate assessment of what had been achieved with 16 days to the election. He stated, “It is good we are taking stock of what we have done so far, because that is the only way we can assess how far we have gone as we hope to deliver a hitch-free election. “We want to know the areas we have covered in the preparation for the September 19 governorship election and put more efforts in the areas we are lagging behind,” He also said that INEC had organised capacity building workshops for electoral officers across the 18 local government areas of the state towards achieving a credible governorship election in the state. The ECES Senior Project Officer, Sylvester Somo, said the workshop would enhance the operational and logistics efficiency of the commission towards the conduct of the election. Copyright PUNCH.
