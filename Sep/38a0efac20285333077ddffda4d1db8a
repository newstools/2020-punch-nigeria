Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Progressive Ambassadors of Nigeria, a civil society organisation, on Monday called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to consider the immediate evacuation of stranded Nigerian traders in Ghana. PAN said the appeal had become increasingly necessary following the rising cases of frustration, hunger and impoverishment, feelings of abandonment and conflicting reports of attempted suicides by several victims. It stated that the President should use the opportunity of celebrating Nigeria’s 60th independence to urgently evacuate Nigerian victims whose businesses were shut by the Ghanaian authorities. In a statement issued in Abuja and signed by the group’s National Director, Media, Emmanuel Ohiomokhare, PAN said the President should “consider the immediate evacuation of frustrated and stranded Nigerian traders in Ghana whose businesses were recently clamped down by the host government.” The CSO said its findings showed that some of the victims were currently being threatened by their landlords, having lost their means of livelihood. “As we speak, several families are now begging to feed with no form of palliatives or financial assistance and sick children are unable to access medical treatment,” PAN stated. It added, “The Progressive Ambassadors of Nigeria is greatly disturbed by this development which has the potential for unlawful resorts to either self-help or recourse to unpatriotic lifestyles capable of tarnishing the good image of our country.” Copyright PUNCH.
