Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has said the opposition parties and those who thought the state would have been plunged into crisis due to the labour protest which was on Tuesday suspended were disappointed. Wike stated this while answering questions from journalists after inspecting the Rebisi, GRA, Rumuola and Rumuogba flyover projects and ongoing road construction work in Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor Local Government Areas of the State. Wike expressed satisfaction that all contending issues with the organised labour were amicably resolved during Tuesday’s meeting at the Government House, Port Harcourt. “All the issues were mere misunderstandings and now that they have understood our position, they said they have to suspend the protest. “So for me, I am happy that there was nothing like conflict at the end of the day. Those of them who were thinking that Rivers State will be shut down were highly disappointed,” he added. The governor said he will not disappoint Rivers people, noting that through passion and commitment he has judiciously utilized scarce resources for the development of the State. He also stated that he is proud to be contributing his quota to the development of the state, saying, “It is not the ‘amount’ of resources you get that determines the kind of projects you carry out for your people. “It is your commitment, your passion for the development of your people. If you have very good resources and you don’t have the passion and commitment, resources cannot be utilized for the good of the people,” Wike stated. Wike expressed happiness with the pace of work at the various flyovers, saying the Rebisi flyover would be completed by December, while the Rumuogba and Okoro-Nu-Odo flyovers would be completed by February 2021.
