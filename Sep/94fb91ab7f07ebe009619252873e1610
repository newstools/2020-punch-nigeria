Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Senate Committee on the Review of 1999 Constitution has said it was not under pressure from external forces. The chairman of the panel, who is also the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, said this in a statement by his media aide, Yomi Odunuga, on Sunday. Omo-Agege, according to the statement, assured Nigerians that the panel would not kill any of the constitution alteration bills before it. He promised that the Senate would recommend all the bills before it for consideration. The committee had last week shifted the deadline for submission of memoranda from September 11 to September 25. He said, “Any Nigerian who feels strongly about any issue that ought to be addressed in this exercise has a right within the time stipulated to put their thoughts in writing by way of a memo and submit same to us. “Upon receipt of that, we will meet as a committee, set up some sub-committees within the main committee that will go to each of the geopolitical zones. “There they will reach out and ask people to step forward and speak to the memo that they have already submitted to us. “Thereafter, we will come back, hold a retreat where we will aggregate the views of the content of the memoranda. “Members of this committee and indeed all of the senators of this 9th Senate will do the right thing. We are not going to succumb to any pressure.” Copyright PUNCH.
