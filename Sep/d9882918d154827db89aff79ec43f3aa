Peter Dada, Akure The Deputy Governor of Ondo State, who is also the governorship candidate of Zenith Labour Party in the October 10, election, Mr Agboola Ajayi, has said he has no alliance with his Peoples Democratic Party opponent, Mr Eyitayo Jegede. The Chief Press Secretary to the deputy governor, Mr. Babatope Okeowo, while dismissing a report linking his principal to the PDP candidate, in an interview in Akure on Thursday, said the report was the handiwork of political rivals. Okeowo said “Let it be known to the members of the public that there is no romance between the candidate of ZLP and that of PDP. There was no offer and rejection of running mate from the PDP leadership or Jegede to Ajayi.” Copyright PUNCH.
