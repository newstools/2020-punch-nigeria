Nigerian Breweries Plc on Friday said its recent multi-million naira project of illuminating the Niger Bridge in the South-East region represents the progressive spirit of the Igbo people and offers them a ray of hope, especially at these trying economic times. It stated that the Light Up project carried out by one of the lager beer brands, Life, was borne out of the need to establish a closer bond with its core consumers in the region and enhance its brand identifier, which the iconic bridge represents. The company’s Head, Media, Digital, Brand PR and Sponsorship, Mr Wasiu Ola Abiola, in a statement titled, ‘Why we embarked on Niger Bridge Light Up initiative – NB Plc’s Life,’ and made available to Sunday PUNCH described the project as  a result of the brand’s sentimental attachment to the South-East. Abiola said the Life brand started as a regional beer when it was first brewed in Onitsha, Anambra State, in 1981, before growing to become “a popular choice of Nigerians in every part of the country”. While describing the initiative as “a historic landmark”, Abiola stated that the lighting up of the bridge was not only significant for the company and the Life lager beer brand but also the people of the South-East, due to the long-standing relationship existing between the brand and the people of the  region. Abiola stated that the Life lager brand had established a long-standing heritage of progress,  which had over the years seen it launch various initiatives that embodied and inspired progress through its communication in that part of the country. He added that the project, which spanned almost two years, was a way of enhancing the status of the iconic bridge, which had been displaying the Life brand’s messages since 2012. Also speaking, the Portfolio Manager, Mainstream Lager Brands, NB Plc, Omotunde Adenusi, said the significance of the initiative could be seen in the huge symbolism of the Niger Bridge to the people of the South-East.
