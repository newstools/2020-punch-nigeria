Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State Women Leader of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mrs Lindsay Sorae, has commended women in the state for coming out in a large number to vote for Governor Godwin Obaseki during Saturday’s election. She said by their action, they proved that they were politically conscious and responsible. Eghe said, “I am happy with the role the women played on Saturday. They all came out to support the governor. He has been very good to women by making sure they get 40 per cent of appointments in the state.” She also said that by creating a women’s wing for the Obaseki re-election campaign committee, which was headed by the Governor’s wife, Besty, the governor demonstrated his faith in the capacity of the women to deliver. She said, “There is an adage in Benin that whosoever a woman backs cannot fail, and that is what happened on Saturday. Our hope is that he will continue to give women more positions in his government and continue the good jobs he is doing.” Also, another woman, Mrs Elizabeth , said, “Victory was achieved because a lot of people came out to vote because of Obaseki. “We had so many first-time voters who want him to get re-elected. We all want him to come back and finish all that he started.” On her expectations, Omoruyi said the governor must complete all the projects he started; pensioners who have been screened should be paid their gratuity, as well as crashing the prices of goods and make it affordable for the masses.
