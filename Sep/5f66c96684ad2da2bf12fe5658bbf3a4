’Tosin Oluwalowo Napoli winger Matteo Politano says Victor Osimhen has great prospects, but would time to settle in after sealing an €81m move from Ligue 1 side Lille. The Eagles striker hit the ground running, scoring a hat-trick on his debut in Napoli’s 11-0 friendly win over L’Aquila on Friday. “Osimhen has great prospects, he’s a good guy and has to work calmly,” Politano told Sky Sport Italia. “You shouldn’t expect everything immediately; he comes from a championship that is different from the Italian one. “He has potential; it’s up to him to put it into action. We are happy to have him on the team and we will give him a hand. He has great ability. We should put him at ease.”
