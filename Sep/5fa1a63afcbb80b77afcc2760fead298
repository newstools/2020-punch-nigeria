Peter Dada, Akure The Senate of the University of Medical Sciences, Ondo, Ondo State has approved the establishment of a Faculty of Medical Rehabilitation in the university. The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Adesegun Fatusi, said the development was in line with the university’s vision to be a ‘one-stop’ institution for human resources development across all health and medical disciplines. He said, “The philosophy of the Faculty of Medical Rehabilitation is to produce university graduates of physiotherapy, occupational therapy, audiology, speech therapy, prosthetics/orthotics and other professionals in the field of rehabilitation who will satisfy the regional and national needs in these fields of health sciences.” The VC noted that his vision was to make UNIMED the leading institution in medical rehabilitation in West Africa to address the huge deficit in human resources for quality medical rehabilitation in Nigeria and the West Africa sub-region. “In the over seven decades history of university education in Nigeria, it is troubling that less than a dozen universities offer any course in medical rehabilitation and no university offers more than two courses in that field despite the huge and increasing need for medical rehabilitation services. “The UNIMED is out to change the narratives as we are set to offer new courses in occupational therapy, audiology, speech therapy, prosthetics and orthotics,” Fatusi said.
