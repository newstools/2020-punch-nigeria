Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State on Thursday disclosed the plan by his state and the Lagos State Government to take over the Lagos-Abeokuta Road from the Federal Government. He said the plan was to jointly rehabilitate and then commercialise the road. Abiodun disclosed this to State House correspondents after a meeting he had with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He said,  “The Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta Road is probably the second busiest road in this country. “Roads are in such deplorable condition and we understand that the Federal Government cannot afford to build all the roads at the same time. “But as a state government, Lagos State government and I have written to Mr President, asking Mr President to transfer that road to us. “It is a commercial road and we will commercialise it so that we can take that burden off the Federal Government. “I am glad to say that Mr President was very pleased with these our discussions and these applications and has promised to see what he will do to give us the necessary support so that this can also help us in the economic uplift of our region.” Abiodun said the state also requested the  rehabilitation of the Agbara-Lusada-Atan Road, which he described as the only link to Nigeria’s biggest industrial hub, the Agbara Industrial Estate. He noted the situation with the Agbara-Atan road was threatening Nigeria’s industrial growth. Copyright PUNCH.
