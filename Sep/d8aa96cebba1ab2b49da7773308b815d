Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Federal Government has declared Thursday, October 1, as a public holiday in commemoration of the nation’s 60th independence anniversary celebration. The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, who made the declaration on behalf of the Federal Government, congratulated Nigerians on the celebration of the country’s Diamond Jubilee. The declaration was contained in a statement on Tuesday, by the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mrs Georgina Ehuriah. It quoted Aregbesola as saying, “Our warmth, welcoming spirit and love as well as the abundant wealth inherent in our human capital and the richness of our land, make Nigeria unarguably the leading black nation in the world and Africa’s pride and beacon of hope if we can rally ourselves together to harness our potentials.” The minister explained that the 60th anniversary called for a celebration, but the COVID-19 pandemic foreclosed this. While wishing Nigerians a fruitful independence celebration, the minister reminded them that the nation’s founding fathers, in spite of the differences in faith, tribe and tongue, came together for Nigeria’s independence.
