Peter Dada, Akure The African Democratic Congress has said there was a need to investigate the fire outbreak which occurred on the premises of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Akure, the Ondo State capital. The PUNCH had earlier reported that INEC said the fire destroyed some 5,000 card readers meant to be used for the forthcoming October 10 governorship election in the state. Reacting in a statement issued by its Publicity Secretary, Eniola Olurotimi, ADC expressed shock over the incident, insisting that INEC must ensure the provision of another card readers. The statement partly read, “It was reported that the fire outbreak led to the destruction of smart card readers. The ADC as a party considers this very dramatic and an act of arson. The ADC as a party condemns in all ramifications this barbaric act that is likely coming from the ruling party with the sole purpose of destabilising the process of a free, fair and credible governorship election.
