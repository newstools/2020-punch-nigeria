Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan the crisis of confidence among leaders of the Oyo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress appears far from over. This follows concerns being raised by party members under the aegis of the Unity Forum who have continued to question the leadership of former Governor Adebayo Alao-Akala. Alao-Akala recently held a reconciliatory meeting at his Ibadan residence which some APC leaders attended. Another meeting was also held in Abuja before Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, held another meeting with Oyo APC leaders at his Ibadan residence last Sunday. Alao-Akala, who was appointed the Chairman of the APC Elders’ Advisory Council in Oyo State, at the meeting in a letter dated September 21 and addressed to APC leaders, had urged all members of the party to settle their differences and join him to restore peace in the APC. However, the Unity Forum on Tuesday in a statement signed by Senators Soji Akanbi, Olufemi Lanlehin, Ayoade Adeseun and Alhaji Adebayo Shittu, said Alao-Akala was never elected the APC leader in the state. Alao-Akala’s letter read in part, “I implore all members with aspiration to keep their ambitions for now and join me and others in building a virile and strong party. I am always available and open to everyone. “I hereby put all members on notice that an expanded, all-inclusive meeting shall be held soon to further cement our oneness. I reassure you that I am committed to leading our party to victory come 2023.” The Unity Forum said efforts to elect representatives at the meeting were resisted because party stakeholders were not equally represented at the meeting.
