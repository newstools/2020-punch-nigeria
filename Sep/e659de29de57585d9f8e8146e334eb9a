Grace Edema A Diaspora Yoruba coalition, Yoruba One Voice, has condemned the decision of the Federal Government to build a rail from Kano State to Niger Republic. The coalition added disregard for the law was responsible for Nigeria’s negative image globally. The coalition, in a statement by its Communications Director, Zacheaus Somorin, said, “Ideologically, YOV is not in support of a country that is seeking loan to develop another country – Niger Republic to be specific; with a rail network; we are not in support of a country that finds it palpably impossible to provide adequate security, electricity, quality road, food security, job security, affordable housing scheme, quality education, good public health sector. “Nigeria is a country that doesn’t believe in the rule of law, hence fated to have a negative image globally.” The coalition, however, alleged a ploy by an unnamed popular Lagos-based politician to disrupt the peaceful protest on October 1 by planting among them 500 hoodlums, to hijack the exercise. “As a coalition, we are using this medium to advise the sponsor of this malevolent act to desist from such as any action that will derail the liberation of Yoruba nations would not be taken lightly,” he said.
