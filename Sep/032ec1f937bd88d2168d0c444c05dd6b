Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The leadership of the Judiciary Staff of Nigeria has said its members in Ebonyi State will continue their strike until their demands are met. JUSUN members in Ebonyi are demanding implementation of the Consolidated Judiciary Salary Structure and alleged the government of refusing to pay them their annual leave allowances and non-authorisation of their promotions since 2015. The National Vice President (South-East Zone) of JUSUN, Comrade Ifezue Mark, stated this during a telephone chat with our correspondent, on Monday. He said, “The refusal of the state government to hearken to the demand of the workers could not be understood because the demand is not peculiar to Ebonyi State judiciary. It’s also a misconception on the part of the state government to claim that judiciary workers are asking for a salary increase; the claim is most uncharitable. “The branch is not asking for too much. Judiciary workers in Ebonyi State are among the least paid judiciary workers across the 36 states. I beg to be contradicted on this. The state government has the capacity to address the demands of the workers but deliberately refused to show that capacity. “When they ignore us, as they are presently doing, we will continue to withdraw our services. I will say nothing further.” Efforts to get the Ebonyi State Government to comment on the matter proved abortive.
