Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri Scores of protesters on Tuesday blocked the secretariat of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Imo State over the outcome of the primary election of the All Progressives Congress for Imo North by-election slated for October 31. The APC had submitted the name of a former Commissioner for Agriculture, Frank Ibezim, to INEC as its candidate for the election. But a former senator, Ifeanyi Araraume, who represented the district for eight years between 1999 and 2007, is laying claim to the ticket. His supporters marched to INECâ€™s secretariat where they submitted a petition against the APC candidate. A spokesperson for the protesters, Raymond Aguguo, alleged that Ararume won the APC primary election. Aguguo alleged that the APC candidate was disqualified by the screening panel based on an alleged inconsistency in his academic credentials. The protesters who marched to the Government House in Owerri afterwards were, however, prevented from having access into the complex by policemen who formed a barricade. One of the supporters of the APC candidate, Obinwanne Onwuchuruba, urged Araraume and his supporters to support Ibezim. Copyright PUNCH.
