Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has alleged that members of the Peoples Democratic Party led by the Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, were arming youths in the Akoko-Edo Local Government Area to disrupt the governorship election in the state. The Chairman of the APC Media Campaign Council, John Mayaki, said in an interview in Benin, on Tuesday, that the party had “credible intelligence” that weapons had been bought and supplied and awaiting distribution to thugs tasked with disrupting the polls in APC strongholds. Mayaki also alleged that the plot was hatched at a security meeting coordinated by Shaibu and a former Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Kabiru Adjoto, and urged security agencies to rise to the occasion and nip the plot in the bud. In response, the Senior Special Assistant to the Deputy Governor on Media, Ben Atu said, “Oshiomhole already told us that ‘Ize-Iyamu lies effortlessly’. How can we engage a man that is born into lies in the media? The Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu, was a member of Edo State House of Assembly for eight years, he was never caught dealing in arms.” Copyright PUNCH.
