Tony Okafor, Awka The Zone 13 Police Headquarters in Ukpo, Anambra State, has arrested one Izuchukwu Nwabueze for allegedly defrauding an Anglican bishop and 10 others. It was gathered that Nwabueze, who recently renounced his Anglican knighthood, allegedly defrauded his victims to the tune of N15m on the pretext of using the funds to furnish the residence of the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Danmallam Mohammed, who was newly posted to the area. Others allegedly swindled by the 35-year-old Nwabueze, who is a relation of an oil mogul in the state, included an hotelier and other prominent Anambra people. A statement by the Zonal Police Public Relations Officer, Nkeiruka Nwode, said the suspect would soon be arraigned. She said the AIG had instructed those defrauded to report at the zonal headquarters at Ukpo and cautioned members of the public to be wary of the new fraud trends. She said, “The suspect has been posing as an aide to the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, the impersonation that gave him opportunity to defraud unsuspecting traders and rich people in Anambra State of their hard-earned money. “The suspect, who pretended to be raising funds for the furnishing of an unknown residential quarter and for the installation of a soundproof generator for the AIG Zone 13, Ukpo, cornered the victims to perpetuate the crime. “The suspect, Chief Izuchukwu Nwabueze, also obtained money under false pretences from many other prominent persons in the state. “The suspect also defrauded to the tune of N1m one Ifeanyi Umeh Lovelyn on behalf of an Anglican bishop, among others.” Nwode said the suspect was also issuing dud cheques to some of his victims, adding that he had  been charged.
