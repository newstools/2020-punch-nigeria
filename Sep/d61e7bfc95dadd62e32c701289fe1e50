Kayode Oyero The candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the 2020 Edo State Governorship Election, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has admitted that he lost the election. Ize-Iyamu agreed that the Peoples Democratic Party won the election and he has since congratulated the opposition party. The Independent National Electoral Commission on Sunday afternoon declared PDP’s candidate, Governor Godwin Obaseki, winner of the keenly contested election. INEC’s Returning Officer, Prof. Akpofure Rim-Rukeh, who announced the result of the election, said Obaseki polled 307,955 votes to defeat his closest rival, Ize-Iyamu, who got 223,619 votes. Rim-Ruke, while declaring Obaseki winner, said the incumbent governor was returned elected after satisfying all requirements in line with the law. Obaseki was elected on APC’s platform in 2016 but defected to the PDP after being denied the ticket owing to intra-party squabbles. Reacting via his Twitter handle, Ize-Iyamu wrote, “Edo people has decided, we thank you all! Congratulations to the opposition party! They have won! Election no be war. It’s time to work more harder for the next 4 years. Congratulations.” See tweet:
