Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria, in conjunction with the Light of Peace for Africa Foundation, on Wednesday said it had slated September, 16, 2020, for fasting and prayers for a peaceful election in the state. Chairman of the association, Bishop Oriname Kure, at a press briefing in Benin, stressed  the need for the leaders of parties and God-fearing people in the state to come together to seek the face of God to avoid bloodshed and violence before, during and after the election. “CAN hereby call on all churches, all pastors, all Christians, all God- fearing and all good people of Edo State for a one day prayer and fasting for peaceful election in Edo State. “The prayer service is very crucial and critical to the destiny of the state as we all in humility and reverently stand in prayers to call on God Almighty for divine intervention in His mercy and almightiness for peace like a river in Edo State before, during and after election”, Kure said. The  Christian leader further  said the September 19 governorship election was a very crucial moment in determining the destiny of the state “ bearing in mind the future of the state, the future of our children, our integrity, faith and for the sustainability of the developmental strides that have since placed the state in an enviable position in the comity of states of the Nigerian federation.’ Copyright PUNCH.
