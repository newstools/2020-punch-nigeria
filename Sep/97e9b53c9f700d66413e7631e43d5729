Samson Folarin Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Monday promised to fulfil all his campaign promises despite the disruption occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic and the reduction in the budget size. While stressing that there could be no excuse for non-performance, he said his administration was determined to improve governance through innovative and inclusive policies. Sanwo-Olu spoke during the opening ceremony of a two-day ministerial performance review retreat held at the Adeyemi Bero Auditorium, Alausa, Ikeja. He implored members of the state executive council and other public office holders to be committed to government’s efforts to meet the yearnings and aspirations of Lagosians. “Let me emphasis that our yardstick for performance assessment will not be based majorly on the amount of money expended or budget, but the outcome of our various interventions; what measures the impact that touched the lives of citizens that we swore to serve,” he added. The Deputy Governor, Dr Obafemi Hamzat, in his address, enumerated all the achievements of the administration in the last one year and four months, saying the government would keep faith with its THEMES agenda.
