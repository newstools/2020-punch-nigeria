Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin Kwara State Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, on Thursday said the state’s Stadium Sports Complex, Ilorin will be named after the late Rashidi Yekini, Nigeria’s all-time highest goalscorer. Abdulrazaq stated this during  a meeting with the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, in Abuja. The governor, at the meeting, according to a statement from the Media Office of the minister and made available to newsmen in Ilorin, also discussed prospects in youth and sports development. “We will send a bill to the State House of Assembly to immortalise Rashidi Yekini with the name of the stadium changing after the approval,” Abdulrazaq said. Yekini, who hailed from Ira in Oyun Local Government Area of Kwara State, died on May 2012 aged 48. He was top scorer with four goals as the Super Eagles claimed a second AFCON title in Tunisia in 1994. The former 3SC striker also scored the country’s first World Cup goal in the Eagles’ debut appearance at the Mundial in 1994. Meanwhile, Dare urged Abdulrazaq to sustain his support for sports development, noting that sports helped in reducing social vices. “I want to thank the governor for hosting our biggest youth games in Ilorin. We are coming to Ilorin again because of the facilities in University of Ilorin soonest for the youth games. I love the fact that Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq loves sports. I want to encourage him to invest more on sports,” he stated. Copyright PUNCH.
