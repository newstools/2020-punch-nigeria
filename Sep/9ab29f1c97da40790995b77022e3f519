National Union of Road Transport Workers has asked the Federal Government to reverse the current increment in the price of petrol and electricity. Kwara State Chairman of NURTW, Alhaji Abdulrazaq Ariwoola, while condemning the increase in fuel price on Friday, said it would cause hardship for the people. Ariwoola lamented that those in the transportation business had yet to get out of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, before the government added “insult to injury of transport workers by increasing the pump price of fuel.” He said that the government had previously assured the transport workers that it would reduce the fuel price, adding that the reverse is now the case. “Government should immediately reverse the price of fuel if it does not want the transport workers to jerk up the transport fare. If the government insists on going with this policy, we in the transport business will have no alternative but to increase the transport fare for the passengers,” he said. Also, the Executive Director, Community Outreach for Development and Welfare Advocacy, Mr Taiwo Otitolaye, said the hikes were condemnable, adding that the Federal Government was dancing to the dictate of the International Monetary Fund to deregulate the economy of Nigeria. He said, “The price increase in fuel and electricity is meant to cause hardship for ordinary Nigerians who are already impoverished. The price increase will affect everyone including those in the rural areas.”
