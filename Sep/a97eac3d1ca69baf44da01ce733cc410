Afeez Hanafi NASFAT Agency for Zakat and Sadaqat, an arm of the Nasrul-Lahi-l-Fatih Society, says it has empowered underprivileged people, especially those economically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with cash and working tools worth about N40m donated to the agency in 2020. NAZAS Chairman, Mr. Hafiz Bakare, who disclosed this on Friday during the Muharram Special Distribution of Empowerment Tools and Items at the Lagos State Secretariat Mosque Extension, Alausa, said the disbursement also included scholarships to students and relief funds for people with health challenges. He described the agency as a credible platform for collection, distribution, administration and management of charity channelled towards members of the Muslim faith, as well as non-Muslims. Bakare said, “Over the last six years, we have collected over N300m and disbursement is done in our various zones, including what is happening here today. Over 35,000 indigents have benefited, including about 1,000 direct beneficiaries through both Ramadan and Muharram public disbursements, as well as the newly introduced Eid-ul Maolud public disbursement and other routine and emergency disbursements.” NASFAT Women Affairs Secretary, Alhaji Suweebah Kupolati, who represented the society’s President, Alhaji Niyi Yusuf, appreciated the donors and urged the beneficiaries to make good use of the empowerment.
