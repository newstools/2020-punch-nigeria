Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State Governor and the Peoples Democratic candidate in Saturday’s election in Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission to deploy the drones for the polls. Obaseki who was at the venue of the INEC stakeholders meeting in Benin stated that the use of drone would make it easy for INEC to monitor the elections instead of only relying on human efforts. He also expressed fear that the non-usage of the Z-pad might put the efficacy of the electoral process in doubt, while calling on INEC to restore the use of incidence form. “I must say that the use of drone will help INEC to monitor the election better. The Z-pad will not be used as INEC have said so I am hoping that the incidence form will be used this time,” Obaseki added. The INEC boss, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, stated that it was impossible to monitor all the polling units with drones as it wasn’t cost effective due to the fact that most of the drones might not be recovered at the end of the election. The INEC boss also said that the use of the incidence form stopped in 2019 and that there was no plan to bring it back. “We have resolved to hold a free, fair and credible election and everything has been deployed to ensure that the election goes on without hiccups,” he added.
