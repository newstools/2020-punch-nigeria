Adelani Adepegba,Abuja The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on Wednesday met with ambassadors from countries with high records of the coronavirus. The meeting which was held in Abuja, was part of the preparation for the reopening of the country’s airspace for international flights scheduled for Saturday. The airspace had been shut to international flight since March 2020 following the global lockdown as part of the measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting with the ambassadors was announced by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, on his Twitter handle. Onyeama said he met with the ambassadors in the company of the National Coordinator, Dr Sani Aliyu. “Met with the National Coordinator, #PTFCOVID19, Dr Sani Aliyu and Ambassadors of Countries with high rates of discordant #COVID19 test results,” he tweeted. The meeting was meant to inform the envoys about the country’s new travel protocols. The FG had earlier announced that it would apply the policy of reciprocity when the airspace is opened following the travel ban on Nigeria by some western countries in the aftermath of the COVID-19.
