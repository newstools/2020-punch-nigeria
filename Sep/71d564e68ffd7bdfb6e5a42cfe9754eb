Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Nigerian Communications Commission has warned against the illegal use of GSM boosters by individuals across the country. GSM boosters are devices that transmit and receive telecommunications signals and can interfere with other radio frequency equipment. In a notice on its website, the commission said individuals desirous of using GSM boosters should note that they could only do so in conjunction with licensed network operators. In the notice, which was signed by the agency’s Director of Public Affairs, Ikechukwu Adinde, the commission said, “The attention of the NCC has been drawn to the fact that GSM boosters are being illegally used by individuals in Nigeria. “Members of the public should note that wilful interference with any wireless telegraphy is an offence under Section 16 of the Telegraphy Act, 2004. The commission will not condone any flagrant breach on this law.” It said monitoring mechanisms had been put in place and anyone caught using GSM booster without obtaining approval of a duly licensed network operator would face arrest and prosecution. The NCC said any member of the public with useful information regarding the illegal use of GSM boosters should contact the commission.
