Abiodun Nejo, Ado-Ekiti The Corps Commander, Ekiti State Security Network, otherwise known as Amotekun Corps, Brig. Gen Joe Komolafe, said on Wednesday that training for successful candidates for the outfit would begin on Sunday. Komolafe said the 325 successful candidates shortlisted out of the 3,261 applicants invited for the just concluded screening would participate in the three-week training beginning on Sunday at the Ekiti State University, Ifaki-Ekiti campus. The Amotekun commander said, “With the recruitment of the corps, the spate of insecurity will be reduced to the barest minimum. Criminal-minded elements should steer clear of Ekiti State or meet their Waterloo”. Komolafe urged the successful candidates to resume to camp within the stipulated period, warning that “there would be no further registration after the cut-off date of the midnight Wednesday, 30 September, 2020. “Only successful candidates whose name appears on the Amotekun website are to come to the training camp with two white T-shirts, two white shorts, two pairs of white canvas shoes, hand sanitizers, face masks, toiletries and other items,” he said. Komolafe said the exercise had been transparent with personnel from the Amotekun agency and certified security experts involved in the process. “The recruits will be posted to strategic places across the state to work in collaboration with conventional security agencies in keeping criminal activities at bay,” he said.
