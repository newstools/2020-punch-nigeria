Samson Folarin Owners of cinemas and practitioners in the creative industry, under the aegis of the Cinema Exhibitors Association of Nigeria, have asked the Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to reopen their business. The group, while promising to abide by the COVID-19 safety measures, said other states had reopened cinemas and Lagos should not be an exception. A statement said members of the association spoke during a virtual meeting with Sanwo-Olu on Wednesday. A representative of the group, Mr Moses Babatope, said at the meeting that the cinema owners were ready to reopen. “Cinemas outside Lagos are already open and they are complying with all the necessary protocols. We understand that your office is being careful about health and safety of Lagosians, but we also assure you that these are top considerations for us too,” he added. A film maker, Omoni Oboli, appealed to the governor for tax waivers, saying no one in the film industry earned a revenue in the past six months. Sanwo-Olu, in his response, said his administration was mindful of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on the entertainment industry, particularly the cinema sector. He promised to work with the group to achieve a win-win situation. Copyright PUNCH.
