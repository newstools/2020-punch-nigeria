The Eiffel Tower in Paris was evacuated for two hours Wednesday after an anonymous caller threatened to blow up the great edifice in the heart of the French capital, police said. After an inspection, nothing suspicious was found and the Eiffel Tower was able to reopen to visitors. “A man phoned up, shouted ‘Allah Akbar’ and said he was going to ‘blow up everything'” at the Eiffel Tower, said a police source, who asked not to be named. A security cordon was put around the monument, traffic diverted and the Eiffel Tower evacuated at 12:15 pm (1015 GMT).
