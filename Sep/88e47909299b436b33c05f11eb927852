Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government is committed to rehabilitating the aging infrastructure in Nigeria despite the prevalent recession globally, the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, said on Tuesday. Fashola said this in Abuja while inaugurating the 9th board of the Quantity Surveyors Registration Board of Nigeria. The minister said, “At this time of global recession and limited resources, when governments including ours are challenged to do more with less, your professional roles and skills will be in even greater demand.” Fashola charged the surveyors to support government’s efforts at driving infrastructural development across the country.
