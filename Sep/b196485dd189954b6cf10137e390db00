Dayo Ojerinde The Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, Lagos State chapter, has urged the Lagos State Government to reinstate the consultant cadre for pharmacists in the state. In a letter written to Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, dated September 25, the Lagos PSN Chairman, Mr Gbolagade Iyiola, said the executive council of the Lagos State Government approved the consultancy cadre for pharmacists in the public sector but has suspended the benefits package on the promptings of the Nigerian Medical Association. “This discourse of a freshly approved Consultant cadre for Pharmacists by the Federal Government becomes the ideal time to call on the Lagos State Government, Local Government Areas and Local Council Development Areas to entrench the consultant cadre earlier approved but suspended across board in Lagos State. “It is tragic that the immediate past administration sacrificed a well-thought-out agreement it had with a coalition of organised labour and the Lagos PSN to suit the NMA in matters that are ordinarily out of its jurisdiction. “There is a high incidence of politics in our health sector which has reduced our output in health care to a peculiar Nigerian type of health system as against international best practices,” the letter read in part.
