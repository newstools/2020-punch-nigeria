Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party in the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State, Natasha Akpoti, has said the visa ban on election riggers in Kogi State should be extended to principal officers of the Independent National Electoral Commission. She said that this is necessary because of the “ignoble roles” they played in the Kogi election. Akpoti made the call in a statement on Tuesday to react to the United States’ visa ban on individuals who undermined electoral processes in Nigeria. She applauded the US government for its decision to place a visa ban on individuals who rigged Kogi elections and others.
