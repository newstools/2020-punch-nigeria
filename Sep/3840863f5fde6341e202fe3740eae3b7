Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Chairman of Gokana Local Government Area of Rivers State, Paul Kobani, has been arrested by the police over an alleged criminal matter. There were widespread speculations on Friday that Kobani was arrested in connection with the late notorious armed robber and kidnapper, Honest Diigbara, otherwise called Bobisky, but the police only confirmed his arrest. Kobani’s arrest came barely 24 hours after the state Governor, Nyesom Wike redeemed his pledge of a N30m bounty placed on Bobisky’s head for anyone that could give useful information would led to his arrest. Kobani was reportedly picked up in his residence in handcuffs on Friday morning and taken into custody at an undisclosed police station in Port Harcourt. The state Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mukan, confirmed Kobani’s arrest to our correspondent, but said he matter was still under investigation. “I am yet to be furnished with the details. He’s just been taken into custody. Investigation is on. He has not been linked with Bobisky’s case,” Mukan stated, Giving more information on the council chairman’s arrest on Friday evening, the spokesman for the state police command, SP Nnamdi Omoni, was evasive but confirmed the arrest. He stated, “Gokana chairman was invited by the police in connection with a case we are investigating. So he is here (in custody) helping us to make some clarifications of which if he is not indicted or not found culpable, he will be left of the hook. “For now he is helping us in the case for which he is invited until the investigation is over. So any link with Bobisky is neither here nor there and we have not said so until the end of investigation. We will still come up with our position.” Copyright PUNCH.
