Ada Wodu, Calabar The Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Naval Command of the Nigerian Navy, Rear Admiral David Adeniran, has charged the Naval War College Nigeria Course 4 participants not to allow their personal interests override that of the nation while fighting against maritime criminality. Adeniran gave the charge during the Inter-Agency Cooperation in Maritime Security Operation Seminar, 2020, held in Calabar on Saturday. He said in spite of all the technologies required and provided in the fight against criminality within the nation’s waterways, national interest was necessary to succeed. Adeniran stated, “When personal interest supersedes national interest, the operation will fail and the personal interest will invariably fail, because it is always temporary. “When you get to your units after your training, look for other agencies and form a synergy as no one agency can ensure maritime security alone. “If we have improved maritime domain awareness, there will be reduced maritime crimes.
