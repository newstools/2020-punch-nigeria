Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is investigating the conduct of dominant pay TV service providers in Nigeria. It stated that in the past 24 months the commission had pursued legal action in court, secured an injunction pre-empting price rise and entered specific orders regarding a provider. The Director-General, FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera, said in a statement issued by the agency in Abuja on Tuesday that the commission had also engaged in periodic surveillance and monitoring. He said the FCCPC recently inquired into a purported tax increase by at least one provider. According to him, the investigations are done following concerns by the public regarding the services of pay TV providers. Irukera assured consumers of pay TV services that the commission would keep promoting initiatives to ensure fairness to citizens across the country. Copyright PUNCH.
