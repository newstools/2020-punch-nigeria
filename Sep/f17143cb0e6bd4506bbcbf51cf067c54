Friday Olokor, Abuja The National Association of Nigerian Students on Thursday said it was set to hit the streets except the Federal Government reversed the increase in the pump price of fuel and electricity tariff. The organisation threatened to embark on a nationwide protest on Monday September 14, 2020, if urgent steps were not taken to reverse the new prices. NANS President, Danielson Akpan, who made this known during a press briefing in Abuja, called on the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), to prioritise the welfare of Nigerians. Akpan said, “Nigerians are bewildered that having been under months of lockdown and restrictive measures, welcoming them back to normal life with increases in prices of essential commodities is a burden too harsh for the citizens to bear. “It is no longer news that the Federal Government in a swooping total deregulation and subsidy removal policy announced another increase in the pump price of PMS. It is also a known fact that prior to that, the Federal Government also approved increases in electricity tariff while banks regrettably reduced interests on customer savings.
