Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The successor National Development Plan 2020-2025 of the Federal Government has sufficient capacity to accelerate the attainment of various regional and global agendas, the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clem Agba, has said. Agba said the plan being developed by his ministry would enable Nigeria attain targets including the African Union 2063 agenda, the ECOWAS Integration Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals 2030. According to him, the plan will be implemented from January 2021 after the expiration of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan in December. The minister said this in a statement issued in Abuja on Sunday by his ministry’s Director of Information, Victoria Agba-Attah. The statement was titled ‘Successor development plan to accelerate attainment of AU Agenda 2063, SDGs 2030’. Agba had recently given a progress report on the activities of the Technical Working Groups on the development of the National Development Plan 2020-2025. The budget minister was quoted in the statement issued on Sunday as saying, “In line with this thinking, the TWGs are already incorporating and applying the concept of futurology in their work. “We expect that the final document will not only postulate possible and probable futures for the citizens of Nigeria, but also come up with measures for creation of the future we desire.” The minister explained that the government’s policies in the outgoing decade had been predicated on the Nigeria Vision 20:2020 being implemented through the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan 2017-2020.
