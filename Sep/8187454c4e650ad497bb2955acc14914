The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons in Kano State has arrested a 29-year-old housewife, Jamila Abubakar, over the alleged murder of her stepson, Mohammed Bashir. The NAPTIP Zonal Commander in charge of Kano, Shehu Umar, said the suspect was apprehended on Thursday, after she beat the seven-year-old boy to death at Tarouni market area of Kano metropolis. Umar recalled that the agency earlier invited the housewife over alleged child abuse after rescuing the deceased whom she confined to a room without food. He told the News Agency of Nigeria that NAPTIP provided shelter and medication to the victim before reuniting him with his father after the couple wrote an undertaking not to maltreat him again. Umar said, “Unfortunately, the victim was eventually beaten to death. The case has been transferred to the state police command for further investigation and prosecution.”
