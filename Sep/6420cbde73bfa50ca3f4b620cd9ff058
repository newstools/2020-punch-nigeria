Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Nigeria Labour Congress has vowed to proceed with its planned strike and protest with effect from September 28 following the failure of the Federal Government to reverse the hike in electricity tariff and fuel price. Rising from its National Executive Council meeting in Abuja a few minutes ago, the NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, said the proposed action by the organised labour would proceed from next week. He stated that the decision was unanimously taken by the chairmen of the 36 states and FCT chapters of the NLC.
