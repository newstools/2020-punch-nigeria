Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa THE Speaker of Bayelsa State House of Assembly, Mr. Abraham Ingobere, has denied insinuation in some quarters that he ran away with the mace to abort plans by Governor Douye Diri to have him impeached. In a statement, Ingobere said the rumour circulating on social media platforms that he escaped with the mace during plenary was baseless. He said the speculation was orchestrated “by jobless politicians whose stock in trade is to cause disaffection where there is cordiality.” Ingobere said the legislature under his leadership was enjoying a robust relationship with the executive arm of government.
