Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi Senator Isa Hamma Misau, another political supporter of former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party and rejoined the All Progressives Congress.

He said, “He (Misau) came alone into the PDP in 2019 when he was denied ticket to contest, he could not win even in his polling unit; if he is going, bye-bye to him”. Akuyam, who described the situation as very unfortunate, said, “You know he has a lot of issues hanging on his neck to settle with the federal government. “As he and others are going, many others are coming in to replace them. We are not afraid of anything come 2023. It is a river and when we get to the bank, we will create a bridge with which to cross the river.”
