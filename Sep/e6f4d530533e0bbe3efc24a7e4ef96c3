Joseph Olaoluwa APM Terminals Apapa has rolled out 4G LTE (Long-Term Evolution) networks at its facilities. The essence of this development is to enhance efficiency and productivity at West Africa’s largest container terminal, according to a statement emailed to our correspondent on Wednesday. The statement dated September 8, 2020 was titled ‘APM Terminals Apapa boosts efficiency with scalable 4G wireless network’. The 4G LTE is a standards-based network that uses radio equipment to service the terminals applications and the services and can be tailored to process a very high volume of data messages with minimal delay. The base station allows it to be independent of traffic peaks in the wider network. Copyright PUNCH.
