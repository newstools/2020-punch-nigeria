Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Thursday, said he was committed to a free and fair governorship election in Edo State. He, therefore, called on stakeholders in the election holding on Saturday to avoid what he called “do-or-die mentality”. Buhari’s position was contained in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled “Edo election: President Buhari urges parties, candidates, security agents to behave responsibly”. Shehu quoted Buhari as advising political parties, candidates, and security agents to behave responsibly in the election. He quoted the President as saying that, “I am passionately committed to free and fair elections, but my own commitment is not enough if other actors at ground zero refuse to abide by the rules. “I want to see democratic standards in the country raised higher at every level, but these cannot be achieved when politicians resort to do or die methods to gain power by any means or machination. “The do-or-die mentality to politics is a threat to free and fair elections because the actors are more focused on winning than caring about a fair outcome that reflects the Will of the people.” The presidential aide said Buhari appealed to all political parties and their candidates to behave peacefully and respect law and order. He also advised election officials and security agents “to remain neutral to ensure free and fair elections and avoid any action(s) capable of compromising the integrity of the elections.” Buhari stressed that “conducting free and fair elections is one of my main concerns for our democracy, and I want this commitment to be one of the legacies I will leave behind when I depart office.”
