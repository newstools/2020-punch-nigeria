Ted Odogwu, Kano The Kano State Police Command on Monday arraigned a fake lawyer, Dahiru Adamu, a resident of Kurna Quarters in the metropolitan city at a magistrate’s court for impersonation. The police prosecutor informed the court that the offence contravened Section 133 of the Penal Code Law. After reading the content of the First Information Report, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the offence. The prosecutor argued that the defendant was always clad in a lawyer’s attire, comprising wig and gown, with which he roamed the court premises, parading himself as a lawyer. He added that the defendant specialised in processing bail of accused persons in court. The magistrate ordered the remand of Adamu in the Kano Correctional and Rehabilitation Centre, and adjourned the matter till October 20, 2020.    ,, Copyright PUNCH.
