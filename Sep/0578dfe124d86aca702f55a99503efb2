Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti A National Assembly member, Senator Biodun Olujimi, has accused former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, of frustrating the efforts made by Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, to end the crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party in Ekiti State. Olujimi, who described Makinde as the party’s leader in the South-West geo-political zone, urged the governor to discountenance moves against him, but continue with his quest “to reposition, galvanise and salvage the party from the brinks of collapse”. Fayose had on Wednesday warned the governor not to meddle into political affairs in Ekiti State. But the senator representing Ekiti South Senatorial District, who spoke in Ado Ekiti at a meeting of her faction of the PDP, described Fayose, including his collaborators as ‘political jobbers’ and asked Makinde to ignore their threats.

So, anything that must come from the zone must come through him. Fayose and his conspirators’ visit to Uche Secondus was nothing but a recreational. I can take anybody to the National Secretariat of the party and we take pictures. “ We stand by Makinde because nobody can rubbish him and wish him away. This is the best time South-West Zone needs the governor most when ‘hijackers’ are trying to undermine the party’s structure through egregious conspiracy.”
