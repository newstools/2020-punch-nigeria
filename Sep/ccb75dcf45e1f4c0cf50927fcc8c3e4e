Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Gunmen struck along Ijan Ekiti-Ise Ekiti Road on Tuesday in Ijan Ekiti, in the Gbonyin Local Government Area of Ekiti State, killing one person and abducting two others, including a retired United States of America army officer, Major Jide Ijadare. This came less than two days after gunmen killed a director in the Ekiti State Local Government Commission, Mr David Jejelowo, in his house at Ado Ekiti. Sources said the gunmen invaded Ijadare’s palm oil producing factory along the road and shot dead one person and took away the retired major and another person whose identity could not be ascertained. One of the sources said, “On gaining access to the factory, the criminals started shooting. They killed one of the staff members. They thereafter dragged Major Ijadare and the other workers into the car and zoomed off.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Sunday Abutu, said, “A retired US soldier was kidnapped around 2pm today (Tuesday) and one other. “One person was also killed during the attack at a factory in Ijan Ekiti where the two persons were kidnapped. “The police commissioner, Tunde Mobayo, has sent policemen to the place. We will rescue the two persons.” Copyright PUNCH.
