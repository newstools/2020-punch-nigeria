The NLC and TUC subsequently declared strike and protest scheduled to commence from Tuesday. Both unions said they would collaborate to execute the industrial action for maximum effect. Rising from a meeting in Abuja on Tuesday, the National Executive Council of the NLC comprising the chairpersons of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory endorsed the decision earlier taken by the Central Working Committee of the Congress on the strike last Wednesday. The CWC had handed down a two-week ultimatum to the FG to reverse the price hike or face industrial action. The TUC had also mobilized its affiliate members to participate in the proposed civil disobedience.
