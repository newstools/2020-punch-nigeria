Joseph Olaoluwa Owing to the issues arising from uploading information on the Nigeria International Travel Portal, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority has advised foreign airline operators to allow intending passengers traveling to Nigeria board flights without any QR code. This was contained in a memo signed by the Director-General of the NCAA, Capt. Musa Nuhu, who noted that passengers seeking a return to Nigeria had encountered several difficulties accessing the platform. The memo titled ‘Online platform service difficulties” was dated September 8, 2020. The notice directed foreign airlines to temporarily withdraw from asking travelers to present evidence of payment receipt in the form of a QR code until additional work on the platform was completed. The statement read, “Following the partial resumption of international flights to Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos and Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja on Saturday, September 2020, we wish to inform the industry the following: “It has been brought to the notice of the authority difficulties several intending passengers to Nigeria are having with the use of the online platform for uploading information, making payments and printing QR codes required for travel to Nigeria. “Airlines are hereby notified that the presentation of evidence of payment receipt in the form of a QR code is recommended for all passengers but is not a mandatory requirement for boarding flights to Nigeria for now.” Copyright PUNCH.
