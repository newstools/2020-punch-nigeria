Sunday Aborisade, Abuja A factional leader of the All Progressives Congress in Zamfara State, Senator Kabir Marafa, has denied holding a secret meeting with the state Governor, Bello Matawalle in Abuja. Marafa, who represented Zamfara Central in the 8th Senate, attributed the said report to an alleged desperate plot by his main rival, the former governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari, to push him out of the APC The senator said this in a statement he issued on Sunday in Abuja titled, ‘Yari and his followers living in fear, delusion and desperation.’ He described the news of the said secret meeting with Metawalle at the state government’s lodge in Abuja, as wicked and callous. Marafa challenged anybody with proof of the said meeting and interview clips with journalists to produce them. Part of his statement read, “They used a fictitious and fake media platform, alleging that I had a meeting with the Peoples Democratic Party Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, at his Abuja residence, where I later briefed journalists on the reasons of the said meeting. “It was the same Yari and his people who recently faked a disciplinary letter from the APC national secretariat, instructing the leadership of the Yari faction in Zamfara to initiate disciplinary action against members of my faction, and purportedly expelling some of them. “The documents were later denied by Mr Nabena, the spokesperson for the APC National Working Committee.” Copyright PUNCH.
