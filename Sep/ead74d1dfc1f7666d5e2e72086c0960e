Chukwudi Akasike The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, on Wednesday, arrested seven persons for alleged Internet fraud. Among those arrested in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, were four siblings from two different families. Siblings were identified as Ayoola and Olusola Timilehin, and Oladayo and Tolulope Fayemi. The others suspected Internet fraudsters are Temitope Kumuyi, Babatunde Oyelakin and Olanrewaju Ibrahim. All the suspects are between the ages of 20 and 30. The EFCC said in a statement by its Head, Media and Publicity, Mr Dele Oyewale, that the suspects were apprehended by personnel of its Ibadan zonal office at their hideout in Alaka, Elebu area of the city. “They were arrested based on intelligence linking them with opulence without any identifiable means of livelihood,” the statement read in part. Items recovered from them, according to the anti-graft agency, are four cars, laptops, exotic phones and a stamp purportedly belonging to the bursary section of Queensland University’s School of Medicine, Australia. The EFCC said the suspects would be charged at the end of the ongoing investigation. Copyright PUNCH.
