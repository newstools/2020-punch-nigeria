Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Nigerian Railway Corporation on Tuesday said its Abuja-Kaduna train kA4 was not attacked by bandits on Monday. It described claims of an attack on the train service around Asham and Kubwa on Monday night as false. The Managing Director, NRC, Fidet Okhiria, told our correspondent that some hoodlums threw stones at the train, adding that one of the culprits was arrested. He explained that so many hoodlums were always found along the Abuja-Kaduna route and they often threw stones on moving trains. “Did you see any bullet on or in any of the coaches to confirm it was an attack by bandits?” Okhiria asked. He added, “They threw stones and the train stopped and one of them was arrested. They were not bandits as some people claimed.” The NRC boss said the corporation had reached out to security agencies to help curb such incidences on the Abuja-Kaduna route. Okhiria stated that after one of the hoodlums was arrested, many others came out at night to attack the train in protest against the arrest made in the afternoon. He said, “NRC has, however, spoken to security agencies to help us prevent such future occurrences and intervene in the matter, so they will know how best to deal with the situation. “We urge the public using the train not to panic as the Minister of Transportation and NRC will ensure the safety of Nigerians on that route.” It was also gathered that the trains that were operated on Monday on the Abuja-Kaduna route arrived their destinations.
