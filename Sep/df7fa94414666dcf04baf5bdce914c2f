Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State APC Governorship Campaign Council, on Sunday, received a boost as the Eziobe Traditional Council of Igarra, Akoko Edo Local Government Area, donated N2m to the campaign. The Head of the Eziobe Traditional Council and Otu of Igarra, High Chief Joseph Mayaki Akpeji, while presenting the cheque to the APC candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, in Benin City, said the council had promised to assist the party with N1m, but decided to increase the amount due to the enormous finances required to drive a successful governorship campaign and praised the integrity and resourcefulness of the candidate. Akpeji, who was represented by the Afekhai of Igarra, Attagun Illeya, said the traditional rulers were encouraged to support the APC candidate because they believed he would fulfil his promises and assured him of victory at the polls, noting that they had never supported an aspiration that failed. Ize-Iyamu said the kind gesture and those of plenty others had clearly demonstrated that the Edo people had accepted and keyed into his vision and mission to reposition the state. He stated that the gesture had reinforced his commitment to speedily revamp the moribund Ojirami Dam, attract investors to explore the vast deposits of natural resources, provide other social amenities and address security challenges in the area.
