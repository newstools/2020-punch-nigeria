Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Monday said its interventions in the rice value chain led to an increase in rice production in Nigeria by 1.2 million metric tonnes within three years. Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mustapha Shehuri, said this while assessing the Federal Government rice farms/mills in Omor and Umerum at Ayamelum Local Government Area, Anambra State, under the Agricultural Transformation Agenda Support Programme-1. Shehuri also stated that government would revitalise its rice farm in Anambra to boost rice production, create jobs and improve the living standard of people in the state and the region. He was quoted in a statement issued in Abuja by the agriculture ministry’s Chief Information Officer, Ezeaja Ikemefuna, as saying, “The present administration has provided various interventions to promote investment in the rice sector. “As a result of these interventions, the country has increased its production from 4.8 million metric tonnes of milled rice in 2015 to over six million metric tonnes by 2019 with huge reduction in the nation’s deficit.” He said the government was also pursuing and implementing programmes to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production because of its strategic importance as a major staple food crop.
