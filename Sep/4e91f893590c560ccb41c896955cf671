Johnny Edward  Napoli coach Gennaro Gattuso has told Victor Osimhen in clear terms that his goals for the Partenopei in pre-season counts for ‘nothing’as he looks set to lead the team’s attack ahead of the new season, The PUNCH reports. The Nigeria international bagged his second hat-trick for Napoli in their 4-0 win over Italian third division side, Teramo, on Friday. The treble took his tally to six coupled with three assists in two pre-season friendlies, since he completed his €80m move from Lille. But Gattuso still insists the 21-year-old must keep improving despite being involved in a goal in every 14 minutes in two pre-season friendlies according to Opta. “Osimhen is a quiet guy who has to work a lot. He has a lot of physicality, but it doesn’t have to be satisfied. The goals he scores right now don’t count for anything, but he fits in very well with the group. He jokes with everyone and makes himself loved,” Gattuso told Kiss Kiss Napoli. Osimhen is expected to make his first Serie A appearance against Parma on September 20. Meanwhile, Osimhen has reportedly found a home in Posillipo, Naples, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport. The report revealed that the striker has been living in a hotel as he awaits the keys to his new home in Posillipo. It was also revealed that he will live with his girlfriend Stephanie in Posillipo.
