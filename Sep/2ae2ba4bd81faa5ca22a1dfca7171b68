John Alechenu, Abuja Protesters from the Niger State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party on Wednesday stormed the PDP Legacy House in Maitama Abuja, venue of an ongoing PDP National Working Committee meeting, to demand the sacking of the party’s National Financial Secretary, Abdullahi Maibasira. The protesters accused Maibasira of conniving with the All Progressives Congress-led State Government to undermine the party. One of the protesters, who identified himself as Yahuza HussainI, a PDP member from Minna Local Government area told The PUNCH that the protest was organised to draw the attention of the national body to the alleged anti-party activity of the NWC member, whom they claimed was working with a former PDP leader in the state. Hussaini said, “We are here to tell our party leaders that we cannot continue to allow Maibasira and the former Speaker of Niger State House of Assembly, Tanko Bego to surrender our party to the APC Government in Niger State. “The leader of the PDP that we know in Niger is the former Governor Babangida Aliyu Talban Minna, he has remained in the PDP, even when these people left and came back.” The protesters, who have been conducting themselves peacefully, said they are prepared to wait until the NWC meeting ends to submit a petition to the party leadership. It was unclear whether those who are being accused are around as of the time of filing this report.
