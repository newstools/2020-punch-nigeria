Peter Dada, Akure Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has described the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Eyitayo Jegede (SAN), as a worthy opponent in the October 10 governorship election. He, however, dismissed the deputy governor and candidate of the Zenith Labour Party, Agboola Ajayi, as inconsequential. Akeredolu said this during a programme on Arise TV, in Akure, the state capital, on Monday. Akeredolu said, “Eyitayo Jegede is my colleague; he is a Senior Advocate of Nigeria; he is worthy of the office; I cannot see anything wrong with him. He is somebody I have a lot of respect for. He is eminently qualified to be a governor, unlike some people, who are not qualified to be a governor of this state. “But Agboola Ajayi of the ZLP, what has he got to offer this state? Nothing! But when it comes to Jegede, not because he is a SAN, but because he is learned; this state is not for a neophyte and a nincompoop. For me, Tayo (Jegede) is a gentleman and is good. I have nothing against him whatever happens at the end of the day, we will remain friends.” READ ALSO: CAN knocks Buhari as President says Trump asked why he’s killing Christians In response, the media aide to the deputy governor, Allen Sowore, said, “Again, Akeredolu’s macabre dance of shame on a national television on Monday, where he called his deputy a neophyte and nincompoop, and other unprintable names vindicates the deputy governor’s assessment of the governor as a man without character.”
