We just have to find a way around it, the only way is to put safety measures in place at our schools which we have done. “Government through the Ministry of Environment have fumigated all private and public schools across the state including tertiary institutions, apart from that, we have also provided enough safety materials for both students and their teachers in all the schools.”
