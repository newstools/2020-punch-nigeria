Ada Wodu, Calabar As the protest by the 2,500 workers whose names were removed from the Cross River State payroll enters day two, the workers have vowed to occupy the new secretariat until their names are reinstated. The workers who blocked all the gates leading to the secretariat on Tuesday, said they will bring their mats and cooking utensils to enable them occupy the secretariat indefinitely. Speaking on behalf of the protesting workers who chanted solidarity songs, Chairman, Niger Delta Activists Forum, Cross River State chapter, Comrade Paul Ajie said, “We are here in solidarity with over 2,500 Cross River State civil servants that were delisted from the payroll. They have made several efforts to get their names reinstated into the payroll which fell on deaf ears. The only option is to engage in a peaceful protest. We will sustain it as long as it will take government to reinstate them. “Government has not reacted. It shows that it is a deliberate action. We gave a one week ultimatum which expired yesterday(Monday). The protest is indefinite. It will end the day the workers will get alert. “Tomorrow we will set our pots here because now we are buying food. It will be more economical to cook here. We will bring our mats here. Yesterday we closed too early, at about 1pm, and we were told that some senior civil servants came and did some assignments. “We are open for discussions. When they are ready and sincere, not that type that has lasted for 13 months.”
No government official was available to address the workers.
