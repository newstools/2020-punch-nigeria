Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on Thursday night announced that it has obtained a prepayment funding of about $1 billion to support the upstream operations of its subsidiary, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company. It said the crude oil prepayment had enabled NNPC to pay NPDC’s tax obligations to the Federal Government of about $700m with the balance utilised to fund NPDC’s capital and operating expenditures. NNPC said in a statement issued by is spokesperson, Kennie Obateru, that the prepayment financing was backed by future oil production of NPDC.

It said the tranches shall be repaid by Eagle Export Funding Limited from the export sale proceeds of the NPDC crude, which in turn were backed by Letters of Credit, issued by banks with a minimum credit rating, in line with market precedent.
