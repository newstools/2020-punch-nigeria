Kelvin Ekerete Nigerian striker, Odion Ighalo, may be included in Manchester United’s starting lineup in a Carabao Cup fixture against Luton Town on Tuesday (today). Manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed he will make changes to the side that lost 3-1 to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in their English Premier League opener on Saturday. Ighalo made a cameo appearance against Palace, replacing Timothy Fosu-Mensah in the 81st minute, but failed to save his team from the embarrassing loss. However, Solskjaer confirms that some players are in need of more minutes. “We’ll make some changes,” Ole Solskjaer United’s media team on Monday after the team training. “For some, it’s the pre-season, and for some, they’ve only been here for a week now, for different reasons. Some of them need game-time, they do and we can see we’re lacking in sharpness. We just need to make the most of the training sessions and games we have.” “We’ll rotate and give some minutes. Some, after the game, will do some harder training this week to get ready for Brighton. Some will join the squad and go down there.” Ighalo, who is currently on loan at United from Chinese Super League side, Shanghai Shenhua, scored five goals in eight Cup games for the Red Devils in the 2019/20 league season.
