Tunde Oyekola Ilorin Over 100,000 hectares of rice, maize, cassava and millet farms have been destroyed by flood in Pategi town, in the Patigi Local Government Area of Kwara State. Also, no fewer than 20,000 farmers have been reportedly displaced by flood in Moro, Edu, Pategi and Ilorin South and Ilorin West council areas. One of the residents of the area, Mallam Ismaila Adamu, said flooding was not strange in Pategi. “But this time it entered every house, drowning people and taking away their belongings. “The flood also submerged schools, hospitals and other infrastructure, including electricity polls,” he said. Gbaradogi, a settlement three kilometers away from Pategi town, was also submerged in flood. Muhammed Isa, who is married with two wives and 13 children, said he lost all his means of livelihood to the disaster. “It wreaked no less havoc on over 100 communities like this in Patigi local government area,” he said. Meanwhile, the Kwara State Government has commiserated with the victims of flooding, which affected some communities in the state.  The state deputy governor, Mr Kayode Alabi, who was on an assessment tour to flood-affected parts of Edu and Patigi local government areas assured the victims of the government’s support to alleviate their plight.
