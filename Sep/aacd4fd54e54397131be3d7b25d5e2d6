Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin Edo State sports community and the state butchers on Wednesday threw their weight behind the re-election of Governor Godwin Obaseki. The sport community march through major streets of Benin with participants drawn from Bendel Insurance, Edo Queen, weight  lifters, wrestlers, boxers, coaches and workers of the Edo State Sports Commission. The Deputy Governor of the state, Philip Shaibu said the sports family had benefited from the administration of Governor Godwin Obaseki and that it was time for the sports family to reciprocate the good gesture of the governor. He said, “The Governor has performed. He called me at the inception of this administration and told me that he has the plan to create jobs for the teaming Edo youths through sports. We went round to check sports facilities on ground. We discovered that the facilities on ground were built by the late Samuel Ogbemudia. We remodeled the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium to become the best in Africa.” Also, the  Association of Edo State Practicing Butchers held a walk around major streets in the states that terminated at the NUJ complex. Leader of the group, Akhere Odigie, said they came out to rally round Obaseki based on his developmental strides in the state. “The Edo state butcher, in totality,  have agreed that Obaseki, is our next governor. He shall continue to occupy Osadebe Avenue till 2024 because of his developmental strides and the programmes he has lined up in the association of Edo state butchers.” Copyright PUNCH.
