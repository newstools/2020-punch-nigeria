Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia The Commissioner of Police in Abia State, Mrs Janet Agbede, on Wednesday, paraded two suspected assassins identified as Victor Onyekachi and Emmanuel Okorie. The CP, in a statement made available to our correspondent, stated that the suspects were “arrested following a petition by one Mark Ogbonnaya of Amaogudu Ahaba Imenyi in Isuikwuato Local Government Area that he was attacked and robbed of his Samsung Galaxy S9 plus phone valued N400,000 and Infinix phone valued at N 48,500”. The complainant also added that N357,000 cash was collected from him, while he was forced to make a transfer of N100, 000 into an account number provided by the suspects, who came in military uniform. The CP stated that on receiving the complainant the men of the Special Anti-robbery Squad swung into action and arrested the suspects and recovered the two phones. The suspects, however, confessed that they were hired by a man, identified as Uche, to assassinate the complainant. One of the suspects said, “We went to Uche to ask for help but he told us that he had a job for us. That was how he asked us to go and kill Ogbonnaya. He threatened to kill us if we exposed his plans. “He gave us guns and military uniform for operation, but when we got to the man’s house we exposed Uche’s plans to him because we didn’t want to kill him but we collected phones and money from him.” Also in the Police custody was a suspected child trafficker identified as Ihechi Ogbonna. The CP explained that the suspect who feigned insanity on her arrest later confessed to the crime. Also paraded by the State Police command were 41 suspects arrested for various crimes including armed robbery, cultism, and kidnapping. Exhibits recovered from the suspects were locally made guns, live cartridge, an axe, mobile phones, and substance suspected to be Indian hemp.
