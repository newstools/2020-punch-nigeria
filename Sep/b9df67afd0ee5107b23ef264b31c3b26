Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Gunmen in the early hours of Friday invaded Barkallahu, Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State, and kidnapped seven persons, five of whom are members of the same family. The bandits, it was gathered, invaded the community at about 1:30am on Friday and shot indiscriminately as they went from house to house to pick their victims. One Abdulsalam Haruna, a resident of the area, said the gunmen went away with his wife and four children, adding that two of his children were students of the Federal University, Malunfashi, in Katsina State. Haruna also said the hoodlums left with two of his neighbour’s children and attacked  two other houses in the area, including that of a retired director in the Kaduna State Ministry of Education. “The incident happened at about 1:30am (on Friday). They broke my gate and came into my compound. They broke the door to my house and ordered everybody to follow them. “They went away with my wife and four of my children, two of which are students of the Federal University, Malumfashi, Katsina state. They also attacked my neighbour and went away with two of his children. “Two other houses, including that of a retired director in the Kaduna State Ministry of Education, were also attacked, but they did not kidnap anybody or carry anything there. We alerted security personnel, but by the time they arrived, the bandits had escaped with the victims.” The Kaduna State Police Command had yet to confirm the incident as the Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, could not be reached. Jalige had also yet to reply to a text message sent to his mobile phone as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH.
