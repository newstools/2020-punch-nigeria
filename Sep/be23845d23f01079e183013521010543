Sodiq Oyeleke Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has expressed displeasure over the conduct of the ongoing governorship election in the state. He said the Independent National Electoral Commission should have prepared better for the election. Obaseki spoke after casting his vote at Polling Unit 19, Ward 4, Oredo Local Government Area. The governor lamented that he stayed for over one and a half hours in the queue. The Peoples Democratic Party candidate in the election said he was delayed because the card reader was slow.

To wait for one and a half hours on the queue before exercising my franchise is a bit disappointing. “Given that this is a sole day’s election, I expected better planning and preparation and resources should have been put into this election. “At the last presidential election, in my polling unit, there were two polling points which eased the burden on voters. You all are witnesses to how long it has taken. “The card reader here is working slowly, and this is the situation in all the major voting centres in Oredo Local Government Area of the state as I speak. “At Garrick Memorial School, I understand that over 500 voters are already stranded because they can’t vote due to the slow processing of the card reader. “One would have expected that INEC will have deployed more card readers and more voting points in high-density polling centres.”
