John Alechenu, Abuja Former President Dr. Goodluck Jonathan has proposed a grading system for elections within Commonwealth member-nations as a means of improving the quality of elections, promoting democracy and strengthening institutions. Jonathan who is the Chairman of the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation, advised the 53-member nation body to develop what he called a “democracy marker” which is a benchmarking system of election reporting to serve as a scoring formula for measuring compliance to identified democracy standards within the Commonwealth. He stated this at a special virtual High-Level panel which focused on 40 years of Commonwealth’s election observation experience. This was contained in a statement by his media aide, Ikechukwu Eze, on Thursday. The former Nigerian leader was quoted in the statement as saying, “I associate myself with the efforts to improve Commonwealth election observer experience in line with the Revised Commonwealth Guidelines for the Conduct of Election Observation in Member Countries. “As in any human experience, we can always seek to further strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of our involvement and enhance the impact it will have in ensuring the sustainability of democracy among Commonwealth member nations.” Copyright PUNCH.
