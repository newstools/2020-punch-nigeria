Kelvin Ekerete Victor Osimhen’s agent Andrea D’Amico has backed the Nigerian to show his quality and excel for Napoli when the season begins. Napoli are billed to face Parma on September 20, in their season opener. Osimhen failed to hit target in Napoli’s 4-0 friendly win over Pescara on September 11, after he scored hat-tricks in his first two friendly games for the club against L’Aquila and Serie C side, Teramo. But D’Amico believes the 21-year-old will show his importance at the start of the season. “Osimhen in trouble in the match against Pescara? These are the first releases. Sometimes you are too demanding. I’m sure he will demonstrate his qualities, both as a scorer and as an important player within the team. (Gennaro) Gattuso doesn’t need any advice, he had a long eye already as a player,” D’Amico told spazionapoli.it via Marte Sport Live. The Super Eagles striker didn’t have a chance to prove himself in the team’s final friendly tie against Sporting Lisbon following the game’s cancellation, after several players of the Portuguese side tested positive for COVID-19. Osimhen joined the Italian side from Lille for €81m, plus add-ons, after an impressive debut season with the French club. Copyright PUNCH.
