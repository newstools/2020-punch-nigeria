Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The abductors of a retired United States of America Army officer, Major Jide Ijadare, and one other at a palm oil factory on Wednesday demanded N20 million ransom from the former soldier’s family for his release. The gunmen, who invaded the factory belonging to the former army officer along Ijan Ekiti–Ise Ekiti Road in Ijan Ekiti in the Gbonyin Council area of Ekiti State on Tuesday shot dead a man identified as a contractor and whisked away Ijadare and one other person at the factory. A member of the family of Ijadare said the abductors told journalists on the telephone that the abductors had contacted one of them and demanded N20 million ransom to facilitate his release. He said, “They contacted one of the family members this morning (Wednesday) and made that demand.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Mr Sunday Abutu, however, said the command was not aware of any ransom being demanded by the abductors, saying, “We are not aware of any ransom being demanded by the abductors. “But our men are in the bush combing everywhere to ensure his release. The Commissioner of Police, Mr Babatunde Mobayo, has deployed different units of police operatives in the factory and the surrounding forests.” Meanwhile, the Ekiti State Coordinator, National Youths Service Corps, Mrs Mary Nnenna Chikezie, dismissed reports that it was a corps member that was shot dead at the factory where two persons including the former American military officer and one other were abducted. Chikezie said, “I wish to inform the general public that no corps member is at present serving at the said factory; hence, no corps member was gunned down. It is, therefore, imperative to further place on record that the NYSC scheme places in its priority, the security and welfare of corps members”.
