Kelvin Ekerete Super Eagles defender, William Troost-Ekong, on Monday arrived England ahead of a potential move to Championship side Watford on Tuesday (today). According to a report on Watford Observer, the Hornets have made a move for the Nigerian international. Troost-Ekong was an unused substitute in Udinese’s 1-0 loss away at Verona in their Serie A opener on Sunday. According to reports, the Eagles defender has said goodbye to his teammates and is set to complete a permanent move from the fellow Giampaolo Pozzo-owned club. Watford manager, Vladimir Ivic, had previously described Troost-Ekong as a quality player and will be a good addition to the squad if he joined the Championship side as they hope to return to the top flight. “I know him as a quality player and he will be one of the players who will help us in the future if he will join us,” Ivic said after the goalless draw at Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday. The Nigerian made a total of 66 appearances for the Bianconerisince after joining from Turkish side, Bursaspor in 2018. Troost-Ekong represented the Netherlands at the youth level before switching allegiance to Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH.
