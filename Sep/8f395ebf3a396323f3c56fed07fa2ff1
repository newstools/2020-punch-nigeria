Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Tuesday commenced the deployment of professional treasury officers to revenue generating ministries, departments and agencies in a bid to improve the country’s revenue base. Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said an important sector with huge potential was the revenue generation arm of the Federal Government Owned Entities. Ahmed spoke in Abuja at the orientation for directors of revenue in FGOEs organised by the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation. She said, “You may all wish to know that analysis of budgets of some of the FGOEs shows that these entities have the capacities, if properly managed, to significantly improve the revenue base of the Federal Government. “It is in this light that the deployment of the treasury directors is considered expedient to the selected FGOEs as a pilot test.” The minister explained that the deployment of directors of revenue to the FGOEs was in compliance with presidential approval that was conveyed via the Secretary to the Government of the Federation’s circular with reference SGF.50/S.3/C.9/24, dated October 16, 2018. She said the circular was on the approved Revenue Performance Management Framework for Government Owned Enterprises. Ahmed said the government was increasingly concerned about the dwindling profile of revenues, adding that the trend had to be quickly arrested particularly with key revenue generating agencies of government.
