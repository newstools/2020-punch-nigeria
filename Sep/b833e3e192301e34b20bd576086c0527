Peter Dada, Akure The Zenith Labour Party on Wednesday accused the All Progressives Congress of sponsoring thugs to attack the campaign office of its governorship candidate, Mr. Agboola Ajayi, on Tuesday. The Director-General of the Agbo/Gboye Campaign Organisation, Dr Kola Ademujimi, said attacks on ZLP campaign offices in recent times had become worrisome. He said, “Akeredolu’s thugs are threatening the lives and properties of members of ZLP and those of other parties in the state. They destroyed chairs, tables, and inflicted injuries on our supporters at their ward meeting in Ile-Oluji yesterday (Tuesday). “They also destroyed Agboola Ajayi’s billboards at our campaign office in Akure. They destroyed our flags and posters in Idanre during Aketi/APC’s campaign tour of Idanre on Tuesday. They attacked leaders of another party during their local government meeting in Owo yesterday. I think they are out to cause mayhem even before the October governorship election in Ondo State.” In response, the spokesman for the Akeredolu/Ayedatiwa Campaign Organisation, Mr Richard Olatunde, while denying the allegations, said, “Their political popularity has refused to grow. It is a rejected party with no political structure. “In fact, we have it on good authority that they orchestrate the attack on themselves just to drag us into issues with them. We are not ready to join issues with a party that has been rejected by the people of Ondo State.”
