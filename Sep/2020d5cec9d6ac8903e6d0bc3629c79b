Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A former Chief of Defence Staff, Lt. Gen. Alani Akinrinade (retd.), has advised the Federal Government to allow regional security outfits to transform into state police. He, however, recommended that institutional and constitutional mechanism be put in place to check arbitrary use of the state policing structures. Akinrinade spoke on Saturday in his Yakoyo, Osun State country home, while receiving a team from the state Ministry of Information and Civic Engagement, led by the Special Adviser to Governor Adegboyega Oyetola on Civic Engagement, Mr Olatunbosun Oyintiloye. In a statement by Oyintiloye on Sunday titled: ‘Security should be community-driven – Gen. Akinrinade’, made available to The PUNCH in Osogbo, the ex-CDS commended efforts of regional security outfits in tackling security challenges facing the country, adding that efforts to secure the nation should be community-driven rather than being based on a centralised structure. Akinrinade emphasised the need for the Federal Government to embrace state police “by giving the leverage for all regional security outfits such as Amotekun in the South-West and Hisbah in the North, among others, to metamorphose into state policing structures.” Reacting to the move to subsume the Amotekun security initiative under community policing of the Nigeria Police Force, the elder statesman said a state should not be expected to use its resources to run a policing system that was not exclusively under its supervision. He suggested that a state should be allowed to use its resources for its own policing arrangement backed up by legislative enactment. Copyright PUNCH.
