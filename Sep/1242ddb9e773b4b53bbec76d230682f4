Speaking ill of other people and spreading gossip is worse than Covid-19 and Satan is the worst offender of all, Pope Francis said Sunday. When people see someone making a mistake, “the first thing we usually do is go and tell someone else about it.

Satan “is a liar who seeks to divide the Church, to drive our brothers apart, so that they are no longer a community,” he added. “Let us make an effort not to be gossips. Speaking ill of people is a plague worse than COVID,” the pope said in an address at Saint Peter’s. (AFP)
