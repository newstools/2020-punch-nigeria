Joseph Olaoluwa The Government of Bayelsa State has solicited the partnership of the Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency towards establishing a maritime academy and developing its deep seaport. Governor Douye Diri who paid a courtesy visit to the NIMASA Director-General, Dr Bashir Jamoh, on Monday in Lagos, said the state had re-opened the process of establishing the academy and recognised the agency as central to actualising the project. A statement by the Acting Chief Press Secretary of Bayelsa State, Mr Daniel Alabrah, said the administration planned to tap into the wealth residing in the state’s maritime environment for the benefit of the nation. Diri said, “This is the beginning of an improved relationship between NIMASA and the people of Bayelsa State. “We are both bound by a common denominator, which is water. Bayelsa is a wholly riverine state with all its local governments and their headquarters accessible by river and rivulets.” The governor also called on the agency to clear wrecks on the waterways in the state as they posed a serious threat to vessels and result in accidents, especially at night.
