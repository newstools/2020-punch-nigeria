Everton have made three splashes in the transfer market recently, luring Allan, Abdoulaye Doucoure and James Rodriguez to Goodison Park. The Toffees impressed in their 1-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, and will now be looking to kick on. Manager Carlo Ancelotti may want some more signings to come in yet, but Everton should first look to clear the decks with some sales. The Mirror reported on Tuesday that Everton are considering offloading a number of players, with Alex Iwobi and Italian striker Moise Kean tipped for exits. Everton paid £34m to sign Iwobi from Arsenal last summer, but he failed to really live up to the price tag last season. The Nigerian showed moments of quality, but mustered just two goals and one assist last season – and wasn’t on the bench against Spurs on Sunday. Everton fans have now been reacting to the news that Iwobi would be sold, with some believing that he ‘offers nothing’, has been ‘really poor’ and ‘needs to go’. Others want to see him used in a part-exchange deal for Wilfried Zaha, with a belief that he just won’t fit in under Ancelotti. “Iwobi needs to go tho,” @EFC891 tweeted. Also, @africansunset73 added, “Iwobi yes as I just don’t see him fitting in going forward and we are overloaded in his position, Kean needs another year as selling him would leave us short.” @sicurrie stated, “Can see Iwobi going as part of Zaha coming in but don’t see them giving up on Kean yet,” while @RiddledBlues2 wrote, “Think someone like Iwobi will be easier to get shut of.”
