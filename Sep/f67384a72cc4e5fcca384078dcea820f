Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan Students, workers, and civil society groups hit the streets of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, on Tuesday, to express displeasure at the hike in the price of petrol as well as the increase of electricity tariff. The protesters, who carried placards with different inscriptions to convey their disapproval, while chanting anti-government songs, gathered at the Awolowo Junction area of the state capital. The protesters condemned the policies of the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), describing the recent increment in the prices of electricity and fuel as wicked and one that lacked sound judgment. The Chairman, Joint Campus Committee of the National Association of Nigerian Students, Mayowa Opakunle, told The PUNCH that students in the state totally reject the increases. Opakunle said, “We are out on the streets to register our grievances and show our displeasure at the wicked policies and unjust treatment of Nigerians by the Federal Government. “We say no to fuel price hike and electricity tariff increment at this period when many people have lost their jobs, many have not even been paid salaries for the past six months. “Prices of food, other goods and services have continued to increase while salaries are either being slashed into half for so many while others don’t even get at all.

The consistent show of ineptitude and cluelessness on the part of the President and his cabinet is worrisome.” Also, the immediate past chairman of Trade Union Congress in Oyo State, Andrew Emelieze, also condemned the increment, saying it would further impoverish the masses.
