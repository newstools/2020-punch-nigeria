Kelvin Ekerete A total of 65 athletes on Friday received palliatives from Atlanta 1996 Olympic gold medalist, Chioma Ajunwa-Opara. Ajunwa, an Assistant Commissioner of Police, gave out the palliatives at the Police College in Lagos, through the Chioma Ajunwa Foundation in conjunction with Arestone Tyres and A-GOAL Nigeria. “I decided to lend a helping hand to these athletes. Since the beginning of the lockdown, it hasn’t been easy for a lot of them. There is no better time to help them but now. They are about to go back to training ahead of the 2020 Olympics and other competitions and that was why I decided to partner with 1-GOAL Nigeria and Arestone Tyres,” Ajunwa told journalists in Lagos. “I am sure this will motivate them to train harder ahead of forthcoming competitions.” Inspector Austin Okporu, a boxing and kickboxing coach, said, “I’m very happy with the initiative. I never believed such a thing could happen to athletes that train at the Police College, it’s a welcome development and we are hoping other bodies will do the same.” A police constable and short distance track and field athlete, Nwo Pauline, as well as mixed martial artist, Kingsley Ajunwa, also hailed the initiative. “I feel elated for what Ajunwa did for the athletes. It will go a long way in relieving the athletes pains,” Nwo, a beneficiary, told Saturday PUNCH. Items such as eggs, beverages, and detergents were part of the palliatives distributed by Ajunwa at the event. Copyright PUNCH.
