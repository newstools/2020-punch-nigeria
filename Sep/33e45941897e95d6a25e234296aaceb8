’Tosin Oluwalowo Alex Iwobi may struggle for playing time at English Premier League side, Everton, following the arrival of Colombian and 2014 World Cup Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez. Iwobi, who joined Everton last summer after spending seven years at Arsenal, failed to flourish in his first season with The Toofees. Since arriving at Goodison Park, the 24-year-old has played 29 times in all competitions, scoring two goals, with a solitary assist. The Super Eagles star will need to impress at Goodson Park to get into the side’s starting 11 after Rodriguez joined from Real Madrid on Monday. Rodriguez, who has worked with Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti twice – at Madrid and Bayern Munich – will be hoping to revive his career after failing to impress at Madrid, after joining the Spanish giants for £71m following a stellar performance at the 2014 World Cup. He however joined Bayern on a two-season loan deal in 2017 following his inabilty to impress Zinedine Zidane. Despite not getting much playing time at Madrid, the Colombian still created the sixth highest chances and assists during his time in Spain Asides Rodriguez, Iwobi would also have to compete for playing time with Allan, who joined from Napoli and Abdoulaye Doucoure, who moved to the Merseyside club from Watford.
