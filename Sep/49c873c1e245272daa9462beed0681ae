Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia The chairman of the Abia State chapter of the All Progressive Grand Alliance,  Chief Nkem Okoro, on Tuesday led other members to dump the party and join the All Progressives Congress. Okoro, while speaking at the APC state secretariat in Umuahia, said “Our decision to join the APC became more cogent and expedient, after the leader of the party in Abia state and a respected Abia son, Dr. Alex Otti joined the party with thousands of APGA supporters recently. “Present here with me today are members of the State Working Committee, the 17 L.G.A Chairmen and the ward Chairmen of the 184 wards of the state, as well as former state and LGA officers of the party.” The state APC chairman, Chief Donatus Nwamnkpa while receiving the new entrants said the doors of the party were open to as many people who share the vision of progressive politics.
