Nigeria winger Moses Simon has drilled boreholes for the people of Obagaji Agatu community in Agatu Local Government Area of Benue State. The Nigeria international’s father hails from Obagaji Agatu but the Nantes winger was raised in Kaduna State. The Head of Obagaji Agatu community, Chief James Ocheche, said they’ve been reliant on rainwater or water from the stream, for their daily usage and consumption, before Simon lent a helping hand. He thanked Simon for coming to the community’s aid, saying the footballer’s gesture was a sign that he felt the pains of his people.” “Early this year, a brother of Simon said he (Simon) is concerned about the source of our drinking water and other social amenities in the community. “He was sympathetic enough to sink three boreholes as an individual. You can see that he is a boy who wants the development of his community. May God lift him up.” The project is one of numerous embarked upon by the 25-year-old this year. He reached out to Internally Displaced Persons of Southern Kaduna, donating clothes, food and drugs, paying for their free medical service and N500,000. Copyright PUNCH.
