Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Peoples Democratic Party, Edo State Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, has commended the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare 11, for initiating a peace meeting following the violence trailing the governorship election campaign. Nehikhare said, “We appreciate his majesty for his fatherly role in calling for the peace meeting. We appreciate him and for us in the PDP we are going to take it seriously. “We encourage the police to investigate and prosecute all those that have been indicted to serve as a deterrent to other trouble makers in the state.” Also, the Edo Equity Forum on Thursday commended Oba Ewuare 11 for the peace meeting. The spokesman for the group, Benjamin Omoigui, said the meeting was in the interest of the Edo people. Omoigui said, “We know that this intervention is for the benefit of Edo people and the PDP which will gain nothing from the continued violent attacks on its members and the electorate. “This is because Edo people have been emphatic in their choice of the PDP and their support has been absolute and unflinching.” Copyright PUNCH.
