Abiodun Nejo and Gbenga Odogun The Ekiti and Kogi state schapters of the Peoples Democratic Party, as well as a former Ekiti State Governor, Chief Segun Oni, in separate statements on Tuesday, congratulated the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, for his victory in last Saturday’s governorship election. A factional chairman of the PDP in Ekiti State, Bisi Kolawole, in his massage on behalf of the faction, praised “the determination and the collective efforts of Edo people for defending their votes.” Kolawole, in the statement signed by the PDP Publicity Secretary, Raphael Adeyanju, said, “As we draw the curtain on the Edo State election and are all set for the next one in Ondo State, I call on all stakeholders to borrow a leaf from the activities before the last election and pray for victory at the next polls.” Also, Oni, a former governor of Ekiti State, on his part congratulated Obaseki and said the governor’s victory showed that “people’s power is mightier than any power in political pursuit.” Similarly, the Kogi State chapter of the PDP in a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary, Bode Ogunmola, on Tuesday, described Obaseki’s victory as “well deserved,” adding that the victory had dealt a deadly blow on godfatherism in Nigerian politics.
