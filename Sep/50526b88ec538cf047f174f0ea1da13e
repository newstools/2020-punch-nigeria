Maiharaji Altine, Gusau Members of Kabiru Garba Marafa’s faction of the All Progressives Congress in Zamfara State have disassociated themselves from his activities, describing him as a spoiler. Briefing newsmen on Tuesday, the members who were led by the ward chairmen forum of Kabiru Marafa’s faction of the APC, Alhaji Shafi,i Musa, from the Anka local Government Area of the state said, “We are no more with senator Marafa because of his ill intention to finally kill APC in Zamfara.” Musa stated that, Marafa was a spoiler who was working tirelessly against APC in the state. According to him, Marafa was currently romancing with the PDP led government in Zamfara state where 30 percent of political appointments went to his (Marafa’s) political loyalists. He cited example with the current SSG, Alhaji Bala Bello Maru, the commissioner of Rural Development, Alhaji Abubakar Abdullahi; and a permanent commissioner of the state Hajj commission, Alhaji Maikatako who were Marafa’s political loyalists. He further explained that Marafa had also brought Accord Party in the state during the last general elections as an option for him to achieve his political ambition if the APC failed to nominate him as its governorship candidate. Frantic efforts were made to speak to Senator Marafa failed because he was not in the state at the time of filing in this report, while all his telephone numbers were not reachable. Copyright PUNCH.
