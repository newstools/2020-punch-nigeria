Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Authorities of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, on Tuesday told the public to disregard a circular purportedly issued and signed by the university Registrar on reopening plans. A statement by the Public Relations Officer of the university, Abiodun Olarewaju, said the Federal Government that shut the institution in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, had not reversed the order. The statement read in parts, “The university Management wishes to officially inform our students at all levels, their parents and guardians that the said circular is fake and malicious both in content and context and it should be disregarded in its entirety. “Obafemi Awolowo University is a Federal Government-owned institution and the instruction to go on recess in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, in the month of March 2020, by the Federal Government has not been reversed.” Copyright PUNCH.
