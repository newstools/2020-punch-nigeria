John Alechenu, Abuja Elder statesman and foremost Ijaw leader, Chief Edwin Clark, has said the peaceful conduct of the Edo State Governorship Election and its outcome has given hope that Nigeria is on the path of strengthening its democracy. He said this in a statement titled “Edo Elections: Chief Clark commends President Muhammadu Buhari, congratulates Governor Obaseki, his Deputy, Philip Shuabu, PDP, and the good people of Edo State,” which he signed in Abuja, on Wednesday. Clark said, “It is worthy of note to observe that it is a nascent sign of credible electoral processes in our country if the positive things that happened are sustained and improved upon. “It is for this reason that I want to highly commend His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, for his roles and admonitions he gave to the politicians, the electoral umpire and the security agencies that for once, under his watch, INEC was able to conduct a free, fair and credible election, and the security agencies conducted themselves professionally, before, during and after the election. “This is a great departure from what was obtained in previous elections in the country, like the 2018 Osun election, and last year’s Rivers, Kogi and Bayelsa Governorship elections, just to mention a few. “President Muhammad Buhari deserves to be commended and appreciated by all well-meaning Nigerians for his new disposition and commitment to free, fair and credible elections in the country.” He added that “in the past, we had condemned Mr. President for being behind the audacious abuses of the electoral system, with the deployment of the so-called ’federal might’ to harass, intimidate, and deny citizens of their democratic rights”.
