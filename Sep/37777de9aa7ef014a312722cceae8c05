Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The wife of the Edo State governorship candidate of the All Progressive Congress in the September 19th 2020 election, Prof. Idia Ize-Iyamu, has revealed plans by her husband, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, to establish a special victims’ unit to combat sexual assault. The unit, according to her, will care for survivors of rape and other gender-based violence if elected. Mrs. Ize Iyamu said this on a television programme monitored in Benin, on Thursday. She described her husband as a compassionate person, a strong believer in the capacity of women to inspire change in the society and contribute to growth when provided with an enabling environment and offered the right support. She said, “I am an empowered woman because my husband, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, supported me all the way. I had just completed my university education when we got married and he told me not to rest on my laurels. He actively supported me in my academic journey to becoming a Professor.” Copyright PUNCH.
