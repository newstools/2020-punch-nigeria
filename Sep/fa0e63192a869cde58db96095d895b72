John Charles Makurdi Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Thursday advocated parliamentary system of government for the country. Ortom, who stated this during the inauguration of the committee to prepare Benue Stateâ€™s report to the National Assembly Committee for the review of the 1999 Constitution, said the system was not only cost effective, but also provides opportunities for power sharing. The governor said the parliamentary system of government would enable smaller parties to participate in governance to the extent of their electoral performance. He explained that the parliamentary system was more accountable and would provide for regular interface between the leaders of the executive and the representatives of the people, adding that it was less complex. While decrying the current practice in which the Federal Government had nearly 100 per cent constitutional powers, the governor said states and local government councils were only able to function in 30 per cent, a situation he described as a distortion of the spirit and practice of federalism.
