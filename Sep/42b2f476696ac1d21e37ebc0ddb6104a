Oladimeji Ramon The Lagos State Special Offences Court in Ikeja on Friday sentenced one Paul Adesanya to 21 years’ imprisonment for defrauding an American-based woman, Mrs Oluwatoyin Akinwole, of the sum of N36.7m. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission also told Justice Mojisola Dada that Adesanya posted Akinwole’s nude pictures on the social media, and thereafter reported that she committed suicide by jumping over the Third Mainland Bridge, Lagos, in 2017. The prosecuting counsel for the EFCC, Samuel Daji, said Adesanya acted contrary to sections 1(1) and 1(3) of the Advance Fee Fraud Act; as well as sections 278 and 285 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State. In her judgment on Friday, Justice Dada convicted Adesanya of the three counts filed against him by the EFCC. The judge said she was satisfied that the prosecution proved the charges beyond reasonable doubts. “I hereby sentence you to 14 years’ imprisonment on counts one and two, from the date of arraignment. These sentences are to run concurrently. “On count three, for stealing, the convict is sentenced to seven years in prison,” the judge held. The prosecutor thanked the judge for “a well-considered judgment.” Copyright PUNCH.
