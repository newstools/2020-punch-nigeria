Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The All Progressives Congress in Edo State has alleged foul play in the September 19 Governorship election in the state. It, however, called on party members to stay calm while party leaders study the result and decide what is next. The Chairman of the APC Media Campaign Council, John Mayaki, said “the party rejects the result”, citing alleged “strong-arm tactics”.

It further alleged illicit tampering with results. “Areas where we won, they cancelled them. They decreased the votes in areas we had advantages,” the party further claimed. “They rejected our results and jerked up theirs.” Meanwhile, the party also claimed that there was an arbitrary arrest of local party members. “Obaseki shouted that he was being rigged out and blamed INEC at the initial stage but that was to divert attention from the evil going on in the field,” the statement said. The party thanked party members for their support, adding that “leaders would announce their decision and course of action as soon as possible”.
