Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi No fewer than 1,279 ghost workers, including 100 doctors, have been found in the payroll of the Bauchi State Ministry of Health. The state governor, Bala Mohammed, said this on Thursday during an interactive session with stakeholders on the challenges associated with payment of salaries in the state. He said, “I am sad, very sad that by acts of commission, collusion and distortion, our state, Bauchi is facing a monumental task of sorting out what is clearly a corrupted salary regime. “Ghost workers, civil servants falsifying allowances and other fraud in payrolls have frozen employment. “In fact in Bauchi State, one can easily be a pensioner, get paid without ever working and can even earn arrears in payment. We have schools with several teachers captured on the payroll. When you pay a visit, you will see no teachers or at best three, where 20 were employed. “Presently, we have identified and removed 1,279 staff from the payroll of the state Ministry of Health, among them almost 100 doctors collecting salaries when they are not physically on ground.” He said in the Ministry of Education, 6,000 workers reflected on the payroll, while the Head of Service had a record of 5,000. Mohammed also said 111 staff members, whose salaries were stopped by the state treasurer due to inconsistencies recorded between their nominal and payroll records. The governor lamented that in 2015, the salary bill for Bauchi State combined was less than N4.5bn, but currently, the wage bill in the state neared the N7bn despite the fact that there was no employment. He vowed that all those involved in the sharp practices would be brought to book. Copyright PUNCH.
