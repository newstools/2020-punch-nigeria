Daud Olatunji and Grace Edema BABCOCK University Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State, has confirmed that it asked each student resuming for the first semester of the 2020/2021 academic session to pay N25,000 for a COVID-19 test. The university explained that it could not afford to toy with lives of its staff and students on the school premises. The Director of Marketing and Communication, Dr. Joshua Suleiman, disclosed this while responding to questions from our correspondents on Tuesday. Suleiman said the school would have asked the returning students to do the test elsewhere and present the certificate, but was mindful of fake certificates. He said, “Babcock University returning students are expected to be screened for COVID-19 on arrival at the subsidised cost of N25,000 at the BUTH. “They will do it at BUTH so that we can vouch for the authenticity of the result. We want to avoid a situation where some people may bring in fake COVID-19 result. We don’t want to risk the life of any of our students or staff. “They are also to resume with their personal safety kits, including an infrared thermometer (for those that can afford them), a pack of disposable face masks or three reusable ones as well as hand sanitisers.” While speaking on the internal arrangement made for further safety of the students, Suleiman said “the institution will resume in two batches – first to resume are the final year students in 400 Level, 500 and 600 Levels) next Monday and others on October 25. On the allegation of hike in the school fees, the spokesman of the university denied the allegation. Copyright PUNCH.
