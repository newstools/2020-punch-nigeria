Temiloluwa O’Peters Nigerian e-hailing drivers and lease partners’ umbrella body, Professional E-Hailing Drivers and Private-Owners Association, recently took to the streets of Lagos to protest what they called unhealthy business practices. The union’s President, Idris Shonuga, said their demonstration was concerning Uber and Bolt alleged mistreatments. He said the app companies had been taking unilateral decisions, fixing low fares and taking high commissions. According to him, the companies had slashed the prices by 60 per cent in 2017, due to their unhealthy competition. He said this was to the detriment of the drivers and did not give them the opportunity to thrive. “Bolt was taking 15 per cent before and Uber was taking 20 per cent. Now Uber is taking 25 per cent commission. Bolt is taking 20 per cent commission, without our prior notice,” Shonuga said. He asked the companies to deal with the association rather than individuals and demanded that driver partners be placed in every app company department. The drivers threatened to withdraw their services if the app companies refused to comply with their demands. Copyright PUNCH.
