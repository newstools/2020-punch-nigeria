Oladimeji Ramon The Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has urged judges in the state judiciary to ensure fairness in the adjudication of cases before them, pointing out that justice and fairness are the bedrock of societal development. Sanwo-Olu made the call on Monday at a church service to herald the 2020/2021 Legal Year of the Lagos State Judiciary. This was as the Chief Judge of Lagos State, Justice Kazeem Alogba, at a special Muslim service at the Central Mosque, Marina, pledged the commitment of the judiciary to effective justice administration that would boost public confidence. The governor was represented by his wife, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, at the church service, which held at the Cathedral Church of Christ, Marina, Lagos. Judges, magistrates and lawyers in the state were led to the church service by the Administrative Judge of the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja, Justice Grace Onyeabo. “Fairness and justice are the foundation of peace, stability, growth and development,” Sanwo-Olu said. In his sermon, the Diocesan Bishop of Lagos, Rt. Rev. Humphrey Olumakaiye, urged the judges to be strong and courageous and not allow their moral integrity to be compromised as they decide cases.
