Abiodun Nejo Thunderstorm allegedly struck 15 cows to death along Ikogosi Ekiti – Ipole Iloro Road on Friday night following a heavy rainfall. Owing to the development, fears of epidemic outbreak gripped the two communities, who appealed to the relevant government agencies at the local and state levels to tackle the development. The Asaoye of Ikogosi Ekiti, Chief Ayo Ademiluwa, who confirmed the development, said the sizes of the cows and the rains throughout Saturday made arrangement for the burial of the animals a difficult task. Ademiluwa said, “I appeal to responsible government agencies to come in urgently to the aid of the communities to avert epidemic. This is the tourism corridor of the state; we cannot afford the outbreak of any epidemic.” Copyright PUNCH.
