Kayode Oyero All Progressives Congress chieftains including former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; and former Osun State Governor, Chief Bisi Akande, on Saturday, arrived in Akure, the Ondo State capital, for the flag-off rally of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu re-election campaign. Akeredolu is seeking a return to office on the platform of the ruling APC in the election scheduled to hold on October 10, 2020. He has his deputy, Agboola Ajayi of the Zenith Labour Party; and Eyitayo Jegede of the Peoples Democratic Party as his main challengers in the election. The PUNCH had reported Friday that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), predicted an “easier clear victory” for Akeredolu. Buhari had also presented the party’s flag to Akeredolu at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. According to @OndoAPC on Twitter, Tinubu and Akande, who is APC ex-Interim National Chairman, alongside other party members, were received at the Akure Airport by the state governor on Saturday.
