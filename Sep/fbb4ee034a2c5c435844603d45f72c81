Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin Edo State Commissioner for Minerals, Oil, and Gas,  Joseph Ikpea, on Wednesday, resigned from the cabinet of Governor Godwin Obaseki just a few days to the September 19 governorship election in the state. Ikpea’s resignation, which was contained in a letter dated September 9, 2020, and addressed to the governor, was with immediate effect. The letter partly read, “Politics is all about interest, trust, and respect for one another, but I have never seen any of this till date, and I am also not sure of it even if I remain there till tomorrow. “Moreover, the party that is known today as APC was brought to Esan South East by me and over 90 per cent of my supporters are APC members till date.

Considering also that this administration didn’t recognise my leadership role.” The political climate in the state gets interesting as the September 19 poll approaches. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the state Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Paul Ohonbamu, resigned in June while state Commissioner for Environment and Sustainability, Omoua Oni-Okpaku, also resigned in July. Obaseki, who dumped the All Progressives Congress, is seeking re-election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. He has Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the candidate of the APC, as his major contender.
