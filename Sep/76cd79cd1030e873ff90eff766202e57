Wale Oyewale, Ibadan TRADITIONAL worshippers in Oyo State under the aegis of Traditional Religion Worshippers’ Association have urged Governor Seyi Makinde to adhere to his electoral promises by promoting equity within the state without discrimination against any religious faith. They made the call during a protest match over perceived discrimination against the traditional worshippers in the state at the Oyo State Secretariat, Agodi, Ibadan, on Tuesday. The General Secretary of the association, Dr Fayemi Fakayode, lamented the failure of the governor to keep his words to give equal recognition to all religious faith and to approve August 20 of every year (Isese Day) as a public holiday. Fakayode urged the Muslim community and the Christian Association of Nigeria and other stakeholders in Oyo State to support their demands in the spirit of religious equity to stop the discrimination, neglect and relegation of Yoruba traditional religions in the state. “We gathered to make our plight known to everybody in Oyo State. This is necessitated by the attitude of the Oyo State Government under the leadership of Engineer Seyi Makinde to the practitioners of Yoruba traditional religion in this state. The President-General, Isese Foundation and President, Oyo State Traditional Religions, Baale Olukanmi Egbelade, said, “We want the government to give us the recognition we deserve. There is freedom of religion. The Executive Assistant to the Governor on Security Matters, Mr. Sunday Odukoya, who received them, promised to pass their message to Governor Seyi Makinde.
