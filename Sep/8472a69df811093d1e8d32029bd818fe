Olufemi Olaniyi The National President of Soludero Hunters, Nureni Ajijolaanobi, has said the Oyo State Security Network Agency is not carrying the hunters along in the recruitment of prospective corps officials into the security outfit. Ajijolaanobi, who said this in an interview with our correspondent in Ibadan on Friday, said Soludero Hunters wzere ready to be part of Amotekun, adding that the group was sidelined by those carrying out the recruitment. He said the group had been working to defend Oyo State and the entire South-West even before Amotekun was established. He said the hunters would not stop their work even if they were sidelined. Ajijolaanobi said the efforts of the group were parts of what led to a drastic reduction of crimes in the Akinyele Local Government Area of the state. He said, “I heard the news on the radio and television and read it in newspapers that they have started recruiting for Amotekun. But I am surprised that they said some applicants registered claim to be our members. I can tell you that none of our members has registered. “If they bring forms to us, we will be part of it but if they don’t want us, it is okay by us. We enter forests to catch criminals and everybody knows this. The Commissioner of Police gave us money once because he saw our impact. “The President of Yoruba World Congress, Prof Banji Akintoye, gave us one SUV and two motorcycles for patrol. We are not doing this to make money but we want to rid our land of criminals.” Copyright PUNCH.
