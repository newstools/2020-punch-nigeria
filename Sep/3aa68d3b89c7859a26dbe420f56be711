LEKE BAIYEWU The House of Representatives has said the Nigeria Police Act Amendment Bill recently signed into law by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), is the first step towards reforming the Nigeria Police Force. Buhari had, in a memo, dated September 16, 2020, communicated his assent to the National Assembly. The House said the Act would address various issues facing effective and efficient policing of the country, including the protection of human rights. The House reacted to the presidential assent in a series of tweets via its Twìtter handle, @HouseNGR. The tweets read, “President @Mbuhari’s assent of the Nigeria Police Act 2020 is a welcome development. “On the 2nd July 2020, the 9th House of Representatives passed the Police Act, 2020. The Act seeks to provide for an efficient police service that will ensure accountability and transparency, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and ensure cooperation and partnerships between the police and communities in maintaining peace and combating crime. “The Act is the first step of a broader action towards wholesale reform of the Nigerian policing and national security infrastructure. Meanwhile, the sponsor of the amendment bill, Mr Yusuf Gagdi, said the Act would no doubt promote intense security in states across the federation. Copyright PUNCH.
