Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri Members of the House of Representatives have advocated improved funding for the North-East Development Commission to enable it to meet the development gaps and impact of Boko Haram crisis on the region. The Chairperson of the House of Representatives Committee on NEDC, Khadija Bukar-Abba, made the appeal during an oversight visit to the commission. Bukar-Abba, who led members of the committee to Maiduguri, Borno State capital, said given the enormity of humanitarian challenges in the zone, the commission required large funds to enable it to effectively discharge its duties. Speaking with journalists, she said, “The NEDC is grossly underfunded, and given the quantum of work that needs to be done, we strongly feel the commission should get more funding. “We have visited some of the internally displaced persons’ camps and had a first-hand experience of the depth of suffering the people are going through, especially women and children. Also speaking, the MD/CEO of NEDC, Mohammed Alkali, said funds released to the commission were used for the settlement, rehabilitation and reconstruction of roads, houses and business premises of the victims of insurgency, as well as tackling the menace of poverty, illiteracy level, ecological problems and any other related environmental or developmental challenges in the North-East states.
