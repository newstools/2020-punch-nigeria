Kelvin Ekerete Technical Director of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation, Damien Ohaike, says the federation is hopeful more athletes will qualify for the 2020 Olympics. Only Commonwealth and African Games gold medallist, Odunayo Adekuoroye, has booked a place at the multi-sports event in Tokyo next year. United World Wrestling confirmed March 12 to 14 as the new dates for the Africa and Oceania Olympic qualifiers set to hold in El Jadida, Morocco. “We know our athletes and we know where we want to lay emphasis on. We are currently monitoring them, asking them to keep fit,” Ohaike told The PUNCH. “We have a very strong line-up. We have Blessing Oborodudu, Aminat Adeniyi,  Emmanuel Nworie,  Mercy Genesis, and Ogbonna John, so I’m very confident that we can get more athletes to qualify.” Wrestlers who fail to book a qualifying slot in Morocco will have a final chance to secure a Tokyo 2020 berth at the World Olympic Games qualifiers scheduled to take place from April 29 to May 2 in Bulgaria.
