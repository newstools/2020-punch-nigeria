Samson Folarin The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has asked the management of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria to remodel facilities at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport. He said some of the facilities installed in the airport at inception were due for modernisation and upgrade. Sanwo-Olu also made a case for the provision of fast free Internet connectivity within lounges at the airport, adding that the era of passengers sitting for long without Internet access had passed. A statement on Tuesday said the governor spoke during a meeting with the FAAN management at Alausa, Ikeja, ahead of next Saturday’s re-opening of airspace for international flights. He said, “Travellers across the world are looking for destinations where things they enjoy in their comfort zones are provided. When we provide services and infrastructure that will drive traffic to our airport, not only will it triple the revenue generated for the government, it will also improve the status of the airport within the continent.” Sanwo-Olu said officials of the state government were working round the clock with the Federal Government to put safety protocols in place at the airport and drive compliance. The FAAN team, led by its Managing Director, Captain Rabiu Yadudu, asked the governor to assist in the provision of BRT buses to commute passengers from car park to departure and arrival halls, expansion of strategic airport roads, and halting of encroachment on the airport land around Ajao Estate and Shasha.
