Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Osun State Government on Sunday said it has commenced investigation into activities of Oroyemi Elizabeth Covenant Home and Care Centre in Ile-Ife, on the suspicion that the facility was being used as a baby factory. The Commissioner for Women, Children and Social Affairs, Mrs Bukola Olaboopo, said the ministry had shut down and evacuated the inhabitants of the orphanage. According to her, two of the adults evacuated from the facility were discovered to be lactating while they did not have babies with them. Olaboopo said the proprietor of the orphanage, Mrs Elizabeth Oroyemi, told officials of the ministry that she adopted the two women since they were young. She stated, “At the end of the day, we rescued 47 children, including about 10 to15 adult girls. Most of them were crying. They refused to follow us but we were able to take three of them with us. “The matron who is taking care of those adults just told me that it seems two of them are breastfeeding. When we interrogated them, they said they have never given birth. We want to know who get them impregnated when they were not married. “The proprietress claimed that they are orphans whom she brought up. How come they were pregnant? So there are so many things underneath and the state government is still investigating.” Copyright PUNCH.
