Kelvin Ekerete Basketball players and coaches are hopeful the recent N150m five-year deal between the Nigeria Basketball Federation and energy giants, Total E&P, will improve the standard of the country’s division one and two leagues. The deal between the NBBF and Total, which was officially signed on Tuesday in Lagos, will run from 2020 to 2025, with both divisions receiving N15m each annually to organise and run the leagues. “It’s a huge relief. The last time we played in the league, the players and the clubs shouldered the bulk of the responsibilities. It will also help in exposing players to the big leagues,” Titans basketball academy point guard, Nonso Nkwocha, told The PUNCH. Coach of 2019 Division 1 champions, Impression Academy, Asaba, Kenneth Mfon, says the sponsorship deal is a welcome development especially for grassroots sports. “I’m happy the NBBF has been able to improve the grassroots. The deal brings a lot of hope to players, coaches and teams playing grassroots basketball in the country,” Mfon said. “It will also expose these players to the bigger stage. The competition helps states pick good players for the National Sports Festival and the  country’s junior national teams.” Titans’ coach, Andre Achebe, stated, “It’s a welcome development for some of us who are in the lower divisions. The sponsors have done their part, so the administrators need to look for a way to make good use of the money. It will ensure the smooth running of the league and players will also become more exposed.” Copyright PUNCH.
