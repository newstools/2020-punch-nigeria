Protecting Lives is serious business. Ask anyone who has done it before. Don’t know anyone? No worries, Tangerine Life has you covered. We teamed up with Urbangidi, a media communications team in the heart of Lagos and went on the road to discuss with people who put themselves at risk every day; protecting lives. This is how we met our first security personnel: Isiaka. But before we share with you what we discovered, there is a vital question. Why? – Why is Tangerine Life interested in protecting lives. The answer is simple – This is what Tangerine Life does. When we announced our flagship product Tangerine Term Life insurance, we showed that we are a brand interested in protecting the lives of Nigerians through life insurance first, and then in other ways later. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, we have created a product that can give you the peace of mind you need to live life without fear.
