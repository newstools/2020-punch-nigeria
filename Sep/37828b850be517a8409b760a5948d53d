Joseph Olaoluwa The International Air Transport Association has urged the Canadian government to safely reopen Canada to international and domestic travel without the need for blanket quarantine measures. In a statement by the global body which represents 290 airlines, it asked Canada to support the COVID-19 testing initiatives of Air Canada and Westjet as international traffic to the North American nation had reduced since March. IATA’s Director General and CEO, Alexandre de Juniac, explained that there were other alternatives to quarantine measures used by Canada. He said, “There are alternatives to the quarantine measures currently in place that can both keep Canadians safe as well as revive the economy. The ICAO multi-layered approach (take-off guidance) is one. “The work that Air Canada and WestJet are doing on testing adds another dimension. It is critical that the government of Canada acts on these before the economic and social damages become permanent and the public health consequences of mass unemployment become even more apparent.” IATA estimated that revenues generated by airlines with service connecting and within Canada could fall by C$22.6bn, compared to 2019. This figure is a 70 per cent decline, according to the statement. This figure puts at risk nearly 410,500 Canadian jobs and some C$39bn of Canada’s Gross Domestic Product, which is generated by aviation directly and indirectly as well as by aviation-related tourism.
