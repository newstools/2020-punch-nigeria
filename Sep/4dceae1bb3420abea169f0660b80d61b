Chelsea new boys Hakim Ziyech and Ben Chilwell will miss the start of the Premier League season in a real blow to Frank Lampard, according to reports. The Blues have been ruthless in the summer transfer window – signing Ziyech (£37m), Chilwell (£50m), Timo Werner (£53m), Kai Havertz (£89m) while also
completing free transfers for Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr. However, according to The Athletic – Chelsea fans will have to wait to see both Ziyech and Chilwell in action after they are set to miss the start of the
campaign – in which they begin away at Brighton on Monday – due to injury. Ziyech twisted his knee during Chelsea’s friendly against Brighton 11 days ago, which forced him off in the 54th minute at the Amex Stadium. Chilwell is still struggling with a heel injury after signing from Leicester – he has been working his way back to full fitness after picking up the problem
against Crystal Palace on July 4. However, fellow new boy Havertz is on course to make his debut at the Amex Stadium on Monday evening as Lampard’s side look to get off to winning ways. Meanwhile, Chelsea have been given a big boost with Christian Pulisic also in line to feature after recovering from a hamstring injury suffered in the FA Cup
final defeat against London rivals Arsenal. After spending £230m in the summer window, the Blues will be desperate to get off to an emphatic start in the Premier League. Lampard will be looking to make quick inroads with both Manchester City and Liverpool, who have been the dominant forces over the last couple of seasons. Chelsea secured Champions League football on the final day of last season – finishing fourth, but a massive 33 points behind runaway winners Liverpool.
