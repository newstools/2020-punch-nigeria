Chima Azubuike, Gombe The United Nation says the decline in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria shows a collapse in testing, adding that it has nothing to do with the containment of the virus. The Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for the United Nations in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, called on state governments to hold institutions accountable in the containment of the virus. The coordinator, who was in Gombe on assessment of development projects, disclosed this on Tuesday while on a courtesy call to the Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya. Kallon also said he was disturbed by the controversies surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine. He said, “The COVID-19 pandemic will be with us for a long time until a vaccine is found and the more I listen to the politics of the vaccine production, the more I get worried. “The decline in the number of confirmed cases we hear about is indicative of low demand in testing and has nothing to do with containment of the virus with the ongoing community transmission. “I’m happy I am here with the scientists of the World Health Organisation, so whatever I say here is what they have told us is the fact about COVID-19.” The Governor of Gombe State, Inuwa Yahaya, while stating that his government would do its best in the containment of the virus, said there were more serious health challenges. He said, “Over 25 children were killed by malaria in Kwame Local Government Area last week. We need to put more attention on diseases that have been with us that needs to be addressed. But it can’t be done without proper control on sanitation and hygiene.” Copyright PUNCH.
