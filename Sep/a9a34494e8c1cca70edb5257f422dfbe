Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Sharia Court of Appeal in Kubwa, Abuja, on Tuesday, adjourned till September 16 for hearing the suit involving the custody of children between Atiku Abubakar, and his former wife, Maryam Sherif. Abubakar is the son of former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar. Sherif is seeking an order granting her custody of their three sons, a request opposed by Abubakar. The estranged parents were present in court with the children on Tuesday. Sherif had originally instituted the suit marked CV/41/2019 at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Gudu, but the case was later transferred to the Sharia Court of Appeal and marked CV/16/2020.

Sherif’s lawyer, Nasir Saidu, did not object to the request but asked that the press should be allowed to cover the proceedings in chambers. The judge, Bashir Dansule, granted the application to have the matter heard in chambers. He also granted permission to journalists to cover the proceedings but directed that they must protect the interest of the children. When the matter resumed in chambers, the defence lawyer urged the court to adjourn the matter to enable him to present his last witness, who he said had yet to return from a trip to Dubai. But Saidu opposed the request for adjournment on the grounds that it was a ploy to delay the matter. Abubakar’s lawyer, who maintained that the witness was outside the country, said he was not opposed to his witness testifying virtually. The judge, after hearing the two sides, adjourned the matter till September 16. He also agreed to hear the defence witness virtually if not physically present at the next sitting.
