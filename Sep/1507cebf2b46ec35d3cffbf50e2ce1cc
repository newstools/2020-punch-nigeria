Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe A self-acclaimed oil marketer, Olufemi Adesanya, has been sentenced to 21 years’ imprisonment for defrauding a United States of America-based businesswoman, Oluwatoyin Akinwole, of N37.6m. Adesanya was standing trial alongside one Awojobi Ganiu before Justice Mojisola Dada before Ganiu pleaded guilty to amended two counts of stealing and obtaining money by false pretences and was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment by the court. According to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the duo allegedly defrauded Akinwole, leaked her nude pictures on social media and falsely claimed that she committed suicide by jumping into the Third Mainland Bridge in 2017. During the trial, Akinwole in her evidence, said the duo defrauded her of N71m under the pretext of rendering special prayers for her and helping her to invest in a crude oil business. According to her, the defendants, after defrauding her, posted her nude pictures which they took from her phone on social media and falsely claimed that she committed suicide to deter her from coming after them and seeking justice. Akinwole said she found out about the scam when an employee of Adesanya called and informed her that the defendants never invested her money in any oil business, but rather used it to buy houses and cars. Adesanya was arraigned on four counts bordering on stealing and obtaining money by false pretences. Delivering her judgment on Monday, Justice Dada sentenced Adesanya to 14 years’ imprisonment on count one, another 14 years on count two, and seven years on count four. He was, however, discharged on count three. Justice Dada added that the sentence would run concurrently. Copyright PUNCH.
