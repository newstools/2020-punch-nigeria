Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Government in a bid to stem the menace of child sexual abuse has trained teachers across the state in the child protection policy. The state Commissioner of Education, Folasade Adefisayo, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the Lagos State Ministry of Education, Abosede Adelaja, in the online training, emphasised on the roles of teachers in reporting child sexual abuse to relevant authorities. She said, “This training is not only novel but right in time as cases of child sexual abuses have been rising during the period of the COVID-19 lockdown. The Lagos State Government, as well as the Ministry of Education, is committed to working with teachers and counsellors to ensure that child protection is effectively implemented in schools as child protection is fundamental to the development of every child.” The training facilitator, Cece Yara Foundation, took the teachers through the Lagos State Child Protection Policy and how to implement it. The Executive Director of the foundation, Grace Ketef, stated that the training would make the teachers know their roles as mandatory reporters of child sexual abuse. She said, “Give children confidence and assurance so they can confide in teachers. Have the child abuse contacts on your speed dial and record facts of the case as quickly as possible.” Copyright PUNCH.
