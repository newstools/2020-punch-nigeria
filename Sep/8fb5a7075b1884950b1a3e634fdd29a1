Tony Okafor, Awka The police in Anambra State have arrested a 41-year-old suspected ritual killer, Ogbonna Nwankwo, for attempting to cut off a woman’s breast in a motel in the Orumba South Local Government Area of the state. A source told our correspondent that the suspect attempted escape but was apprehended by youths in the area. “The mob beat him to a stupor before the police arrived and took him to a hospital for treatment,” the source added. A police spokesperson, Haruna Mohammed, who confirmed the incident, said the state Commissioner of Police, John Abang, had directed that the case be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department for discreet investigation in order to unravel the circumstances surrounding the incident. Mohammed said, “Around 8am, there was a report of an attempted murder of one Bella Joseph, 29, residing at Dollar Inn Motel, Ihite, in the Orumba South LGA of Anambra State by a lodger, Ogbonna Nwankwo, 41, of Ihite town, in the same LGA. “The suspect allegedly attempted to murder the lady inside the motel room by stabbing her with a knife in her stomach. He tried to cut off the right side of her breast, using the same knife, probably for a ritual purpose. He thought that she was dead before he was apprehended following her shout for help, which drew the attention of the motel manager. “Consequently, the scene was visited by police operatives attached to the Umunze division and the victim was rushed to a specialist hospital at Nnewi for treatment. “The suspect, who was seriously manhandled by an angry mob and beaten to stupor, was arrested by the police and taken to the hospital for treatment.” Mohammed said a bloodstained knife was recovered from the scene.
