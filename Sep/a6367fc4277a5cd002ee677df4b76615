When contacted, Odumosu said some arrests had been made, adding that investigation had commenced into the incident. “Three people were involved in the operation and from what I gathered when I visited the house today, only one of the suspects was armed. The suspects gained entry through the canal because the building backed the canal and I was told that some pieces of jewellery and money were stolen. I have beefed up security in the area. “None of the residents, including his wife, Bisi and two girls were attacked or injured during the operation. We have made some arrests and commenced an investigation into the incident,” Odumosu said.
