Temiloluwa O’Peters The Nigerian Institute of Building is embarking on a novel examination of some buildings constructed across the country about sixty years ago – before or around the time of Nigeria’s independence. The NIOB said in a statement issued on Saturday that it was undertaking the condition survey of the selected buildings in commemoration of Nigeria’s 60th independence anniversary. It said the output of the survey would be useful to policy makers, researchers, industry practitioners and members of the public interested in quality construction. The National President of the NIOB, Kunle Awobodu, explained that the survey was driven by the need to relate the lifespan of the examined buildings to the theoretical lifespan of buildings, especially the propounded approximately 60-year life span. He said another goal was to be able to relate the performance of the buildings to recently constructed ones or ones constructed much later after Nigeria’s independence. Awobodu further claimed that the condition survey would reveal the state of the buildings with respect to the components, functionality, performance and other parameters. “It would guide public discourse, challenge and probe current actions and guide in future projections,” he said. The condition survey is the NIOB’s contribution to the debate and search for standards and enduring construction, Awobodu said. Copyright PUNCH.
