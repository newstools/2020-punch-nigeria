Maiharaji Altine, Gusau The Zamfara State Government has employed 282 health workers from the money that was being paid to 93 ghost doctors in the state. The Chairman, Hospital Services Management Board, Alhaji Mustafa Anka said the ghost doctors were discovered by the board following an independent verification exercise. He stressed that, the sum of N23m was being stolen every month by some people in paying for 93 doctors who never existed. “I personally set up a committee to verify the exact number of doctors who were under the board and to my utmost dismay, 93 of them were ghost doctors. The sum of N23m was being paid as their salary monthly,” said Anka. Anka said Governor Bello Matawalle gave him the directive to employ additional health workers with the money. He said, We employed 282 health personnel, ranging from nurses, medical laboratory technicians, dental and health records technicians.” Copyright PUNCH.
