Chima Azubuike, Gombe GOMBE State Commissioner of Police, Shehu Maikudi, on Monday, paraded four human traffickers with 12 children. Maikudi said the arrest of the syndicate was done by the police with support from parents. According to Maikudi, “Some parents complained that their children were abducted. One of the suspects was arrested last week. Investigation took police to Anambra where they recovered two children. “The suspect we have in our custody today took to her heels since 2017; she has been on the run, changing locations, and in her custody, we found 12 children from various locations. “We can’t comfortably say they are all from Gombe. This breakthrough was done painstakingly by the combined team of the police and parents in conjunction with the state government because they provided all the logistics.” Also speaking, Hauwa Usman, an indigene of Gombe, was alleged to have sold more than 20 children to partners based in Anambra and Asaba. She said, “I sell female children for N250,000 and male children for N300,000. On her part, Nkechi Odiliye, who runs an orphanage in Anambra, said she in turn sold each of the children bought from Hauwa for N750,000 each. Copyright PUNCH.
