Joseph Olaoluwa The movement of containers by rail from the Lagos Port Complex, Apapa has been suspended for two months beginning from Tuesday, September 15. This was confirmed by the Lagos Railway District Manager of the Nigerian Railway Corporation, Jerry Oche, in a telephone interview with our correspondent. Oche explained that the development was to allow the contractor complete the laying of tracks along the standard gauge rail project. He also added that the narrow gauge would also undergo a few rehabilitation works. He said, “I am sure you are aware of the standard gauge track we are doing, the extension from Ebute Metta Junction to Apapa. “Now, the bulk of the work is EBJ to Apapa axis in terms of track while for the Lagos-Ibadan, the actual work is the station building.” The Railway boss noted that by the time the standard gauge was ready, both railway lines would be used to transport containers out of the port. In June, APM Terminals Apapa and the Nigerian Railway Corporation had restored rail connectivity for containers to the Apapa ports. Copyright PUNCH.
