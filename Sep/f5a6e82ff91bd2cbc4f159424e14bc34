Johnny Edward Ogenyi Onazi’s proposed move to Italian Serie A side, Crotone, is stalling due to his wage demands, The PUNCH has gathered. Crotone are eager to tie down the Nigeria international to a new three-year deal and have been locked in talks with the 26-year-old for days now. Pictures surfaced on the internet last week after Onazi passed his medical at the club, but our correspondent learnt that an agreement is far from being reached as the club aren’t willing to match his demands. It was gathered that Crotone are keen to structure his wages around performance-related bonuses, but Onazi feels he should be rewarded like the rest of his teammates. “The deal has not been wrapped up yet,” a source close to the midfielder told The PUNCH on the condition of anonymity. “They know what we want and it’s up to them to decide to meet our demands. We have some more days to agree on this.” Onazi is a free agent, after severing ties with Denizlispor in July. Copyright PUNCH.
