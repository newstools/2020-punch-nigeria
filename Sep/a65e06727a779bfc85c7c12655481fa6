Tunde Ajaja The Managing Consultant of CSDC Consulting Enterprise Solutions, the firm engaged by the Ondo State Government to drive its internally generated revenue, Mr Akinyele Oladeji, has said the state’s  IGR increased from N8,684,406,573.63 in 2016 to N30,135,881,918.26 in 2019. He gave the IGR for 2017 as N10,927,871,479.76, which increased to N24,788,059,725.53 in 2018. He noted that the state had an average monthly IGR of N723,700,547.75 (2016); N910,655,956.65 (2017); N2,065,671,643.79 (2018) and N2,511,323,493.19 in 2019. In a statement on Friday, Oladeji also said reports by the National Bureau of Statistics on IGR generated by states showed that Ondo State moved from 22nd in 2016 to 19th in 2017; 11th in 2018 and 11th in 2019. He said, “With the mandate to move the IGR from the monthly average of N700m to an average of N3bn, the leadership of the Ondo State Internal Revenue Service, with the support of the global revenue consultant, have been able to move the IGR from the monthly average of N723,700,547.75 in 2016 to a monthly average of N910,655,956.65 in 2017. “It then moved to a monthly average of N2,065,671,643.79 in 2018 and N2,511,323,493.19 monthly average in 2019. The visionary actions of the Governor of Ondo State, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, that have turned the fortunes of Ondo State around through the consistent upward move in IGR since 2017 can only be appreciated when compared to the previous downward trend in the State’s IGR.” He said the successes recorded in IGR were due to the revamping of the tax administration process and the introduction of technology to drive the process. “This process overhaul assisted in identifying the leakages and blocking them,” he added.
