Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin A fractional Speaker of the  Edo State House of Assembly, Victor Edolor has criticised the conduct of September 19 governorship election, saying election did not take place in the state. While urging the Independent National Electoral Commission to improve the conduct of future elections, he stated that the election was marred by rigging and bias for the Peoples Democratic Party. When asked whether his group would end the rift with Governor Godwin Obaseki , he retorted, “Which Governor. We will take a look at what happened and make our plans known to our supporters.” However, Frank Okiye, the leader of the seven members loyal to Obaseki, said the 14 members who stayed away from inauguration were no longer members of the House having failed to meet the required sitting. He called on INEC to organise bye elections to fill the vacant seats so that the constituencies could be represented in the House. “The case of the initial 14 has been settled. They are no longer members of the House and if not for the court action they instituted against the conduct of election to fill their seats, they would not be talking by now,” he added.
