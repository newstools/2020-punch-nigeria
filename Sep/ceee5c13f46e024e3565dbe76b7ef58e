Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin Chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State, have called on eligible voters to come out en masse without fear of intimidation and harassment to vote for the candidate of the PDP, Governor Godwin Obaseki. The chieftains, who spoke during a road show organised by leaders of Oredo Ward 2, urged the electorate to come out and exercise their franchise for the candidate of their choice. The Vice Chairman of Oredo Local Government Area, Belinda Ogiefa, said, “Come out and vote; don’t be afraid of any form of violence. This road show is meant to educate the masses that Governor Godwin Obaseki is no longer in All Progressives Congress, you should not be deceived. “We are pleading with you to come out and vote; there will not be any violence as the security agencies are going to ensure the protection of lives and property.” On his part, the PDP Zonal Secretary in Unit 8 and 9, Mr Lucky Edomen, promised to mobilise more voters to ensure the governor’s victory.
