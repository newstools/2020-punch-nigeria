Adeniyi Olugbemi The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has condoled with Senator Aliyu Wamakko over his daughter’s death. Tinubu was at Wamakko’s residence in Sokoto, alongside former governors of Kebbi and Nasarawa states, Adamu Aliero and Tanko Almakura. Speaking with journalists from the sidelines of the visit, Tinubu noted that the unity of the country was sacrosanct. He said, “Nobody chooses which tribe he or she comes from, not to talk of the family. It is by the wish of God that we all found ourselves where we are today. “I believe if we all live as one, we can always come together to develop our nation. I am a Yoruba man; I didn’t make myself a Yoruba, same thing goes for Igbo, Hausa or Fulani; so we must be united.” The former governor described the death of Sadiya Wamakko as not only painful to the father but also his associates. He prayed for her to continue to rest in peace, and for the fortitude for those she left behind to bear the loss. Also on the entourage of the former governor were former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Nuhu Ribadu, and Mallam Yusuf Ali. In his remarks, Wamakko praised Tinubu and his entourage. He described the death of his daughter as painful but an act of God which could not be questioned by anyone. Copyright PUNCH.
