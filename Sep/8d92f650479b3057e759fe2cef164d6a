Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has accused the ruling All Progressives Congress in the state of buying Permanent Voter Cards from commercial motorcycle operators” ahead of the October 10 governorship election in  the state. The allegation was contained in a statement issued by the state PDP Publicity Secretary, Mr Kennedy Peretei, in Akure on Tuesday. Peretei said, “The PDP in Ondo State, has it on good authority that the APC-led government is inviting commercial motorcycle operators in the state to the Government House to submit their PVCs in exchange for money. “We wish to remind the Motorcycle operators that such a development is only aimed at further impoverishing and denying them of their social responsibility.” However, the state Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mr Alex Kalejaiye, dismissed the allegation, saying the PDP had become jittery. He said “Our party does not need to collect PVCs ahead of the election. The jittery opposition had withdrawn from the race before it leads its unsuspecting supporters on an endless ego trip.” Copyright PUNCH.
