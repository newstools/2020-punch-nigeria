John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party has berated the presidency for allegedly denigrating the person of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and other leaders who spoke out about Nigeria’s dwindling fortunes under the current regime. National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, made the party’s position known in a statement titled, “State of the Nation: Listen to Voice of Reason, PDP Cautions Buhari…Berates Presidency For Insulting Obasanjo, Other Leaders”, in Abuja, late on Sunday. The PDP was responding to a statement signed by Presidential Spokesmen, Mallam Garba Shehu, in which Obasanjo was described as “Divider-in-Chief,” for his criticism of the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd.). Ologbondiyan said, “The Peoples Democratic Party has, for the umpteenth time, cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari to come down from his high horse and listen to the advice from eminent Nigerians, who are advising him against allowing our nation to tumble from the cliff under his watch. “The Buhari Presidency is worsening the sorry state in which it has plunged the nation by choosing to haul insults on Nigerians including former Presidents like Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and other well-meaning leaders, who are patriotically calling on his administration to end its divisive, suppressive and insensitive style of leadership that has ruined our nation. “From its reactions to patriotic counsel, it is clear that the Buhari Presidency has become bereft of the fundamentals of governance as well as overwhelmed by its own failures and burden of guilt for the disunity, bloodletting, and anguish that have enveloped our nation in the last five years. “It is incontrovertible that the Buhari administration is leading Nigeria into a failed state, where citizens are not guaranteed of their safety; cannot afford the basic necessities of life and where governance has been crippled by incompetence, unbridled nepotism, promotion of injustice, executive high handedness, abuse of human right, disobedience to court orders, brazen violation of constitutional provisions, acute corruption and violent muscling of elections.”
