John Alechenu, Abuja The Chairman, Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress, Mai Mala Buni, and his Kogi State counterpart, Yahaya Bello, held a closed door meeting with party’s governorship candidate in the just concluded Edo governorship election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, in Abuja, on Wednesday. Although details of the meeting which held at Buni’s private residence were still sketchy as at the time of filing this report, it was gathered that the two governors used the occasion to impress upon Ize-Iyamu, to accept the outcome of the polls and move on. Recall that on Monday, Buni, in a statement titled “Edo State Governorship Election: Victory for Democracy,” congratulated the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Godwin Obaseki, who won the election. He described the conduct of the election and its outcome as victory for Nigeria’s democracy. The statement read in part, “The September 19, 2020 Edo State Governorship election is over, the winner has been declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the person of the Mr. Godwin Obaseki, candidate of the People Democratic Party. “We hereby congratulate the winner of the election, the people of Edo State and all Nigerians. The peaceful conduct of the election and its outcome represent victory for Nigeria’s democracy.” Copyright PUNCH.
