Pep Guardiola said his squad is stretched to the limit as Manchester City prepare to launch their League Cup defense after Monday’s opening Premier League win against Wolves. City claimed an impressive 3-1 victory at Molineux on Monday as Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden, and Gabriel Jesus struck in their Premier League opener. They remain without Joao Cancelo, Bernardo Silva, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Sergio Aguero, Aymeric Laporte, and Eric Garcia while Ilkay Gundogan is self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus.

We have just three days. We won the Carabao (League) Cup three times in a row and we would like to continue but we don’t have the players in this period to play every three days.” (AFP)
