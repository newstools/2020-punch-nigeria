Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan The Oyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, has said those threatening to send him out of office in 2023 are not politically relevant. The governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, in a statement said Makinde spoke in Ogbomoso  on Wednesday when he started the second phase of the Light-Up Oyo Project, in the town and also  the construction of the three-kilometre-Under-G-LAUTECH road. The governor said even if he decided not to seek re-election, the state would not be governed by charlatans again. Makinde said, “Let me sound this: if I will not seek re-election, I am sure that Oyo State will never, again be in the hands of charlatans. “So, calm down. It is even too early to start talking about a second term. Some parties that do not have even one councilor are saying that they will send me out of the Government House in 2023.” Makinde said the second phase of the Light-Up Oyo Project was expected to be completed within nine months, noting that the first phase in Ibadan was already at 87.5 per cent completion. He  said the Light-Up Oyo Project was important to the economic expansion and security enhancement agenda of his administration. Copyright PUNCH.
