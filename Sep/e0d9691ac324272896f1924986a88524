Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta Acouple and two others have been arrested by men of the Ogun State Police Command for being in possession of a suspected human skull. The couple, Niyi and Remilekun Folorunso, were arrested alongside one Muyideen Tolubi and a herbalist, Sonubi Taiwo, after they allegedly severed the head of a corpse. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Monday. Oyeyemi said the four suspects were arrested last Thursday following information received by the police that the suspects were digging a grave in Odogbolu. He said, “Upon receiving the information, the DPO Odogbolu division, CSP Afolabi Yusuf, led his detectives to the scene; but the suspects had already removed the head of the corpse and left. “The police then embarked on an intelligence-based investigation, which led to the arrest of the couple, Niyi and Remilekun Folorunso, as well as Muyideen Tolubi. “The three of them confessed to being the persons that dug the grave and removed the head of the corpse. “They later took detectives to Ikenne, where the fourth person who asked them to bring the head for a ritual purpose was apprehended.” Oyeyemi said the state Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, had ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation and prosecution.
