The effect of the COVID- 19 on air travel will cost Nigeria and other Africa’s economies 3.5 million aviation jobs, triggering a contraction of continental Gross Domestic Product by $35bn in 2020, The International Air Transport Association stated that until the pandemic outbreak, aviation’s contribution to African labour force and the GDP topped 6.2 million jobs and $56bn. In its commentary on aviation business in Africa and the Middle East, IATA noted that air traffic in Africa and the Middle East witnessed the most fall of all regions in July relative to 2019 levels with passenger traffic crashing by as much as 93.7 per cent year on year. It, however, recommended that testing be adopted in place of widespread quarantine measures as the two regions reopened their economies in order to revitalise aviation operations. Copyright PUNCH.
