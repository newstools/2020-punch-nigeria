Peter Dada, Akure The seven lawmakers who opposed the impeachment of the state Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, in the state House of Assembly have knocked the state governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, for excluding them from the cars given to the lawmakers. Akeredolu,  distributed the 2020 model SUV KIA Sportage to 19 out of the 26 members of the state Assembly as official vehicles last Friday. According to the governor, his administration had kept its promise of providing the cars to the lawmakers despite the dwindling resources of the state. However, one of the aggrieved lawmakers and deputy speaker of the Assembly, Mr Iroju Ogundeji, condemned the action of the governor against the seven legislators, saying they were denied the cars because they did not support the impeachment. He said, “They are using their power on us because we did not support the impeachment but I know the time shall pass. They even refused to obey the court that dismissed our suspension. Similarly, another lawmaker, Tomide Akinribido, said their exclusion was to penalise them for their refusal to sign the impeachment notice against the deputy governor. “It is not the governor’s personal gifts, this is statutory and the governor should not play politics with it,” Akinribido said.
