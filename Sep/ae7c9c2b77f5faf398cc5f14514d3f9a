One person died, while four others sustained injuries on Thursday in an accident involving two trucks at Ayetoro, on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Mowe-Ibafo Divisional Commander of the Ogun Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps, Mr. Ojuoro Olusola, confirmed the accident to the News Agency of Nigeria in Ota, Ogun State. Olusola said the accident, which happened at about 6.10 a.m. at Ayetoro in-bound Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, was caused by “reckless driving.” He said two vehicles, a Mack mini truck marked ABC 720 XG loaded with banana; and a Volvo truck, marked LSR 492 XK, were involved in the accident that led to the death of a man, while four others sustained varying degrees of injuries. Quoting an eye witness, Olusola said the Volvo truck drove against the traffic and collided with the incoming Mack truck loaded with banana. “The corpse of the victim has been deposited at a private morgue in Sagamu town, while the survivors were taken to Famobis Hospital, Lotto, Ogun State, for intensive care,’’ the commander said. Olusola said the two trucks had been taken to the Police cage through the assistance of FRSC and other sister agencies to ease the free flow of traffic on the axis. He admonished motorists to avoid driving against traffic and other activities that could lead to accidents. (NAN)
