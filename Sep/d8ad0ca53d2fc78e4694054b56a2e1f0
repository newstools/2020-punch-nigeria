Peter Dada, Akure The media adviser to the Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Mr. Tope Okeowo on Tuesday denied reports that his principal, Agboola Ajayi, said he was not interested in votes from Ijaw people in the Ese Odo Local Government Area of the state. Ajayi is the candidate of the Zenith Labour Party in the October 10 governorship election. The ZLP candidate was quoted in the media to have told leaders of the Arogbo Ijaw community at a meeting that he did not require their votes to become governor. However, the candidate’s aide said “The report was a lie from the pit of hell. Right now (Tuesday) as I am speaking with you, the deputy governor is with the monarch of Arogbo Ijaw and the campaign is currently going on in the local government. He was welcome by his people. The report is a sponsored one and we know where it came from.” Copyright PUNCH.
