Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin A former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, on Wednesday night, has said though life is not all about winning, he won’t give up on Nigeria’s democracy. The former labour leader, who spoke for the first time on the outcome of the last Saturday governorship election in Edo State, which his party lost to the Peoples Democratic Party, said losing was also part of life. In a video on Tuesday, the former governor of Edo State was also philosophical as he posited that life is about winning some and losing some. Oshiomhole explained that he will not give up on strengthening democracy in the country, reiterating that many voters were frustrated by faulty card readers during the Edo election. He added that he was inspired by the determination of the aged and nursing mothers who endured the harsh weather to cast their votes, saying “If septuagenarians were not frustrated because their card readers are not working, it inspired me that if at their age they don’t give up, why should I give up? “And I ask our people to have faith in our country because we are not going to have another one. This is our country and we must make it great. We must strengthen democracy, we must improve on it. No matter the outcome of an election, or a particular edition of a process, have faith in God and have faith in our country.” Oshiomhole said contrary to the thinking that he would be down by the outcome of the election, he remains strong and healthy. He added, “In life, you work hard and leave the outcome to God. You do your best and trust God to bless your efforts. I feel good, I feel strong, thank God. In life, you win some and you lose some but life goes on “A lot of people will be thinking now that Comrade must be down, but I am not down. When God says you are not down, you are not down and I am not down.”
