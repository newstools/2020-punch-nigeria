NNPC said in a statement issued by is spokesperson, Kennie Obateru, that the prepayment financing was backed by future oil production of NPDC. The corporation said the financing utilises a well-established structure to enable the purchaser of the crude, Eagle Export Funding Limited, to raise financing in the domestic and international markets, to fund an upfront payment to NNPC under a Forward Sale Agreement.
