Friday Olokor The Independent National Electoral Commission on Saturday said it was committed to following through its processes and procedures for the governorship election in Edo State. The commission was reacting to allegations by the Peoples Democratic Party of plots by agents of the All Progressives Congress to replace election results where the PDP was leading, particularly in the Edo North. But INEC National Commissioner and chairman (Information and Voter Education Committee), Festus Okoye, said although there were challenges posed by poor network in some of its communities, “our Registration Area Technical Assistants are working hard at overcoming the challenges.” He said, “The commission is irrevocably committed to following through its processes and procedures. As of 18.49pm, 702 results have been uploaded in the INEC Result Viewing Portal. “Our Presiding Officers are uploading Form EC8A which is the Polling Unit Result. Presiding Officers must complete Form EC 60E (The People’s Result Sheet) and past at the Polling Unit. “We understand the challenges posed by poor network in some of our communities and our Registration Area Technical Assistants are working hard at overcoming the challenges. ‘‘The commission is focused on completing the process. The commission is not interested in the outcome but focused on the processes and procedures.” Copyright PUNCH.
