Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin A middle-aged man, whose daughter was allegedly raped on Edobor Street, Uwelu Quarters in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State, has alleged that the suspect, Destiny Obiyan, lured his six-years-old daughter with rice and egg to defile her. The father of the girl, Okehelem Oyenma, made the allegation in Benin during a protest march to the secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Edo State Council. Oyenma said, “He took my daughter through the backyard to his own house, bought her rice and egg. My daughter told me that after feeding her, he pulled down her pants and after that, he inserted his penis. “After that, my daughter started bleeding seriously. So, because of the curfew, the vigilance group assisted me and my wife to look for my daughter that night and not knowing that she was with this Destiny Obiyan in his house. “The following day, I asked her to take her mother to the rapist’s house while I went to the Textile Mill Police Station to lodge a complaint. When myself and the police got to the Obiyan’s house, we met him and his native doctor with his charms inside his palour. The police arrested the boy and the native doctor.” He called on the police to investigate and ensure justice was done in the matter.
