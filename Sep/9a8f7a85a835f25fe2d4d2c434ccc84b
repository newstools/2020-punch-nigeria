It added that this was in line with its culture as timeless wealth partners, which would impact positively on the nation’s socio-economic development. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the bank, Ifie Sekibo stated that Heritage Bank was mindful of the devastating impact of the pandemic to the nation’s economic system. “We will up our game to empower Nigerian youths who are one of the bedrock of any vibrant economy,” he stated. He disclosed that one of the channels in partnering the youths to leverage their talents and contribute their quota to the growth of the economy, was the use of financial inclusion strategy which would be adopted to boost entrepreneurship development. This, he said, was critical to Heritage Bank’s mission to create, preserve and transfer wealth across generations. He explained that Heritage Bank’s various entrepreneur schemes in the support for business had always focused on dependable job-creating sectors, such as agricultural value chain (fish farming, poultry, snail farming), cottage industry, mining and solid minerals, creative industry (tourism, arts and crafts), and Information and Communications Technology.
