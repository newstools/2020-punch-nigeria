Peter Dada, Akure Ahead of the October 10 Ondo State Governorship Election, a former Secretary to the State Government, Ifedayo Abegunde, has reunited with the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. Abegunde, who was appointed SSG by the Akeredolu at the early stage of the current administration, fell out with the governor shortly before the APC primary. He resigned from the position while accusing the governor of ill-treatment. Shortly after his resignation, Abegunde joined the campaign of one of the APC aspirants, Segun Abraham, who lost to Akeredolu and subsequently declared support for the governor. It was gathered that the party leaders reconciled the former SSG with his estranged boss at a meeting held at the Government House in Akure, the state capital, on Sunday. The state Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo, who confirmed the development, said, “The former SSG never said he was leaving APC even when he resigned his position. The return to his leader, the governor of the state, shows how deep in thoughts and altruistic he is. It also shows how magnanimous and kind-hearted the governor is. This is a rare display of fatherly compassion by the governor and uncommon courage by the former SSG.”
