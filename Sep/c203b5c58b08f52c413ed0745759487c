Johnny Edward Victor Osimhen scored his second hat-trick in as many games for Napoli on Friday in their 4-0 win over Italian third division side, Teramo, Saturday PUNCH reports. The treble took his tally to six in two pre-season friendlies since he completed his €80m move  from Lille last month. The 21-year-old had grabbed a debut hat-trick for the Partenopei last week as Napoli thrashed L’Aquila 11-0 in a friendly. The Nigeria international underlined why Napoli made him their most expensive player of all time when he fired Napoli into an early lead after just four minutes. Hirving Lozano doubled Napoli’s lead, before Osimhen scored a second-half brace in four minutes to seal an emphatic win for Gennaro Gattuso’s side. He was substituted in the 75th minute for Fernando Llorente. Osimhen is expected to make his first Serie A appearance against Parma on September 20 after the Italian league fixture for the 2020/21 season was released on Wednesday. Copyright PUNCH.
