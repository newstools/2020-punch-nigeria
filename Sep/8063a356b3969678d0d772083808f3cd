Dayo Ojerinde The Head of Voluntary Blood Donation Unit, Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, Mrs Mercy Onofomi, has said a lot of people are ignorant of the benefits of blood donation. Onofomi said this on the sidelines of a blood donation exercise organised by the Sound Alliance Foundation in partnership with the Department of Haematology and Blood Transfusion Unit, LUTH. She said, “Many people tell you they don’t have enough blood in their system and that is why they won’t go for blood donation. Some will even ask you how much they will get in return for donating blood. “A lot of people are having excess blood, yet they will tell you don’t have enough blood in their system. To me, this is ignorance; people don’t know the importance of blood donation; donating blood helps to save lives, it makes an individual to feel refreshed. “Those who are not regular blood donor, their bone marrow will turn to green as they grow older; the bone marrow of regular donors remains the same as they age.” The Coordinator, Sound Alliance Foundation, Dr Samuel Okerinde, said the event was organised to raise the awareness on blood donation. He said, “The best gift you can give someone is what can save lives; we don’t have that culture of voluntary blood donation in Nigeria. We need to raise more awareness on it.” Copyright PUNCH.
