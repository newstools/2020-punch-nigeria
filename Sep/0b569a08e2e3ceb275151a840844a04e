Adebayo Folorunsho-Francis The Nigerian Institute of Medical Research in Lagos says it has developed molecular test kit for COVID-19. The research institute says the test kit is known as the SARS CoV-2 Isothermal Molecular Assay, SIMA. The test kit is for COVID-19 detection, according to the institute’s Director-General, Prof. Babatunde Salako. Salako told PUNCH Healthwise on Friday that the innovation was borne out of the global sample testing challenges experienced by scientists and physicians. Speaking on the importance of the test kit in the fight against the global pandemic, Salako said, “While no effective vaccine has been developed to date, case detection remains the surest way of controlling the pandemic. “Molecular laboratories remain limited in number, and people living in remote areas are at a disadvantage when it comes to getting tested. “Testing centres are also limited and mostly available in urban areas. The molecular test kits are, therefore, one sure way to confirm the presence or otherwise of the virus in a population.” Copyright PUNCH.
