John Alechenu, Abuja THE Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, has said any electoral victory obtained through means other than the legitimate votes of the people was nothing short of a coup d’état. Tambuwal said the Edo State governorship election scheduled to hold on Saturday as well as the Ondo State governorship election scheduled for October 10, were test cases of our preparedness for rule-based and consent-enabled governance. He said this in a statement titled, ‘Tambuwal: Rigging is coup d’état,’ which he signed and issued to commemorate the 2020 edition of United Nations International Day of Democracy, on Tuesday. Tambuwal, who is also the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party Governors’ Forum, said, “It has become imperative to rethink the role of not just the electoral umpire, but also the activities of various security agencies in our electrical process in such a manner as to instill in them the culture of inflexible support for democracy and its practice. “Any electoral victory obtained other than through the legitimate votes of the people is nothing short of a coup d’etat.” He stressed that that governmental authority must be obtained only through the will of the people, even as he appealed to the National Assembly to immediately conclude the long overdue amendments to the Electoral Act.
