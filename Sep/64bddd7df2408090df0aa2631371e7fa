Joseph Olaoluwa The Accident Investigation Bureau Commissioner, Akin Olateru, has sought presidential assent for a bill to empower the bureau to investigate rail, road, and marine accidents and serious incidents. Olateru noted that the bill was currently before the Senate for second reading while at the House of Representatives, a public hearing is being awaited. He said, “It (investigating accidents on different fronts) will all start once the bill is approved by the National Assembly and the President. After that is when we can be effective in that regard. Currently, we are set up to investigate air accidents and there is a proposal before the National Assembly. “In the House of Reps, it has passed second reading, we are waiting for public hearing on the new AIB bill. In the Senate, we are waiting for second reading and public hearing. Thereafter, it will transferred to the President for approval.” He stressed that the AIB had been investigating for safety, not for liability. Copyright PUNCH.
