Kayode Oyero The Federal Government says the National Youth Service Corps should start making preparations to reopen its orientation camps nationwide. Orientation camps across the country had been shut in March as part of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease. But speaking on Thursday, the National Coordinator of the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19, Dr Sani Aliyu, during a briefing at the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja, said the task force was in the process of developing “strict guidelines” to forestall the outbreak of infections when NYSC camps reopen. Aliyu said, “For the National Youth Service Corps, the NYSC is to consolidate on safety measures currently being put in place and start preparing for the reopening of orientation camps when educational institutions open.
