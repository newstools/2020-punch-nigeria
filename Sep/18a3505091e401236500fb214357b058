Wale Oyewale, Ibadan Prominent lawyer, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), has stressed the need for governments at all levels in the country and other stakeholders not to forget the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic. Olanipekun spoke during the unveiling of Prof. Timothy Adeboayo as the new Vice-Chancellor of Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo in Oyo State, on Wednesday. Olanipekun, who is the Pro-Chancellor of ACU, lamented that while Ajayi Crowther University and other private universities in the country kept engaging their students during the lockdown period, public higher institutions were shut down as a result of lack of logistics and vibrant ICT platforms to continue teaching. He said, “Now, the Federal Government should learn, the state government should learn and Nigeria as a country should also learn that COVID-19 has come. We pray that it shall not come to stay but again, nobody can foretell what tomorrow has in stock. “The major lesson from COVID-19 in terms of education is that we have to key into e-learning. In this university, throughout, our students were not physically on the campus but we never stopped teaching for one day.” In his remarks, the outgoing VC, Prof. Dapo Asaju, said, “Nigerian leaders are hopeless as of now, they have no idea, they have no ideology. They just occupy space and they are busy stealing. “But in the Nigeria education sector, I think we have made some giant strides and we can definitely do better.” Copyright PUNCH.
