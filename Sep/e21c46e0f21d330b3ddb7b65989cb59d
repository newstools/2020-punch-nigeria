Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja About 80 per cent of the 10,000 petroleum tankers used for transporting products nationwide lack critical safety features needed for the safe transportation of such commodities by road, the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria said on Thursday. MOMAN’s Chairman, Adetunji Oyebanji, disclosed this in Abuja at the ‘Truck Renewal Workshop’ organised by MOMAN and Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners. He said MOMAN was in talks with NARTO on the need for fleet renewal, adding this would lead to the replacement of unsafe trucks in the fleet of transporters. Oyebanji said, “With about 10,000 trucks involved all over the country hauling products majorly from the South to the North, about 80 per cent of these trucks do not have anti-skid. “They don’t have anti-rollover, anti-spill protection, automatic braking systems, onboard cameras and onboard tracking system required for safe transportation of petroleum products by road.” The MOMAN chairman said pipelines remained the most effective and efficient means of transporting petroleum products, but stated that the idea of a truck renewal plan was not novel to Nigeria.

This came as Corps Marshall, Federal Road Safety Corps, Boboye Oyeyemi, said the FRSC was set to begin the enforcement of ‘no-safety-vale-no-loading policy’. He said the policy would address the alarming cases of killings on the roads caused by tankers and trucks. In her remarks, Minister of State for Transportation, Gbemisola Saraki, who was represented by the Assistant Director, Mass Transit Administration, Angela Keyede, said most road accidents were caused by human errors, adding that such accidents could be avoided if drivers were disciplined enough while on roads.
