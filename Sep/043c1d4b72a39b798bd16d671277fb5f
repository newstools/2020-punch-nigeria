Operating income also grew by 7.7 per cent to N197.1bn from N182.9bn, while profit before tax fell to N57.1bn from N70.3bn in 2019, yielding a 14.4 per cent annualised return on average equity. The bank’s shareholders’ funds remained strong at N634.7bn, up from N597.9bn in December 2019, driven by growth in retained earnings. The Board of Directors of UBA declared an interim dividend of N0.17 per share for every ordinary share of N0.50 each held by its shareholders. Commenting on the results, UBA’s Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr Kennedy Uzoka, said “Our 2020H1 results is yet another demonstration of the resilience of our business model in an extremely uncertain and tough operating environment. “We recorded commendable growth in our underlying business in terms of customer acquisition, transaction volumes and balance sheet whilst inflation, depressed yield environment and exchange rate volatilities impacted our net earnings as anticipated.” Copyright PUNCH.
