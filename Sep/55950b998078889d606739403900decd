Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, has said that the ministry is working on law to make it illegal to export minerals without adding value to them. The minister said that Nigeria could not afford to repeat the mistakes it made in the oil and gas sector in the mining industry by exporting raw ore. He said on Monday that minerals mined across the country should be processed before being exported. The minister said this in a statement issued by an official of his ministry, Idowu Jokpeyibo, on behalf of the ministryâ€™s Director of Press. Adegbite said his ministry was currently working a downstream policy that would make exportation of raw ore illegal. Copyright PUNCH.
