Dayo Ojerinde A consultant obstetrics and gynaecology, Prof. Rotimi Jaiyesimi, has said it is wrong to say the country has reached the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. Jaiyesimi, at a virtual media roundtable discussion organised by the Nigerian Academy of Science on Thursday said Nigeria was far from flattening the COVID-19 curve. He spoke on the topic, ‘COVID-19 in Nigeria: Knowing the Myths and Facts.’ “Having the virus does not mean you will have severe disease. The numbers of people who end up having severe cases are those with co-morbidities. “Nigeria has not reached the peak of the disease and far from flattening the curve. There is the need to dispel the myths and misinformation,” Jaiyesimi said. Also, a professor of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Pharmacokinetics, Chinedum Babalola, while speaking on the topic, ‘Known Local Remedies that may be Useful for COVID-19 and the Need for More Research,’ said there are some bioactive compounds in plants used as spices, vegetables and fruits that could boost the immune system against COVID-19.
