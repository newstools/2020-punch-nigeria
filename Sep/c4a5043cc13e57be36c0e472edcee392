Johnson Okafor European shares retreated on Thursday with technology stocks leading losses in tandem with their US peers, while a swathe of middling local economic data fuelled bets on continued easy monetary policy. The pan-European STOXX 600 index shed 1.4 per cent after gaining as much as 1.3 per cent earlier in the day, as the technology sector .SX8P plummeted 3.8 per cent  from a 19-year closing high. According to Reuters News, the losses came in line with a 3.8 per cent drop in Wall Street’s tech-heavy Nasdaq index .IXIC, triggered by high valuations and U.S. jobless claims suggesting a stalling in the country’s labour market. Technology has marked the speediest recovery among its peers from pandemic lows but has also been seen as long overdue for some capitulation of gains. Weak local retail sales and service sector data earlier in the day augured an uneven economic recovery. But markets clung to the prospect of continued liquidity measures, after a particularly dismal inflation reading earlier in the week. The European Central Bank is expected to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in keeping monetary policy easy. Copyright PUNCH.
