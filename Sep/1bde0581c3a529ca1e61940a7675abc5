Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The All Progressives Congress in Edo State has called for the withdrawal of arms and ammunitions which were allegedly imported into Edo State from Rivers and Delta states during the governorship elections. The Chairman of the Edo State APC Media Campaign Council, Mr John Mayaki, in a statement, also called on the international community to prevail on leaders of the Peoples Democratic to retrieve all the illegal arms “imported into the state and deposited in the hands of hooligans.” He said, “They armed several thugs and engaged in many abductions during the period. Now the election is over, what has happened to the arms. “Now we fear that kidnapping, robbery among others will increase. Meanwhile, we ask  for the release the APC members kidnapped during the election. There is no gain in keeping them any longer, is there?” Meanwhile, Edo PDP, through its Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, asked Mayaki and other members of APC to stop crying like babies over their defeat. Nehikhare said: “All the flashpoints during the September 19 governorship election in Edo State involved APC and its thugs, but members of PDP adequately protected their votes, leading to the well-deserved victory by Governor Obaseki and his deputy, Philip Shaibu. “APC leaders should withdraw the guns and ammunition that they gave to their thugs, who are advised to make themselves available for training and empowerment programmes of Obaseki’s administration, in order to become useful members of the society, rather than later going into criminal activities with the arms and ammunition in their possession.” Copyright PUNCH.
