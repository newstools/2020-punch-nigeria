Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Chairman of the faction of the Ekiti State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party loyal to former Governor Ayodele Fayose, Mr Bisi Kolawole, said, on Monday, that the party would for now refrain from suspending members. He said the PDP is now more focused on reconciling aggrieved members in order to expand its membership base. Kolawole said his agenda was to unite the party and with that, reposition it to win the 2022 governorship poll in the interest of Ekiti people. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘It is bye-bye to APC in Ekiti come 2022 – PDP Chairman’, signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Bola Agboola, in Ado Ekiti. Kolawole was quoted as saying, “We are not going to suspend any member unless such member proves beyond every reasonable doubt that he or she is against the success of the PDP. “The PDP in Ekiti State had been polarised over leadership crisis between a group loyal to Fayose and another loyal to Senator Biodun Olujimi, which has resulted in parallel congresses at the ward, local government and state levels. “We’ll do everything possible to assuage the feelings of genuinely aggrieved members and make everybody comfortable under the leadership of Bisi Kolawole. The State Working Committee will ensure all tendencies in the party are brought together to achieve success. “The spirit, as I speak, is to bring people into the party; not suspend members, unless you are determined to leave the party, we are not willing to send you out of the party. I don’t belong to that school of thought for now.”
