Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Friday, inaugurated the 47.7 km Zaki-Biam-Afia/Gbeji Road estimated at N3.8b in the Ukum Local Government Area of the state. Ortom was on an inspection tour of projects undertaken by his administration within the Sankera axis of Benue North-East Senatorial District of the state. He had earlier inaugurated the renovated Central Primary School and Mbaton -Amaafu electricity projects in Katsina-Ala Local Government Area. The governor said the Zaki-Biam-Afia/Gbeji Road would boost the socio-economic wellbeing of the entire people of Ukum, Logo and Katsina-Ala LGAs. He said, “For me, there was no need to waste money for the commissioning of projects but since I have been accused of not executing any projects, I have decided to go round the state and commission them. I have many completed projects. “Our aim is for the primary schools, which is the basic foundation for learning, to be the strongest sector in the education sector.” Ortom said that his administration had approved another round of amnesty to the youths in Ukum, Logo and Katsina-Ala LGAs.
