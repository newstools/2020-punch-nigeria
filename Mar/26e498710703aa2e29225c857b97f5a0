John Ameh, Abuja The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and the President of Guinea Bissau, Umaro Sissoco Embalo, met in Abuja on Friday. He was on a ‘thank you’ visit to Buhari at the State House, arriving at 10.45 am for the meeting scheduled for 11 am. Sissoco Embalo emerged winner of a disputed presidential election after the second round of polling in January. His country’s electoral umpire said the 47-year-old defeated his rival, Domingos Simoes Pereira, by scoring 54 percent of the ballots. His opponent polled 46 percent but the rejection of the results by the loser created political tension in the West African country. Sissoco Embalo, who spoke to State House Correspondents, said he came to thank Buhari for the solidarity Nigeria showed to Guinea Bissau during the trying times of the aftermath of the presidential election. He said, “Nigeria has an important role to play in the African continent.  That’s why I will always come to Nigeria. Nigeria has shown solidarity in the most difficult periods of our country. “We are aware that Nigeria is a reference for democracy in the whole world. You have always shown that democratic choice is the best way to resolve things. “It is the people who make the choice. This is why I am here today to reaffirm the solidarity of the people of Nigeria towards us.”
