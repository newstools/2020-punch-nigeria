Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt The Rivers State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Felix Obuah, has charged returning/electoral officers for the party’s local government area congress across the 23 LGAs of the state to ensure that the exercise was free, fair and credible. Obuah said this while handing over sensitive electoral materials to the electoral officers on Wednesday at the state PDP secretariat in Port Harcourt. He said it was necessary to give every delegate the chance to exercise their voting rights. While stressing that nobody must be disenfranchised, the state PDP chairman added that those who bought forms to contest the elections must be allowed to vie for positions. He said, “All the people that have been screened and cleared must be allowed to contest the election.  All elections must take place at the respective local government headquarters and the party will not take it kindly with any attempts to subvert the process.” Restating that internal democracy had come to stay in the PDP, Obuah urged the returning officers to conduct a successful election and retain the confidence reposed in the party by Rivers people.
