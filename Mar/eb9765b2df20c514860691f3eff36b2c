John Ameh, Abuja Bayelsa State Governor, Diri Douye, on Tuesday, said he visited the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to formally present himself to him. Douye explained that, since assuming office as governor on February 14 Tuesday (yesterday) was the first time he visited the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He told State House Correspondents after the meeting, which ended about 1.39pm, that he told Buhari he was ready to work with the Federal Government in the interest of peace in the state. Recall that Douye became Bayelsa state governor, following the February 13 judgment of the Supreme Court, which sacked then All Progressives Congress governor-elect, Mr David Lyon, just 24 hours to his inauguration. The governor said, “Since I assumed office as governor of Bayelsa State, I have not come to see the father of the nation. Today, I just did that; to come and see the father of our country and to work with the Federal Government of Nigeria in ensuring peace and stability in my state and ensuring the development of my state. That is what informed my visit to Mr President today.” Copyright PUNCH.
