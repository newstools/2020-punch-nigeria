Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi Mitsubishi Motors has officially welcomed an ex-BBNaija housemate, Mike Edwards, as its new brand ambassador. Edwards was presented an Eclipse Cross at the ‘Role Swap Day’ which took place at the company’s showroom in Lagos. The ‘Role Swap Day’ is an initiative, which involves members of the company’s management team taking up roles of subordinates to enable them to further understand other departments within the organisation. As part of the exercise, Edwards was assigned to the workshop where he was tasked with servicing cars and changing tyres alongside other mechanics at the workshop. According to a statement on Tuesday, the Managing Director/Country Delegate, CFAO Nigeria, Mr Thomas Pelletier, while handing Edwards the key to his brand new car said, “We will like to officially welcome you to the Mitsubishi family and we are counting on you to inspire ambitious Nigerian youths. “We are very excited to share this year’s edition of the ‘Role Swap Day’ with you and we look forward to a great partnership with you on the team.” According to him, Massilia Motors is a joint venture of CFAO and Chanrai Group, the sole distributor of Mitsubishi Motors in Nigeria. Pelletier said the firm was focused on “delivering a range of exquisite cars such as Mitsubishi ASX, Eclipse Cross, Outlander, Pajero, Pajero Sport and the award winning L200 pick-up – to the Nigerian market.” Speaking on his role as brand ambassador, Edwards expressed his excitement to be part of the Mitsubishi family, adding that he looked forward to inspiring other young Nigerians to drive their ambitious vehicles.
