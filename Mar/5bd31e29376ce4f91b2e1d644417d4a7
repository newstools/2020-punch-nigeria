Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics on Thursday gave the Federal Government 15 days ultimatum for it to honour all pending agreements reached with it or risk industrial action. Addressing the press after the union’s 97th National Executive Committee meeting at the Federal Polytechnic, Ede, Osun State, ASUP President, Anderson Ezeibe, said members would embark on strike unless the Federal Government implemented agreement reached with it and meet its other demands. He also demanded urgent steps to rectify irregularities that accompanied payment of February salary to its members through Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System. According to him, victimisation of many ASUP officials that participated in lawful struggle had continued unabated, adding that seven lecturers of the Institute of Management Technology, Enugu, and the Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo, had been dismissed for participating in union activities, while two others from Yaba College of Technology were suspended. “Based on these which epitomise neglect, disregard and disrespect to the sector; coupled with the insincerity of the government in respecting signed agreements entered into with our union, the union is hereby issuing a 15-day ultimatum to resolve these pending issues affecting the sector or face industrial action by our union without the benefit of any other warning,” Ezeibe added.
