Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has adjusted the dates of the completion of the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculations Examination, saying the exercise would end “in the early days of next week” as against Saturday, April 4, on the schedule. JAMB said the move was to address the public panic over the coronavirus scare whereby schools and other public places were shutting down across the country. The JAMB Head of Media, Dr Fabian Benjamin, in a statement on Thursday, confirmed the new dates, saying a large proportion of the total 1.9million candidates who registered had been attended to and only few centres in Rivers and Bayelsa states had till next week to finish the examination. He said, “The board has not rescheduled its examination as being speculated. All examination will be finishing on Saturday with only few centres in Bayelsa and Rivers who will be writing in the early days of next week. “The board in its determined efforts to give the candidates the best has adjusted the schedules of the remaining candidates in these two states. We have also contacted the few candidates to reprint their slips. It’s not a general thing as it is being rumoured.” Copyright PUNCH.
