Oladimeji Ramon The Lagos State Government has arrested an unnamed woman for inflicting injuries on her 12-year-old son in the course of beating him. The government took up the case after finding the picture of the boy covered in his own blood trending on Facebook. The Director, Directorate of Citizens’ Rights, Mrs Biola Oseni, said in a statement on Monday that the incident happened on Sunday in the Agege area of the state. Oseni said after seeing the picture of the bloodied boy on Facebook, officials of the directorate traced him to No. 64 Moricass Road, Agege, where he was rescued. She said though the officials did not meet the mother at home, they later found her in the neighbourhood, where she was arrested and taken to a police station. Oseni stated, “Officials of the ministry (of justice), during a visit to the home, gathered that the boy was assaulted by his mother. “The matter was reported at the police station; the woman’s husband was mandated to produce the boy, while she was at the police station. “The woman will be charged on Tuesday, March 3, 2020 (today), while the boy will be taken to the Ministry of Youth and Social Development for necessary action and be placed in one of the government’s facilities.” Copyright PUNCH.
