Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi A Human Rights Activist, Dr Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, has challenged the Academic Staff Union of Universities and other relevant academic unions to rise up and fight the rising cases of sexual harassment in Nigerian universities. She advised that if ASUU and other academic unions were reluctant in standing against the menace, women lecturers should form their academic unions to fight sexual harassment and gender-based violence which she added was a “disgrace” to higher institutions of learning. Akiyode-Afolabi, who is the Founder Director of Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre, stated this in an interview at the end of one-day training support for lecturers and administrators on protection of girls in tertiary institution in Bauchi State. She said, “I think ASUU needs to sit up in this matter, the body language of ASUU is not showing that they are ready to tackle this issue head on. If ASUU does not think it is important to discuss this matter because they see it as women matter, then women in higher institutions should start their own Academic Staff Unions.” She lamented that sexual harassment and gender- based violence had affected education negatively pointing out that a lot of students had left school because they failed for an offense they didn’t commit. The human rights activist described sexual and gender- based violence as a problem for the country and the educational system, stressing that “it’s a big issue.” Copyright PUNCH.
