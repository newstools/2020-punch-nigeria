A House of Representatives Member, Balarabe Kakale, has said the House has set March 12 to debate on the reforms in the Almajiri system of education in the country. Kakale, who represents Bodinga/Dange-Shuni/Tureta Federal Constituency in Sokoto State, made this known in a statement on Saturday. The lawmaker said that the move was part of the legislators’ commitment to reform the system. He said, “This is aimed at making the system to be better, as well as realigning it to be in tune with globally-accepted standards within the context of religion, tradition, culture and socio-economic realities. “The day has been set aside only for debate on the Almajiri system – all other legislative businesses will wait that day. “We need to review and enhance the curriculum to prepare the Qur’anic students for the 21st century, vocational training, technical training, entrepreneurship, and the National Almajiri Summit.” The lawmaker further explained that the day would provide the opportunity for the members and major stakeholders to understand the roots of the system with a view to reforming it.
