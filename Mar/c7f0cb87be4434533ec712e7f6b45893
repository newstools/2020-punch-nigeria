Friday Olokor, Abuja The All Progressive Grand Alliance on Thursday said it would not collapse into the All Progressives Congress after the exit of Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State in 2021. The party also bemoaned the security situation in Nigeria, saying residents now living on the edge as kidnappers and bandits had taken over the country. The National Secretary of APGA and a former Minister of Information, Labaran Maku, spoke in Abuja during a courtesy call on him by leaders of the party from Nasarawa State. He said, “I am aware that people are going from house to house to bribe members of APGA to dump the party. But speaking for myself and as a member of APGA, the insinuation that APGA will go under or collapse into the APC is absolutely false. This is not the first transition APGA has successfully done and given the momentum of development we have had in Anambra under Governor Wille Obiano, APGA will certainly retain the state.” According to him, APGA should be seeking to export its achievements in good  governance to other parts of the country by winning other states and not only  Anambra. The former minister said in 2021, APGA would replicate its exploits in 2017 when the party won majority votes in all the 21 Local Government  areas in Anambra State during the governorship election. Speaking on insecurity, Maku stated that Anambra remained the most peaceful state in Nigeria unlike Nasarawa State where, he said, people slept with one eye open. Copyright PUNCH.
