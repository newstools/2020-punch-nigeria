Wale Oyewale, Ibadan A former member of the House of Representatives, Oladipupo Adebutu, has denied defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party. Adebutu, a former governorship aspirant of the PDP in Ogun State, while denying reports that he was a defector, said, he remained a bona-fide member of the PDP. Speaking through his Media Consultant, Afolabi Orekoya, on Thursday, Adebutu said he was at the Ibadan rally of the South-West PDP as a national leader of the party and not as a defector. He said, “It is wrong to say that Oladipupo Adebutu was a defector when he, actually, did not leave the party in the first place. The former representative of Sagamu/Ikenne/Remo North Federal Constituency in the National Assembly did not defect so he needs not join again. “As a prominent PDP member, he is a part of those determined to dislodge the ruling All Progressives Congress in coming elections in the country. He was among the larger body of party faithful who welcomed defectors back to the party fold on Wednesday.” Copyright PUNCH.
