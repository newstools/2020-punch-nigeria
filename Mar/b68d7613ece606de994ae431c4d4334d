Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, which was closed in August 2019 for rehabilitation work, will be reopened for use before Easter 2020, the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, has said. Sirika gave the commitment after an inspection visit to the airport on Thursday, according to a statement issued in Abuja by the Director, Public Affairs, Federal Ministry of Aviation, James Odaudu. He said the Federal Government recognised the importance of the airport to the whole of the South-East and the hardship occasioned by the closure, but insisted that it was done in the interest of safety and comfort of air travellers from the region. On the reported shortage of some materials needed by the contractor, the minister said the problem was being addressed and would not be an impediment to the completion of the project. He commended the handlers of the project for the quality of the job being done, and expressed confidence that the airport, when delivered, would be one of the best in the country. Sirika also promised that work on the new terminal building at the airport would soon resume in earnest, given the budgetary provision for it in the 2020 budget. He further disclosed that the present regime met the terminal project at about 20 per cent completion stage but had taken it to about 60 per cent. The minister was joined on the inspection visit by representatives of the Enugu State Government and the South-East Governors Forum. The statement stated that other persons on the visit with Sirika were officials of the Federal Ministry of Aviation, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and consultants to the project.
