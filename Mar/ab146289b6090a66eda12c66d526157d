Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki Business mogul and industrialist of the South-East extraction, Chief Cletus Ibeto, has tipped Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State for president, come 2023. Ibeto endorsed Umahi for the number one position in the country, while receiving an honorary award at the Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki, during its 7th to 11th combined convocation. He described Umahi as a man of honour who always delivered on his promises, adding that the governor was competent for the 2023 presidency. He said, “Anybody visiting Ebonyi State now will be amazed and full of wonder and admiration for what his Excellency has done and turned this state into in just a few years. I am proud to be associated with him. “Governor Umahi has initiated the use of cement in road construction, producing concrete roadways that would last a very long time and will be less difficult and less expensive to maintain. Over 300km of such concrete roads have been built. “He has been paying civil servants their salaries and allowances regularly. He has moved Ebonyi to become the rice basin of Nigeria. He has made education to deserve the special attention it currently has. “This has resulted in unprecedented sharp increases in undergraduate enrolment in universities. “He has moved Ebonyi State into an enviable position as the fastest growing economy in Nigeria. “Notwithstanding the fact that I am not a prophet, I am inspired to predict that, based on his records of service in Ebonyi State, when the question, “Who shall we send, and, who will go for us?’ comes up, your name will ring forth for recognition for very serious consideration.” Copyright PUNCH.
