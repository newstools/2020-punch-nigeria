Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi Activities at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos were disrupted over electricity power outage. It was gathered that passengers’ movement was disrupted as the airport became dark after the lights went out on Wednesday morning. The General Manager, Corporate Affairs of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, confirmed the incident. She said it was not within the terminal but the passage leading to the car park. Yakubu said the electrical fault was rectified after a few minutes. Interruption of electricity power supply has been a regular occurrence at the nation’s busiest airport. Stakeholders in the industry have in the past called for independent power plants for not just the Lagos airport but other viable airports across the country for better passenger facilitation.
