Success Nwogu The Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party Governors’ Forum, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, has intervened in  the crisis that resulted in the  suspension of  the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives,  Ndudi Elumelu, and  other PDP members of the House. A member of the PDP National Working Committee, who spoke to our correspondent on  condition of anonymity  in Abuja on Saturday,  said Tambuwal was asked to intervene  in the crisis because  of  his experience as a former Speaker of the lower chamber of the National Assembly. The source  said,  “Being a former Speaker and Chairman of the PDPGF, it is hoped that he (Tambuwal) will look at the matter and find solutions.” Efforts by our correspondent to get information on how far Tambuwal had gone in addressing the matter were unsuccessful. The  media aide to the governor,  Mohammed Bello, who promised to give  our correspondent an update on the issue did not answer his  calls. The  PDP NWC  on July 5, 2019  suspended  Elumelu and five other legislators  for one month  for alleged “indiscipline, insubordination and disobedience to the party’s  directives”. However,  the PDP has yet to review their suspension since then. The other PDP Reps suspended alongside  Elumelu are   Wole Oke, Lynda Ikpeazu, Anayo Edwin, Gideon Gwani, Toby Okechukwu  and Adekoya Abdul-Majid. Contrary to the PDP’s position,  Elumelu emerged as  House Minority Leader. The PDP NWC  set up the Iyorchia   Ayu Committee and the  Tom Ikimi Disciplinary Committee to handle the  matter.
