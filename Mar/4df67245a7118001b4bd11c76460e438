The complainant was angry with him and Onikoyi assaulted him and injured him with the vehicle’s key. “The offences contravene sections 355 and 451 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012.” The prosecutor asked the court for an adjournment to enable him to study the case file and present his witnesses.
