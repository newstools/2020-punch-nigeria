Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Osun State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Gboyega Famodun, on Monday, said the recent defection of ex-governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola to the Peoples Democratic Party, would not adversely affect the fortunes of the APC. Famoodun said this a statement by his media consultant, Kola Olabisi, in Osogbo. He said there was no way “the theatrical political display orchestrated by the renowned association of serial political losers,” would give Governor Adegboyega Oyetola sleepless nights. The APC chairman dismissed Oyinlola’s exit from the APC as the “self-exit of representatives of darkness.” The statement read in part, “The recent Ibadan show of theatrical political movements of some reactionary gladiators back to their vomit went further to corroborate some provisions of the nation’s constitution that it is part of the inalienable fundamental rights of Nigerians to freely exercise freedom of movement and association without causing hardship to another Nigerians or foreigners legally living in this country. “I congratulate the APC on the self-exit of representatives of darkness in the APC who had hitherto been pretending as worthy members and leaders adding value to same but secretly working underneath to compromise the ideal of the party.” Oyinlola and the Secretary to the Osun State Government during his reign, Fatai Akinbade, as well as 50 others recently defected to the PDP. Oyinlola, who was elected governor of Osun State in 2003 and later served as the National Secretary of the PDP, dumped PDP for the APC in the build-up to the August 9, 2014 governorship election.
