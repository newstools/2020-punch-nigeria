Sola Shittu, Benin The Edo state chapter of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP on Sunday elected a former member of the House of Representatives, Tony Aziegbemi, as the new chairman of the party in the state. Two local government areas, Ovia North East and Etsako West, however, boycotted the state congress that produced Aziegbemi. Aziegbemi, who is replacing Mr Dan Orbih, whose tenure expired last week, was said to be a kinsman of the late chieftain of the party, Chief Anthony Anenih. He defeated his closest rival, Felix Imoisil, in the contest for the chairmanship during the party’s State Congress held in Benin City, with 817 votes to 488 votes. Copyright PUNCH.
