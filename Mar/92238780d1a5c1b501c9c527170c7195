Cristiano Ronaldo attended El Clasico in Madrid last night and a close source to the Juventus star Edu Aguirre claimed he “has a desire to return” to Real Madrid. The Portugal international left Los Blancos in 2018 and won Serie A in his first season with Juventus, currently fighting on all fronts this term as well. He continued his great form in Turin and has already scored 53 goals in his first 74 games with the Bianconeri. When he was at the Santiago Bernabeu to watch Real Madrid win 2-0 against Barcelona, Aguirre talked about their former talisman after the match. “I know for sure that Cristiano has a desire to return to Real Madrid,” Aguirre told Chiringuito TV. “He felt the affection of Madrid when he came to Bernabeu, he was excited. “Now he is totally focused on Juventus, but in football, never say never,” he added. “I don’t know what will happen in the future, nobody can know.”
