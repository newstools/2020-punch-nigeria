Nike Popoola AIICO Insurance Plc says it is committed to promoting gender balance and equal opportunity for women. A statement by the firm said to mark the 2020 International Women’s Day, the company organised a women’s conference themed ‘Women’s visibility in the workplace,’ in Lagos. Speaking at the event, Head of Retail Life Operations, AIICO, Mrs Titilola Okunlola said the company was committed to promoting women’s visibility, and providing the enabling environment for women to thrive and be their very best. The Head, Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability, Mrs Abimbola Shobanjo, said gender equality as one of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals was a priority area for the company. She said, “Management provides necessary support for causes and initiatives that align with it. The company, in its bid to promote gender parity, has organised this conference to lend its voice to the global call for equality, empowerment and increased visibility for women.” The guest speaker, Dr Glory Edozien, a public speaker and a thought leader on women’s empowerment, challenged women not to rest on their oars but accomplish more, break limits, showcase their skills and capabilities and improve their career. She stated that speaking out was one of the ways to promote visibility. She said, “You can’t be visible if you don’t tell people about what you do or what you can do. You must be heard.” She advised women to pitch for opportunities, sell their value and network within and outside of the workplace. Copyright PUNCH.
