WBC heavyweight champion Tyson Fury has fired a dig at rival boxer Anthony Joshua and suggested his fellow Brit – who holds the other three major belts in the division – is not a real champion. Fury was stripped of the titles Joshua now occupies after his well-publicised struggles outside of the ring following his win over Wladimir Klitschko in 2015, though has fought his way back to the pinnacle of the sport. The Gypsy King stopped Deontay Wilder in seven rounds last week, though the American has triggered a rematch clause with a trilogy fight set to take place in July. That means a unification fight between Fury and Joshua will have to wait until the end of 2020, though the WBC champion has played down the significance and does not see AJ as a true champion. Asked about taking on Joshua to become the undisputed champ, Fury said on This Morning, “I’ve already been the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world when I beat Klitschko. I had all the belts. “So as far as I’m concerned Anthony Joshua has only got my leftovers because I never lost those belts, I had to vacate them for mental health problems to focus on me.” When presenter Holly Willoughby suggested Joshua’s belts really belonged to Fury, he agreed, ‘Yeah. They’re my belts.” Tyson’s wife Paris chimed in, adding, “He (Joshua) is just keeping them warm.” Copyright PUNCH.
