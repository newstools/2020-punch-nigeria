Johnny Edward Ex-Manchester United defender Derek Brazil is pleased with the performance of new signing Odion Ighalo. Former Irish international Brazil played for the Red Devils from 1988 to 1992. Since arriving from Chinese Super League club Shanghai Greenland Shenhua, Ighalo has netted three times in seven games for Manchester United. Speaking with Love Sport Radio, Brazil admitted that Ighalo was proving people wrong. “The games that he’s started in, the games that he’s come on in, he is a centre-forward, out-and-out centre forward,” Brazil told Love Sport Radio. “When a new player comes to United, especially one who’s had a few doubts about him like Ighalo, the bits that he came on in the games, he held the ball up well, he brings people into play, and he always wants to get in the six-yard box. “Martial is different. As a centre-half I’d prefer to play against someone like Martial because you know that if you do give them a little wack from behind, then he’s not going to try and recover that ball. “Ighalo for me is proving people wrong. And he took his goal- I know it was only Derby but it was two good finishes.

You’re talking eight, nine times out of 10, he’ll keep it.” Copyright PUNCH.
