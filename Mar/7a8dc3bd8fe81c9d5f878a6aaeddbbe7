Solape Lawal-Solarin Former Liverpool star, Micheal Owen, has been impressed with Nigerian striker, Odion Ighalo, hailing his impact despite coming on as a late sub in the derby win against Manchester City at Old Trafford. The Red Devils’ new acquisition is earning rave reviews after initially suffering undue criticisms after his deadline transfer move to Old Trafford in January. Ighalo followed up his five-star performance in the FA Cup win against Derby by providing the hold-up play that led to United’s second goal against rivals, City. “Ighalo, look at his strength and awareness. I like him, I must admit. I think he’s a great alternative. “Hats off to McTominay because he could have easily sat in midfield, get behind the ball, make sure we don’t take any risks. He anticipates it, he leaves his position,” Owen told Premier League Productions. Copyright PUNCH.
