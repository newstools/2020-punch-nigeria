Matthew Ochei, Asaba Following the incessant cases of Fulani herdsmen attacks on Delta communities, the state House of Assembly has passed a resolution urging Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to prevail on security agencies to beef up security in the Aniocha North Local Government Area and other affected parts of the state. Moving a motion under matters of urgent public importance on Wednesday, the member representing Aniocha North constituency, Mr Emeka Nwaobi, who was seconded by the member representing Ika South, Mr Festus Okoh, recalled the incessant attacks on the people of Aniocha North by Fulani herdsmen. He frowned on huge ransoms paid to secure the release of kidnapped victims, while others were still in captivity, lamenting that Issele-Azagba community was the worst hit by the herdsmen who had killed, maimed and raped people in the area as well as denied them access to their farmlands. In separate contributions, the House Majority Leader, Tim Owhefere; Deputy Majority Leader, Oboro Preyor; Chief Whip, Pat Ajudua; the member representing Ndokwa West, Charles Emetulu; and the member representing Ika South, Festus Okoh; recalled the havoc wreaked by herdsmen in communities across the state and called for concerted efforts to prevent more killings. The lawmakers commended the governors of the South-South for their decision to create a security outfit for the zone in bid to curtail the excesses of the nefarious herdsmen. The Speaker, Chief Sheriff Oborowori, said the motion was in line with section 14 (2b) of the constitution, which stipulated that the security and welfare of the people was the sole responsibility of government. The motion was unanimously adopted. Copyright PUNCH.
