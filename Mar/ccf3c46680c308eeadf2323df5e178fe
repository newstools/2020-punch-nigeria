Cristiano Ronaldo’s mother said on Thursday that she was “recovering well” from the stroke that brought the Portuguese star hurrying to her bedside in Madeira earlier in the week. “In a few days, God willing, I will be able to resume my normal life,” wrote 65-year-old Dolores Aveiro on her Instagram account. “I am aware of everything that has happened to me and fully aware that I have been very lucky.” On Tuesday, the 35-year-old Ronaldo skipped training with his club Juventus and flew to Madeira with his wife and one of his sons.
