Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi A Bauchi State High Court has convicted a 21-year-old man for criminal conspiracy, possession of firearms and armed robbery and therefore, sentenced him to 21 years’ imprisonment. The convict, Bala Ahmadu, hails from the Mangu Local Government Area of Plateau State. Delivering his judgment, the presiding Judge, Justice Aliyu Usman, explained that the offence contravened section 221 of the penal code. The state counsel, H. Magaji, had earlier told the court that the convict committed armed robberies and cattle rustling across Bauchi State including that of Yelwan Kadaran Wambai of the Bauchi Local Government Area. He said during the convict’s last operation, he shot someone in the process and he died instantly from the attack. In the second charge, the convict was accused of arming himself with an AK-47 rifle, cutlasses and other weapons and robbed residents of Yelwan Kadara of their motorcycles and money. This, he said, was contrary to section 1(2) and B of the Robbery and Firearms Act of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The presiding judge said the sentences were to run concurrently. Copyright PUNCH.
