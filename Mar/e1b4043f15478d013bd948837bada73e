The national oil firm said that out of the vandalised points, 10 failed to be welded, while none was ruptured. It said Atlas Cove-Mosimi and Mosimi-Ibadan axis accounted for 35 per cent and 30 per cent of the breaks respectively, while other routes accounted for the remaining 35 per cent.

According to the statement, the national oil firm grew its trading surplus to N5.28bn in December 2019 from the N3.95bn in November. The NNPC said the 34 per cent increase for the period resulted from improved performances by some of its entities both in the upstream and downstream sectors. It said the performance was impacted positively by the reduced deficit posted by the NNPC corporate headquarters and adjustments to previously understated revenues by Integrated Data Services Limited and Duke Oil. The corporation also reported a reduction in the costs of pipeline repairs/Right of Way maintenance and gas purchases by the Nigerian Pipeline and Storage Company and the Nigeria Gas Marketing Company respectively. It said out of the 239.29 billion cubic feet of gas supplied in December, a total of 148.32bcf was commercialised, consisting of 34.7bcf and 113.54bcf for the domestic and export market respectively. ”Copyright PUNCH.
