Samuel Awoyinfa Honeywell Flour Mills has said that it will be partnering the Lagos State Government in its bid to feed 200,000 low-income families during the COVID-19 crisis. A statement from the company indicated that it also supported the state government’s directives on the containment of the deadly disease. It stated, “We fully support the Lagos State Government’s objective of implementing social distancing policies across the state. We also recognise the unfortunate challenge this restriction of movement will place on many Lagosians, who need to leave their homes daily to earn an income to feed their families. “In this regard, we will be supporting the Lagos State Government’s goal of feeding 200,000 low-income families by providing customised Honeywell Flour Mills food packs. These packs, containing various food products, will feed one family for one month.” Copyright PUNCH.
