Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Three members of the Oodua People’s Congress, on Monday, appeared before an Osun State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Osogbo for subjecting one Nurudeen Adeniyi to torture over a missing mobile phone at a palm wine joint. Adeniyi was accused of stealing a mobile phone at the joint located in the Ori Eru area of Osogbo and the incident was reported to some OPC members in the area. After receiving a complaint from the owner of the joint, the defendants were said to have arrested Adeniyi from his house and took him to their office, where he was held for about 13 hours, during which he was subjected to severe torture. The defendants, Bakare Banke, Oluwafemi Olaoye and Adeyinka Simiyu, were apprehended by the police on Friday at the Oke Baale area of Osogbo after Adeniyi lodged a complaint against them.
