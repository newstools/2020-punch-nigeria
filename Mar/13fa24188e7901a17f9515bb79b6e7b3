Kenya is seeking the postponement of this month’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Group G leaders Comoros, due to an international travel ban placed on athletes as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The Kenyan sports ministry on Tuesday issued a one-month travel suspension for Kenyan athletes to international competitions following the global outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Kenya was due to host Comoros on the first leg in Nairobi on March 25, with the return leg in Moroni four days later. Football Kenya Federation chief, Nick Mwendwa, said it would not be possible to host the islanders since the country’s health ministry had also cancelled all meetings, conferences and international events in Kenya.

The country’s travel ban has also led to the cancellation of two African cricket and rugby competitions scheduled for Nairobi. (AFP)
