Daud Olatunji Former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun has lamented that a former majority leader of the state House of Assembly, Yinka Mafe, who he described as a great loyalist died the day he intended to surprise him with a federal appointment letter. The former governor told the congregation at the burial service held at the St Barnabas Anglican Church, Emuren Remo. Amosun explained that he had used his influence to get a federal appointment for Mafe before he received the sad news of his death. Mafe who was a two-time member of the state House of Assembly, representing  Sagamu State Constituency 1 died on Tuesday, February 4, the day of his birthday. He explained that he purposely planned to present him the appointment letter on his birthday, before death took him away. He further said, “We take solace in the fact that even though he died at a young age, he still impacted on a lot of people in the little time he spent on earth.” He described the deceased as a principled and loyal politician who impacted community during his short time on earth. Earlier in his brief sermon,  Venerable Joseph Amadu said Mafe had impacted his community and church meaningfully despite his short life. The cleric said the deceased on the day of his death, had earlier donated various items to the  widows, needy and prisoners in his area. Copyright PUNCH.
