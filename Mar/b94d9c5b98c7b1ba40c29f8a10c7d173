Sunday Aborisade Two bills seeking the establishment of the South- East and the North-Central development commissions passed second reading on the floor of the Senate on Thursday. But the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, urged Nigerians to focus more on how to make the country’s national developmental plans work rather than stressing on regional commissions. The bills were passed after the sponsors led debates on the general principles of the proposals. Senator Stella Oduah, who read the lead debate on the South-East Development Commission, said the agency, if established, would help to tackle the humongous ecological problems affecting the zone. She said, “The establishment of the commission will tackle infrastructural deficit and as well engage the youth in productive ventures in the region.” In a related development, Senator Abba Moro, who led the debate on the North Central Development Commission Bill, noted that the region had been devastated by flood, banditry, terrorism and erosion, stressing that the commission would help ameliorate the situation. He said, “Over the years, herders/ farmers clashes have been a serious menace in the North-Central, especially in Benue State. Insurgency and banditry have also resulted in a lot of displacement of numerous inhabitants of the region. “Funds allocated to the commission by donor agencies and the Federal Government will be used to rehabilitate the displaced people and address other environmental problems in the zone.” The senators supported the bill and it was read the second time when put to voice vote by the President of the Senate.
