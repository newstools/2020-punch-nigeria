’Femi Asu Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company has said it is committed to ensuring regular power supply in the event of a national shutdown on the back of COVID-19. The Disco said in a statement on Wednesday that its statutory duty would not be crippled by the pandemic, adding that it was prepared to service its customers through various online platforms for payment, vending of power and resolving customers’ complaints. The statement said, “The company, in its bid to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, is scaling down people’s presence in business locations to limit physical interaction between employees and customers until the situation improves. “The management particularly instructed all customer relationship officers, commercial line workers and any other employee that interface with the customers to stop their activities immediately until they are well equipped to handle the situation.” According to the statement, gloves, hand sanitisers and medical masks have been distributed across its franchise to ensure the safety of all the workers on essential duties who cannot work remotely. It said, “The IBEDC’s management is therefore strongly recommending that customers should call the customer care number to report faults and make enquiries; they should make use of our hassle-free payment platforms or visit our website for more options. “This is to further reduce physical contact in order to comply with the social distancing prevention protocol.” Copyright PUNCH.
