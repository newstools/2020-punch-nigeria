Raphael Ede, Enugu The 17 council chairmen and the 260 councillors who were elected during the Saturday’s Enugu Local Government Election, have been sworn in. Inaugurating the new council chairmen at the Okpara Square, Independence Layout, Enugu, on Monday, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi charged them to make the provision of infrastructure in their respective localities their watchword. Ugwuanyi also charged them to ensure that peace reigns in their respective areas without which there would be no development. The Enugu State Independent Electoral Commission, on Sunday declared candidates of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, as the winners of the 17 councils chairmanship and 260 wards councillorship leaving none for the opposition parties. Addressing the newly elected council chairmen, Ugwuanyi urged them not to betray the confidence reposed in them to deliver the democracy dividends for their people. Ugwuanyi enjoined them to live in their respective council areas and not to administer their people from outside. He said, “We view absenteeism seriously.  You shall not administer your local government from outside.” During his second tenure inauguration speech, Ugwuanyi had said chairmen should dwell and administer the council areas in the council areas instead of staying abroad or in the urban areas.
