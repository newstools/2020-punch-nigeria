Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri, says his government will construct the second flyover at the Etegwe-Edepie roundabout in Yenagoa, which the administration of his predecessor, Seriake Dickson, proposed but could not embark on it. He said this on Sunday during the thanksgiving reception of the member representing Yenagoa Constituency 1 in the House of Assembly, Oboku Oforji, on his victory in court over alleged certificate forgery. Diri, who had earlier attended a thanksgiving service in honour of Oforji at the Church of God Mission, Yenagoa, said the flyover, the second to be built in Yenagoa, would solve the problem of gridlock in the Etegwe-Edepie area of the state capital. Diri said cost of the flyover project would be reflected in this year’s budget to be presented soon to the House of Assembly. He said, “This period is not for campaigns. We are now in power, and we promised you so many things. “Let me say that the Etegwe-Edepie flyover project will be included in this year’s budget to be presented soon to the House of Assembly. My predecessor did well not to have done the budget. He insisted that it would be done by the  incoming government. So, for that reason, I gave my promise about the flyover at Edepie.” Copyright PUNCH.
