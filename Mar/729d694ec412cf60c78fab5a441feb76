Olufemi Atoyebi, Abuja The Nigeria Medical Association has directed all striking doctors and other health workers to return to work. The body promised to meet with  the relevant agencies to address their agitations and grievances. Addressing journalists in Abuja on Friday,  the President of the association, Dr Francis Faduyile, said the action was taken to enable the NMA to help stop coronavirus spread in  the country. Resident doctors in Abuja on Wednesday began an indefinite strike over non-payment of their salaries and allowances while other health workers in the  various states have also declared industrial actions. Faduyile said, “As the world is battling the spread of coronavirus with numerous researches into its prevention, treatment and vaccination, we need to up our game in the area of preparedness, management and containing its spread in our dear country. “In line with the above, we direct all medical associations that have declared industrial actions against their management to suspend all actions as the National NMA shall take over the dispute and interact with the different organs/agencies of government. “The Association of Resident Doctors of Federal Capital Territory Authority, Gombe, ESUT-Parklane and Kaduna as well as NMA Cross River are directed to return to work and treat Nigerians. This gesture is geared towards treating fellow Nigerians notwithstanding the inhuman treatment meted to our members nationwide.” Copyright PUNCH.
