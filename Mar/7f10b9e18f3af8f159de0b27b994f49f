Chima Azubuike, Gombe The Governor of Gombe State, Inuwa Yahaya, has alleged that the administration of former governor Ibrahim Dankwambo, spent over N7bn out of the actual N11bn on elephant projects. He noted that his administration came with a mission to improve the living condition of the people of the state. Yahaya stated this on Monday at the presentation of the report of the Committee on Mega Park, Tankers Bay and the International Conference Centre headed by the Deputy Governor, Manassah Jatau, at the Government House, Chamber. The governor said, “In order to improve human capital you must manage projects prudently and efficiently. “That was why we set up the committee with specific terms of reference. We will need to study the report to know how best to implement the recommendations of the committee. “N7bn has so far been wasted on those projects, in other to make those projects functional to work.” He added that his administration would do everything possible to get the projects working.
