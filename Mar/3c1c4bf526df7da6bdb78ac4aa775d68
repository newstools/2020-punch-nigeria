Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that the fear of contacting COVID-19 compelled him to adjust his three-day birthday. Obasanjo said this on Thursday while addressing well-wishers at his 83rd birthday celebration held at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta. Ogun State recorded one index case of the infectious virus when an Italian visited a company in Ewekoro for a business consultation. Obasanjo’s birthday celebration which was initially scheduled to hold for three days was compressed into one day. Explaining the adjustment, Obasanjo said, “When we were thinking of this celebration, two programmes came to mind. “One was to see what Asian countries have done to make their continent become what they have become, for instance, Malaysia, which was worse than us when we got independence; South Korea which was below us and Vietnam which was plunged into series of wars. “We would have spent the day before yesterday and yesterday to really consider how the Asians have risen to greatness. “And what lessons we could learn from them but because of Coronavirus, that programme was shelved. Some of them were not able to make it.”
