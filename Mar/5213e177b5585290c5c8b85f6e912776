Matthew Ochei, Asaba The Coordinator of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Delta State chapter,  Mr John Chukwuma, and four other members of the group have been arrested in Asaba. The PUNCH gathered that the IPOB members were arrested on Saturday at their shops. A member of the group told our correspondent that the arrest of Chukwuma and others marked the highpoint of police crackdown on members of the group in the state. He said Chukwuma was arrested last Saturday at his wife’s trading store by armed security operatives and whisked away to an unknown destination. He accused the police and Delta State Government of working hand in hand to harass and intimidate members of the group in the state. He said, “Regularly, the police and Delta State government clamp down on our members and throw them into detention. “Many of our members have been killed, many others languishing in detention without trial.” The Delta State Commissioner of Police, Mr Hafiz Inuwa, when contacted on the telephone, said the arrest and detention of the IPOB members should not call for concern. He said, “I have been receiving calls from within and outside the country over the arrest of IPOB members; whether they are arrested or not, it doesn’t matter. “I cannot speak on that because these people are a proscribed group and I don’t see any reason to report on them.” Copyright PUNCH.
