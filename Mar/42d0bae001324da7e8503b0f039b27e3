Samuel Awoyinfa The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry has expressed the concern for the Federal Government to protect the vulnerable citizens and businesses in the wake of the outbreak of the coronavirus in the country. This was contained in a statement signed by the President of the chamber, Mrs Toki Mabogunje on Friday, a copy of which was made available to our correspondent. The LCCI stated that there was a need for the government to invoke the appropriate Executive Orders to safeguard public health, security and food security. While it stressed that the current situation demand all the sacrifice both private individuals, organisations and the government could make, it added that there should be seamless access to medical and food supplies, especially by the vulnerable groups. It stated, “On the policy front, we acknowledge the stimulus package proposed by the Central Bank of Nigeria, the economic stimulus bill introduced by the House of Representatives and the pledge by the finance minister.” Copyright PUNCH.
