The Nigerian Ambassador to the Republic of Togo, Mr Olusola Iji, has berated the leadership of the Ondo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, for its inability to resolve the lingering internal crisis in the party. Iji, who is also a governorship aspirant of the party, warned that unless the crisis was resolved, the party would lose the forthcoming governorship election in October. The former diplomat stated this while declaring his governorship ambition before some party leaders and supporters in Akure, the Ondo State capital, on Monday. He said there was an urgent need for the party members to reunite and move the party to victory in October. He said, “We need to close ranks and work together, though I’m not a member of the Unity Forum but last time I attended their meeting and told them that as divided as our party is, it is not possible for us to win the election. “Unless there is reconciliation, the issue of winning the election is foregone.” Iji, who inaugurated the coordinators of his group – the Sunshine Mandate Group, for the 18 local government areas of the state, said it was the turn of the Ondo South Senatorial District of the state to be given the ticket of the party and not the Ondo North where the governor came from. He said, “We are seeking the ticket of the party, the ticket of the party was zone to the north, we from the south, we never contested it, he (Akeredolu)  collected the ticket of the party in 2012, he collected it in 2016 and still wants to collect it in 2020, no way for that.” Copyright PUNCH.
