Rasheed Bisiriyu The Stallion Group has said it will provide locally-produced rice and fish free to all government-run hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 cases. It said the donation would be made available through its philanthropic arm, Stallion Empowerment Initiative, as part of its support for the government at all levels and individuals already afflicted with coronavirus currently fighting the disease at various hospitals nationwide. It said in a statement on Sunday that the gesture, which would last for three months, was its contribution to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic in the country. The statement quoted the Chief Executive Office of the Stallion Group, Anant Badjatya, that the organisation had further committed one staff bus each for the five government-run COVID-19 hospitals in Lagos. “The group will also provide drivers and fuel for these buses. This arrangement will help ensure safer and comfortable transportation of our healthcare workers who are in the frontline in this fight against the virus,” it stated. The Chairman of the Stallion Group, Mr Sunil Vaswani, said, “These are exceptionally difficult times and urgent emergency resources have to be deployed to cope with the needs of affected states and support their healthcare systems.” Copyright PUNCH.
