Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Osun State Government on Sunday disclosed plans to introduce prepaid water meter for residents of the state. The government said the measure was necessary for it to ensure adequate maintenance of its water equipment  and regular water supply to the residents. Addressing newsmen on the occasion of this year’s Water Day Celebration, the state Commissioner for Water Resources and Energy, Dr Amidu Tadese, explained that despite plans to have pre paid water meters installed across the state, many customers would continue to pay after supply of water to them on monthly basis. He said, “There is a need for government to maintain the equipment and facilities for sustainability. The citizens will have to pay water bills accordingly and also help in maintaining these facilities in their different communities. “Prepaid water meters will be installed while some customers will still be billed directly. In whatever category we fall into, we should endeavour to pay our water bills, so that there will be funds in the government coffers to maintain this good project. “With this scourge of the deadly COVID-19, citizens of State of Osun are encouraged to observe or make deliberate effort to take care of their personal hygiene.” Speaking on the government’s plan to ensure adequate water supply across the state, Adeniran Ibitoye, the Special Adviser to the governor on Water Resources, said plans were on to ensure provision of potable water for the people of the state. He said, “As of today, we are happy to inform the people of the state that the Ilesa Water Supply and Sanitation project would be delivered within the shortest possible time.” ”Copyright PUNCH.
