Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Israeli Defence Ministry has launched an app that can detect coronavirus through an infected person’s voice. The mobile application uses “a vocal fingerprint” to help detect COVID-19 symptoms in individuals and prioritise testing and treatment. Vocalis Health, an Israeli startup company working with hospitals and academic institutions, will sample voices of confirmed coronavirus patients through the application in a research project led by the ministry, Reuters reports. “These voice samples will be analysed using an artificial intelligence-based algorithm in order to identify the unique vocal ‘fingerprint’,” the ministry said in a statement. The coronavirus affects the respiratory system and signs of distress can be reflected in the patterns of a person’s voice and breathing. President and CEO of Vocalis Health, Tal Wenderow, said the algorithm would be used for remote diagnosis and monitoring. At the current stage, he said, the app would only be used by medical staff together with the patients taking part in the study, but the company’s website allows for anyone to take part and send a voice sample to the researchers. Researchers hope that healthcare systems would be able to use the data to prioritise testing and hospitalisation, allowing patients with light symptoms to stay at home. The ministry said the monitoring system “can be conducted from afar, in order to prevent the spread of the disease and overburdening of the national healthcare system.” Initial results of the study were expected within six weeks. Israel has reported more than 1,600 coronavirus cases and three fatalities. Copyright PUNCH.
