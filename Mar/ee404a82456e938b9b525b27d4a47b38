Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives is proposing amendments to the Economic and Financial Crimes Establishment Act to include states and local governments in the sharing of recovered funds and assets. According to an amendment bill which passed reading on Thursday, recovered loot or seized assets belong to all tiers of governments. The House also wants assets under temporal seizure by the EFCC to be maintained by a receiver-manager until final seizure ordered by a court or prosecution of the suspect. Sponsor of the bill, Mr Ozurigbo Ugonna, said the idea was to protect suspects who might eventually win the case instituted against them. A draft copy of the bill obtained by our correspondent, seeks to amend Sections 14, 20, 21, 22, and 29 to enable the state and local governments to “take benefit of their inalienable rights to repatriation, restitution, costs and damages whenever their fund or property is the subject of an offence.” An amended Section 26 would allow government to appoint receiver-managers to take over operation of companies or businesses that are consequents of financial crimes “until such time that the assets and property of the affected companies or business will be sold or disposed to willing investors.” A new Section 31 would bar EFCC officials or the Attorney General of the Federation from disposing assets and properties of state and local governments that form subject of an offence. Leading the debate during the second reading of the bill at the plenary, Ugonna cited a case of where the EFCC seized a company and seals the premises, forcing the workers to lose their jobs, only for the case instituted by the commission to be dismissed by court.
