Manchester United great Rio Ferdinand has explained why he’s changed his mind on January transfer window loan signing Odion Ighalo. Ighalo, who bagged two goals in the 3-0 win over Derby County in the fifth round of the FA Cup, was a surprise acquisition by United from Shanghai Shenhua on a loan deal until the summer. The 30-year-old was a signing out of the blue but he has been solid for the Reds, scoring his first goal for the club in the 5-0 hammering of Club Brugge in the Europa League last Thursday. Ferdinand, who earlier expressed doubt on the player ahead of United’s clash at Derby County, now believes the addition is starting to make more sense. Ferdinand told BT Sport, “People and myself included were probably thinking Odion Ighalo, where does he fit into all of this? “If you have an opportunity to sign a player at the beginning of the January window, he is not the guy you are going to sign. “When the ball gets played into him (for the goal), if Rashford or Martial were there they wouldn’t have made themselves available like that. “To be there first is great considering the pressure he is under. He’s in the centre of the goal and he’s a physical presence. That’s what he adds to this team. “He should be (the number one trend). He scored two goals and he knows where the back of the net is. He is doing all the right things. What this gives United now is flexibility. They have someone to play off of.”
