Dayo Ojerinde The Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has called on the Federal Government to investigate the three recent explosions which occurred in the South-West. He noted that the explosions were beyond ordinary blasts as claimed by the government. Adams in a statement on Sunday said the latest blast in Akure, the Ondo State capital, might be a bomb blast that must be investigated. He said, “We are not convinced that all these are ordinary blasts, but a bomb and therefore it is important and necessary for the Federal Government to carry out an investigation on these incidents which occurred in the space of three weeks in Lagos, Ekiti and Ondo states. “With the Lagos blast and from records, a pipeline fire is expected to burn houses and not uprooting houses from the foundation. In view of that, it was beyond pipeline burst, but bomb blast.” He added that the Ekiti incident was of the same pattern, which should not be attributed to ordinary blast, stressing that the incidents were becoming rampant in the South-West. “The South-West governors should be vigilant. Information at our disposal has it that, other South-West states are the next target. The Federal Government should diligently investigate the incidents,” Adams said. Copyright PUNCH.
