Peter Dada, Akure A firm in Ondo State, the Ore Industrial Park, has expressed its ability to employ about 120,000 of youths in the park, which comprises many factories. The firm sited in Ore, in the Odigbo Local Government Area of Ondo State, was recently inaugurated by the President, Major General Mohammadu Buhari (retd). The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager of the park, Mr Femi Akinkuebi, said the project was in collaboration with the state government in a bid to industrialise the state and provide employment opportunities. According to him, the park was “targeting to employ not less than 120,000-strong workforce within the next 12 years.” He said, “Apart from providing employment, the park is to empower our people because there is one we are building now called production hub whereby you just need to bring your equipment. We have space for production in order to encourage our local people. “One of the things we are considering in the areas of Corporate Social Responsibility is to give direct employment to the people of Odigbo Local Government Area because we don’t believe in giving any money to individuals or group of people. What we are looking at is to empower them. Copyright PUNCH.
