Friday Olokor, Abuja A non-governmental organisation, Field Intelligence, has raised $3.6m equity to transform healthcare supply chain in Africa. The amount, according to a statement on Tuesday, was raised in partnership with Blue Haven Initiative, according to the Head of Growth Department in FI, Peter Bunor. He said the annual pharmaceuticals market in Africa had been valued at over $60bn. Bunor stated that for 80 per cent of people in Africa, their community pharmacy was the frontline of the health system. He described as sad the fact that many pharmacies were routinely out of essential medicines, incurred significant losses to expiration of drugs and struggle with substandard and falsified drugs. He said FI’s shelf life ‘Pay-as-you-sell’ subscription service for pharmaceutical products had grown rapidly since first debuting in Nigeria in mid 2017. “The new investment will fund shelf life’s expansion throughout Nigeria and Kenya, as well as the development of additional services for Shelf Life clients and their patients,” the statement added.
