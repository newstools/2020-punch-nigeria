Chukwudi Akasike and Sampson Itode Ex-Nigerian Ambassador to South Korea, Desmond Akawor, has been elected the new Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Rivers State. Akawor was elected by PDP delegates during the party’s state congress at the Obi Wali Cultural Centre in Port Harcourt on Saturday. Governor Nyesom Wike and  the National Chairman of the party,  Prince Uche Secondus, took part in  the congress. Wike called on Nigerians to mount pressure on the National Assembly to amend the Electoral Act to ensure credible elections in 2023. The governor  told  Akawor not to bring down the high standard of the party. He said, “Don’t allow the standard of the party in the state to come down because the party has given us the mandate, the template with which we ran elections and won. ‘’Our duty as those in authority is to continue to give the people of the state hope to continue to believe in the  PDP and that is why I challenge anybody today; if the Independent National Electoral Commission is to conduct proper elections any day, any time, nobody that wants to contest elections under the PDP that will not win in Rivers State because there are things to show.” Copyright PUNCH.
