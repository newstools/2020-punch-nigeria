Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Agbowu of Ogbaagba, Oba Dhikirullahi Akinropo, has dragged Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, before an Osun State High Court, demanding N100m damages for an alleged assault against him by the royal father. In a writ of summons dated 27th of February, 2020 issued by his counsel, Soji Oyetayo, detailing demands of Oba Akinropo, the claimant also asked for perpetual injunction restraining the defendant, his servants and or agents from committing further act of assault on him. The monarch is also asking the court to award N1m against the defendant as cost of hiring legal service for the action. Also in the writ supported by a 39 paragraphs statement of claims, Oba Akinropo alleged that the Oluwo attacked him at the AIG’s office in the presence of other monarchs and some members of the state executive council and inflicted injury on him which was later treated at the Osun State Specialist Hospital, Asubiaro, Osogbo. Six other monarchs from the three Local Government Areas, who claimed to have witnessed the faceoff also deposed to affidavits to testify on behalf of the Agbowu.

He said other monarchs and their subjects in the affected Local Government Areas disagreed with the directive, insisting that the Oluwo lacked the power to issue such directive. Copyright PUNCH.
