Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A commercial motorcyclist, whose identity could not be immediately ascertained, was on Sunday crushed to death by a truck in Osogbo, Osun State. The crash occurred at the popular Olaiya junction around 5.15pm, when a truck coming from the Ogo Oluwa end of the Gbongan/Osogbo Road ran over the motorcyclist, who was said to be waiting for the traffic light to give him the go-ahead to proceed to the MDS end of the road. A Toyota Camry car with four occupants was also damaged by the truck, but the occupants escaped unhurt. The crash caused gridlock on the busy Gbongan/Osogbo Road as many commuters were held in traffic for several hours. A shop owner at the Olaiya junction, Ola Adesegun, told our correspondent that immediately the crash occurred, the truck driver attempted to flee the scene, but he was caught and handed over to the police. He stated, “The crash occurred around 5.15pm when a truck coming from the Ogo Oluwa end ran over a commercial motorcyclist, who was waiting for the traffic light at the MDS end and killed him on the spot. “The two passengers being conveyed by the deceased at the time the accident occurred, however, escaped. “A Toyota Camry coming from the Odi Olowo end was also damaged by the truck.” When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the Osun State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Agnes Ogungbemi, confirmed the crash. She said a commercial motorcyclist was killed in the crash, adding that the FRSC personnel were working to clear the gridlock. ”Copyright PUNCH.
