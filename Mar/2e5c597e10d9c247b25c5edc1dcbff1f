Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The Chairman of the  South-East Governors’ Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, on Thursday told Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo that governors of the zone would soon unveil a security outfit for the zone, the way the South-West governors did in their zone. According to the governor, the South-East already had its own ‘Amotekun’, that would soon be launched for adequate security of lives and property. Umahi stated this in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital, during the commencement of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Clinics for viable enterprises in the state by the Vice-President.
