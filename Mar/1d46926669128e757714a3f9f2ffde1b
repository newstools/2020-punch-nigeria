Speaking on the sidelines of the screening at the fund’s headquarters in Abuja, the Head, Overseas Scholarship Scheme Division, PTDF, Bello Mustapha, said the screening of the shortlisted applicants would run for two weeks. He said, “We received over 25,000 applications and we shortlisted over 6,000 across the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria where the interviews will take place. We use panellists for the interviews. “We usually use 90 per cent of our old scholars that have graduated with a PhD, excellent scholars. They are the ones who are going to conduct the interviews. There are up to 91 panellists spread across the six geopolitical zones.” Mustapha noted that PTDF was partnering five countries in the scholarship scheme and named them as France, Germany, China, the United Kingdom and Malaysia. “For this year, we extended it to Malaysia because we have partnership with one of their universities,” he stated.
