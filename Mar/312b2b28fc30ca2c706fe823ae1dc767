Dillian Whyte says Anthony Joshua was “pretending” he wanted an all-British battle last year, but remains ready and willing if his bitter rival wants another grudge fight. The Brixton man was unable to agree terms for a Wembley fight with Joshua last April, insisting that the world champion had already decided to make his US debut in June against Jarrell Miller, the New Yorker who then failed a drug test and was replaced by Andy Ruiz Jr. Joshua regained his titles in a rematch win over Ruiz Jr in December, while Whyte is waiting for a WBC mandatory title shot in February 2021, and the south Londoner believes they can finally share the ring again, if the unified champion genuinely wants the fight. “I’ve been saying I want the rematch since the fight,” said Whyte, who defeated Joshua in the amateurs before a professional loss in 2015.

You guys gave Miller 20 weeks, why are you trying to give me seven weeks, because they weren’t serious about the fight. “Just using me as a scapegoat, pretending they wanted to make the fight. If he wants to fight, I’m here, he knows where I’m at. They know where my value is, I know the game inside out. If they want the fight, we can make the fight happen.”
