Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Governor of Oyo State, Mr Seyi Makinde, has sacked his Special Assistant on Digital Media, Muritala Adigun, for allegedly feeding the public with misleading information. His letter of termination of appointment, signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Olubamiwo Adeosun, with reference number: SP/S.662/2/Vol1/115, was reportedly handed over to him on Friday. The letter read in part, “I wish to convey the approval of His Excellency, Governor Seyi Makinde, on the termination of your appointment as Special Assistant (Digital Media), with immediate effect.” It was alleged that the sacked media aide had, on Thursday, posted false information about the procurement of some kits on his Facebook page, alleging that they were bought by the Oyo State Government. Sources said his action led to negative comments against the governor and the state government. Adigun, a.k.a Adigun Ibadan, posted the picture of some tools, reportedly procured by the Lagos State Government, on his Facebook page, with a claim that it was procured by the Oyo State Government.
