Ebenezer Bajela Leicester City are in the market to sign a replacement for Nigeria international, Wilfred Ndidi, who could make a move away from the club when the transfer market opens in the summer. According to Coliseo Verdiblanco, Real Betis midfielder, William Carvalho, is the man who could be saddled with the responsibility of filling the void should they lose Ndidi. Reports claim conversations have taken place about a deal, and whilst the move hasn’t been agreed, the Foxes are pressing ahead with their efforts to sign him. Brendan Rodgers is a huge fan of the Portuguese and he made efforts to bring him to Liverpool in 2015, and it is no surprise that he has showed interest in the 27-year-old again, with the possibility of losing his best defensive midfielder in mind. Leicester’s midfield struggled for most of the season without Ndidi after the 22-year-old picked up injuries, and Rodgers may now feel that Carvalho can offer some cover in that position. When Carvalho joined Betis from Sporting Lisbon in 2018, it was confirmed that he had a huge €120m release clause in his contract, as noted by Marca and it remained to be seen if Betis would be willing to accept below that price. Rodgers’ side won only one out of the six Premier League games that Ndidi did not feature in. Copyright PUNCH.
