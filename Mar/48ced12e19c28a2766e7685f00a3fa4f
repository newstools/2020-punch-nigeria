John Ameh, Abuja The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonanya Onu, has said the United States is conducting tests on a ‘chemical compound’ isolated by ex-Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Maurice Iwu, as a possible cure for coronavirus. He dismissed reports suggesting that Iwu had found a cure for the disease, adding that his initial finding was that the compound could cure SARS. Onu said,”They are testing it in the US to confirm whether this could be a cure for Covid -19 or SARS.” Copyright PUNCH.
