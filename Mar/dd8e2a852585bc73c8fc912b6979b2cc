Anna Okon The Nigerian Ports Authority and the management of the ApMoeller Terminal have met to find solution to the challenge of the Apapa port congestion and the perennial gridlock along the port access roads. This is coming after the NPA reportedly made moves to take over the APM Terminal because of the congestion. The General Manager, Corporate and Strategic Communications,Â  NPA, Mr Jatto Adams, told our correspondent that the top management of the terminal met with the NPA team on Monday and it was resolved that the congestion at the terminal must be addressed to stem the gridlock along the port access roads. The APM Terminal, he said, explained their current challenge with the access roads and efforts put in place to decongest the terminal. They said three pieces of handling equipment they ordered had arrived in Nigeria on Monday. Meanwhile, a former National President, Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agent, Olayiwola Shittu, said the NPA did well by allowing the terminal time to put structures in place to contain the congestion.
