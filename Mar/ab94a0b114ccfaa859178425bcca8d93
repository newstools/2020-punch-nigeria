Gibson Achonu, Owerri The Imo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party on Thursday said it had expelled the former senator of the Imo East Senatorial district (Owerri), Samuel Anyanwu. In an advert captioned, Expulsion of Senator Samuel Anyanwu,’ in one of the state tabloid addressed to the National Chairman of the party, dated March 5, 2020, the state Secretary of the party, Nze Ray Emeana, said his expulsion took effect from Monday, October 28, 2019. The advert partly read, “It was sequel to conclusive disciplinary procedure to this effect by his Amaimo ward and the Ikeduru Local Government Area of the party as well as the subsequent ratification by the Imo West senatorial zone executive and the state working committee.” When contacted, Anyanwu said had never appeared in any disciplinary committee. Responding, Anyanwu said, “This is an evil plan to undermine me. The perpetrators wanted to edge me out from the forthcoming PDP congress. They forgot so soon how the PDP was dead in the state and how I revived it with my money. I was the first to declare my intention to run for the governorship position in the state under the  party’s platform. I revived the PDP in the state with my money. As a national officer and member of the National Executive Committee, the state cannot expel me from the party without the clearance from the national secretariat.” Copyright PUNCH.
