Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Federal High Court in Ado Ekiti has cautioned parties in a suit filed by a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Michael Akinleye, against the nomination and appointment of a former Oyo State governor, Abiola Ajimobi, as the party’s deputy national chairman. Justice Uche Agomoh, who adjourned the matter till April 7 for hearing after listening to the counsel for the parties when the matter came up on Monday, cautioned them to “advise your clients not to do anything that will jeopardise the case in court.” Akinleye is, in the suit, marked FHC/AD/CS/8/2020, filed against the APC National Working Committee, urging the court to halt Ajimobi’s nomination and appointment on the premise that the position had been micro-zoned to Ekiti State. When the matter came up on Monday, counsel for Akinleye, Taiwo Omidoyin, drew the attention of the court to the fact that the APC national leadership, who were respondents in the case, had gone ahead to appoint and inaugurate Ajimobi as the deputy national chairman during the pendency of the suit. But counsel for the respondents, Chief Anthony Adeniyi, said the assertion of the claimant’s counsel was far from the truth. Copyright PUNCH.
