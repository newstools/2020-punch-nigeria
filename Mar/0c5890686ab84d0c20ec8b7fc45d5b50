Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The Department of State Services has denied allegations that it intimidated voters and officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission during the 2019 general elections. The agency said its actions during the elections were in line with the best global practices of maintaining peace and internal security of the country. It stated these in response to allegations by the United States Government that security agencies, including the DSS and Nigerian Army, worked for the success of the ruling All Progressives Congress in the election. These observations are contained in the 2019 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices released by the US Department of State on Wednesday. But debunking the report, the DSS Public Relations Officer, Peter Afunanya, in a terse message to The PUNCH, said the service carried out its line of duties professionally. “The DSS regularly sticks to its mandatory role of detecting and preventing crimes/threats against the internal security of Nigeria. “It was at the forefront of establishing the Interagency Consultative Committee on Electoral Security and ensured that elections in Nigeria were conducted in line with the electoral laws and that the exercises were conducted orderly,” Afunanya said. According to the 44-page report by the US, during the 2019 general elections, there were evidence military and security services intimidated voters, electoral officials and election observers. The report said, “In addition violence in several states contributed to lower voter participation and added to the sentiment the army is a tool of the ruling party in many parts of the country, particularly in the South.”
