Kelvin Ekerete Former Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, Jamie Redknapp, says the inclusion of ex-Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo and Portuguese midfielder, Bruno Fernandes have made Manchester United a better team. United have won six and drawn three of their last nine games across all competitions. Ighalo has scored three goals for the club in all competitions since making a late deadline day move to the club but is yet to find the back of the net in the English Premier League despite having some shots on target. “There was no doubting his ability. Even at Watford he showed glimpses and Ole obviously knew him, so they’re inspired signings and they’re the ones you want,” Redknapp told Sky sports. “If you’re building a team for the future, you’re not going to put Ighalo in it for the next five years but right now, as a stop-gap with Marcus Rashford injured, Ole needed somebody to come in and make a difference and against Derby, he was fantastic and took his second goal extremely well. “And that will give him a lot of confidence. Even if he doesn’t start, to come off the bench and make a difference, that’s what you need as a manager.” Redknapp said their inclusion in the team has helped shape the team’s mentality. “There were a lot of games I saw earlier in the season and I thought ‘these players aren’t at it, they’re not pulling their weight, they’re not pushing themselves’,” Redknapp said. “Now I’m watching them and they’re dictating the game, they’ve got a lot of possession, they look dangerous, and to a certain extent without Rashford, without Paul Pogba, people would have thought, well that’s their season over. But no.” .Copyright PUNCH.
