Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Vice-Chancellor, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Prof. Felix  Salako, has  refuted an  allegation of assassination levied against him by an expelled student of the institution,  Ifemosu Michael. The 31-year-old  200 level student was expelled from the institution after making some claims described by the university as false. The student took the institution   to court to challenge his expulsion. Few weeks after the case was filed, the former  student via  a video on social media alleged that the vice-chancellor was after his life. But Salako, while speaking with newsmen on Monday, said what Ifemosu  alleged as an assassination attempt, was a robbery incident which had been reported to the appropriate quarters. He said, “I  found the allegation of assassination allegedly instigated by me  according to Ifemosu Michael Adewale very traumatic as an academic, a father and a community development individual. “Other stakeholders are also usually engaged in dialogue to solve problems. However, we have noted that Ifemosu may be acting a script bigger than him in view of recent happenings on our campus.” The Vice Chancellor said he wished  to state that the  allegation might be a prelude to a sinister action to be unleashed on him by Ifemosu  and his cohorts. “I am not after Mr Ifemosu or anybody and will never be. The general public and all our stakeholders may wish to note that emerging facts indicate that what Mr Ifemosu reffered to as an assassination attempt orchestrated by Prof. Salako, a Vice-Chancellor, has also been reported as a robbery incident which took place in Apakila Camp area of Abeokuta on March 17, 2020 at about 1. 23am, he said.
