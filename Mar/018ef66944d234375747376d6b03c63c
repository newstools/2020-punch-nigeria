Patrick Odey, Uyo Teaching and non-teaching staff members of the Uyo City Polytechnic, a private polytechnic in Akwa Ibom State, have shut down the institution to protest against the non-payment of 21-month salary arrears. The aggrieved workers, as well as some residents of the host community, Nduetong Oku, in the Uyo Local Government Area, on Monday locked up the main gate of the institution. They displayed placards, some of which read, ‘We  need our 21-month salary, ‘we are very hungry,’ and ‘Etukudoh’s family should  honour agreement and  pay our salary.’ Hung at the gate is a notice by the polytechnic Rector, Mrs Idem Iboro, directing staff and students of the institution to proceed on a two-week break starting from Monday,  March 16, pending when the issues leading to the closure of the school will be resolved. When contacted, the rector said, “I came this morning and I saw the barricade, so I put up the notice. I am still investigating the matter.” However, a worker at the Department of Mass Communication,who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “Nobody is happy with the situation here because we have been owed for 21 months.” Copyright PUNCH.
