Samuel Awoyinfa Coronavirus may soon affect businesses in Africa, the President, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Adetokunbo Kayode, has said. He said this on Tuesday while hosting a business delegation from the European Union led by Gianioca Russo of Q and T, a statement from the ACCI said. Kayode,  who  said the disease  had started disrupting big economies, added that it might begin to affect businesses in Africa later this month. He said, “We commend the government for the ongoing drive to boost  the internal manufacturing and production capacity. We must do more, especially as Covid-19 is creating a challenge that may affect  the economic growth of many African nations. “That China is slowing down implies commodity and oil exporting nations are going to be hard hit. “Several reports from our members within and outside the country confirm that the peak of the impact of Covid-19 on global supply chains will occur in mid-March, forcing thousands of companies to throttle down or temporarily shut assembly and manufacturing plants in the US and Europe. “The impact may be more than envisaged, as many companies rely heavily or solely on factories in China for parts and materials.” Copyright PUNCH.
