Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja A former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, says Nigeria’s health care system cannot withstand a coronavirus pandemic on the scale of America and Europe. He, therefore, called on the government and the citizens to do everything to curb the spread of the virus. Tinubu said this in a statement he wrote in commemoration of his 68th birthday. The All Progressives Congress leader said, “The public health care systems of developed nations have been overwhelmed by this virus. They are running out of equipment and healthy doctors. “Our public health care system is much smaller and less equipped than those in Europe and North America. We cannot afford to put undue pressure on our system because it cannot bear the great weight of a pandemic. “Thus, it is incumbent on us to thoroughly implement and obey social safety and distancing techniques so that we halt the spread of the disease and keep hospitalization to the barest possible minimum.”
