’Tosin Oluwalowo As the 20th National Sports Festival takes centre stage in Benin City, Edo State from Sunday, host state, Edo and winner of the last edition Delta are engaged in war of words on which of the states would win the festival. Former Delta State sports commissioner, Solomon Ogba, boasted that they were poised to maintain their dominance of the fiesta. According to him, their grip on the top was not going to be broken by their neighbours, because the state has always developed athletes in sports, even outside preparing for the festival. “In Delta, we don’t do sports just because of the NSF, sport is a way of life for us, it is a daily thing. We have sports at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. We have training and competitions for our athletes regularly. After this NSF, we have the Delta State Inter-Local Government Championships. We also have a solid elite athlete development programme, so in Delta, sports is not a one-off thing, it is a way of life,” Ogba said in a statement. This did not however go down well with the Chairman, Edo State Sports Commission, Godwin Dudu-Orumen, who alleged that Delta used money to win medals at the festival. “Tell Ogba dollars won’t buy medals at Edo 2020. The sun has set for the underhand strategy of buying (technical) officials, referees and umpires to swing obvious results in favour of Delta state. He (Ogba) is advised to think more of competing and winning fairly,” Dudu-Orumen was quoted by newstap.com.ng. Delta amassed 163 gold, 88 silver and 101 bronze medals to win the 19th edition of the NSF in Abuja in 2018, while Edo finished third with 47 gold, 41 silver and 53 bronze medals, behind Rivers State in second position.
