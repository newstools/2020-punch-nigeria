Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has resolved to investigate satellite cable television service providers in Nigeria for refusing the calls by Nigerians to adopt ‘pay per view’ subscription plan. Members of the House took turns to particularly criticise Digital Satellite Television, a South Africa-based company owned by MultiChoice, for cheating its Nigerian subscribers by restricting them to prepaid plans. Consequently, the House resolved to set up an ad hoc committee to probe into the matter, with the mandate to invite Federal Government agencies regulating the industry, including the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy. At the plenary on Tuesday, the legislative chamber unanimously adopted a motion moved by Mr Unyime Idem, titled ‘Call on MultiChoice Digital Satellite Television (DSTV) and Other Service Providers to Introduce the Pay as You Go Tariff (PAYG) Plan.’ Copyright PUNCH.
