Ife Oyerinde With a Cumulative Grade Point Average of 3.93 out of a possible 4.0, Ms Nkechi Alexandra Kingsley – has emerged the overall best graduating student of the Lagos State Polytechnic. She  has got an automatic employment offer to work in the school from Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Ms Kingsley, who finished from the Department of Chemical Engineering, got the offer from the governor at the 27th convocation of the polytechnic on Thursday at the Ikorodu campus. Sanwo-Olu, who is the school’s moderator, charged the graduates to see their periods of learning in the polytechnic as more than just an effort to obtain certificates. He said, “Technical education must never be seen as playing second fiddle to university education; both must be seen as equally-placed alternatives for young people on the journey to a productive future. My administration will not allow the Lagos State Polytechnic to lag behind in any way.” The Rector, Mr Samuel Sogunro, said the timely release of the school’s subvention and continuous investment in infrastructure by successive administrations in the state had increased its Webometrics ranking as the 5th Best Polytechnic in the country.
