Nike Popoola The Lagos State Government says it has paid N1.8bn accrued pension rights for pastÂ  civil servants into the Retirement Savings Account of 418 retirees. The payment was made from the mainstream civil service, Local Governments, State Universal Basic Education and Teaching Service Commission for the month of March, 2020. A statement said the Director-General, Lagos State Pension Commission, Mrs Folashade Onanuga, said the mode of distribution of bond certificates for the month was different from the norm. This was based on the directives given by the state Governor, Babajide Sanwoolu, to limit large gatherings in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19 virus. According to her, all bond certificates for March had been released to the Pension Fund Administrators that would invite beneficiaries in their tens for the exit meeting and grant access to their RSA for computation of their lump sum and monthly pension. She also released contact phone numbers and e-mail addresses for all retirees and contributors in Lagos State public service to channel any enquiry on pension matters during this period. Onanuga advised retirees to scan and send any document to the agency. She urged all retirees to stay safe and observe all necessary precautions needed to stay free of the virus. Copyright PUNCH.
