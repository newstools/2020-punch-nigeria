Kelvin Ekerete Nigeria striker should be awarded Manchester United’s Player of The Month for March, according to United in-house journalist, Sam Carney. The quartet, Bruno Fernandes, (Odion) Ighalo, Harry Maguire and Fred have been nominated for the award which will be disclosed on Saturday (today). Despite the form of fellow new-signing, Bruno Fernandes, Fred, and the form of club captain, Harry Maguire, Carney believes the former Watford man has a greater claim to the prize than all three. Ighalo is the team’s leading goalscorer in the month where football activities were truncated due to the COVID 19 pandemic, notching three times in his two starts, against Derby County in the Emirates FA Cup and LASK in the Europa League. The striker also had brief but bountiful cameo appearances at Goodison Park and in the Manchester derby, with a performance that will always be remembered by the fans. “In March we travelled to Derby in the FA Cup and, although much of the pre-match focus was on former Red Wayne Rooney, it was to be Odion’s night at Pride Park. “In our final outing of the month, in the eerie surroundings of the empty Linzer Stadion, Ighalo then netted his finest goal yet for the Reds. That strike set us on the way to a 5-0 win. “With his performance in the month, it looks as if Ighalo had done everything he could in March to establish himself as United’s first-choice forward. This is why he gets my nod for Player of the Month,” he concluded. Copyright PUNCH.
