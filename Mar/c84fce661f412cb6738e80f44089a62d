Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja Jumia Nigeria has delisted 390 products belonging to 168 sellers of hand sanitisers and face masks from its platform. The move followed a warning issued by the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to sellers engaged in arbitrary increase in prices of protective and hygiene products in the wake of the recent outbreak of coronavirus. This was contained in a communication received by the Chief Executive Officer, FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera, from the Chairwoman, Nigeria and Head of Institutional Affairs, Jumia Group, Juliet Anammah. The letter read in part, “Let me reconfirm that at Jumia, we want to work with your agency, most especially at a critical time like this. “About 390 products belonging to 168 sellers of sanitisers and face masks have been delisted. “Unfortunately, this is an ongoing process as sellers can relist products. Thus, we will be doing hourly checks and clean up if necessary. “ The FCCPC said this was the second time Jumia would be responding to its warning in the last one week. The FCCPC, on February 29, had warned suppliers and retailers of safety and protective apparel such as face masks and latex gloves, as well as personal hygiene products including sanitizers and anti-bacterial wipes against increasing their prices. The warning became imperative following the high demand for these products due to the need to prevent infection or spread of the coronavirus. Copyright PUNCH.
