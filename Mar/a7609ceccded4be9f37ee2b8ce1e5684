Kelvin Ekerete Trabzonspor have slammed midfielder, Mikel Obi, for being selfish, after the club parted ways with the Nigerian with his contract getting terminated after just nine months with the Turkish League leaders. Mikel has since returned to England to be with his family after the chaos and has vowed in an interview with The Atlantic not to return to the club due to the management’s poor handling of his opinion to cancel the Turkish Super Ligue due to COVID19 pandemic. Trabzonspor in a statement have slammed the Nigerian for being untruthful in his interviews saying the club had taken precautionary methods to keep players and staff safe. “Mikel’s claim regarding our club does not reflect the truth. As Trabzonspor Club, we have taken all our precautions against Covid-19 in a short time,” Trabzon based website 61saat.com reported.
