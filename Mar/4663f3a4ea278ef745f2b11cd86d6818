Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Governors’ Mandate Network has called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to intervene in the crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress in Edo State. The crisis in the state chapter of the APC has factionalised the party into two separate groups with one loyal to Governor Godwin Obaseki; and the other loyal to the National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole. Obaseki, who enjoyed Oshiomhole’s support to emerge the state governor, has been accusing the former governor of attempts to undermine him. Members of Oshimhole camp have also accused the governor of highhandedness among others. But the GMN, in a statement by its chairman, Osaro Onaiwu, in Abuja on Monday asked Buhari to caution Oshiomhole. Onaiwu said, “We are appealing to the President to caution Oshiomhole. He is distracting our governor from doing the work he was elected to do. “The governor has revived what were abandoned by the previous governments, he should be supported and encouraged to do what he was elected to do. “This distraction will not help the state. When Oshiomhole was the governor, nobody distracted him; he was allowed to do his work. We know how he fought those who were alleged to be godfathers in the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
