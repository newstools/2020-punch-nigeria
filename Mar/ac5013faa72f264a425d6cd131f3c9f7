’Tosin ’Oluwalowo Enyimba coach, Fatai Osho, has alleged that Guinean side Horoya, used chemical substance on his players in their 2-0 loss in the CAF Confederations Cup on March 8 in Conakry. Osho stated this in a video he shared on his Facebook page. The loss ensured Enyimba, who had played a 1-1 draw with Horoya a week earlier in Aba, were dumped out in the quarter-final stage of the Confederations Cup. “A complete disgrace. A team incapacitating her opponents through chemical agents during a match. This is absolutely unbelievable. I still can’t believe the shameful desperation of this Horoya team. Waiting for CAF position on it though,” Osho wrote on Facebook. “If quick measures are not taken, they might ignorantly kill one of their opponents in their bid to be successful. We scooped that Enyimba FC is the third team to suffer this agonising fate in Horoya AC hands. “It was actually the Horoya AC players that perpetrated this act alongside the ball boys who hold these things for them. They capitalise on the opportunity of throw-in and corner-kicks to get it into the field to drop on opposing players. “It is called ‘werepe’ in Yoruba language. No player will have this on his body and be able to perform and concentrate again. I still find it difficult to believe till this moment. They are a bunch of fraud and cheap people,” Osho added.
