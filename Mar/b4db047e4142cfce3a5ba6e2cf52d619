Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The National Identity Management Commission on Thursday ordered the immediate shutdown of all its enrollment centres. According to the commission, the move is part of the measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The commission said all its centres in Lagos, Ekiti, Ogun, Katsina and Anambra states had been ordered to shut down. The Head, Corporate Communications, NIMC, Kayode Adegoke, said the move became necessary to prevent the commission’s staff and applicants from getting more vulnerable to the pandemic. “Consequently, all enrollment activities, card collection and other identity related activities are hereby suspended in the aforementioned states till further notice,” the NIMC stated. It said the closure was not intended to create panic but to arrest the spread of the disease, which had become a global threat. Adegoke said the commission regretted the inconvenience this might cause the public. Copyright PUNCH.
