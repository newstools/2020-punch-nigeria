The management on Sunday stated on its Instagram page that only a part of Eko Signature and Eko Hotel and about five others of its facilities would be open during the period. It said its spa, gym, pool, conference and banquet facilities, among others, would be temporarily closed.  The hotel, in a statement, said, “It is with great difficulty, but with the safety of you and our community in mind, that we have made the decision to temporarily close our Eko Suites Hotel, Eko Gardens Hotel, 88 Restaurant, Lagos Irish Pub, Sky Restaurant, My Thai Restaurant, Red Chinese Restaurant, Crossroads, the spa, gym, pool, and conference and banquet facilities. “However, part of Eko Signature and Eko Hotel, as well as Kuramo Sports Cafe, Calabash Bar, Lagoon Breeze, 1415 Seafood and Steakhouse are still operational.” It was also gathered from sources at the hotel that the partial closure necessitated by the coronavirus outbreak and expected drop in sales was an opportunity for the management of the company to carry out some renovations. It was learnt that workers in the closed sections had been asked to go on compulsory annual leave and that the partial closure would last for about three weeks or more.
