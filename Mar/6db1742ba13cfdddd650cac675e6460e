Ebenezer Bajela A French publication, Le 10 Sport, has predicted that Nigeria’s Victor Osimhen could become the most expensive player sold by French Ligue 1 club Lille in the future. With growing interests from European giants Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham, the French publication is confident that Lille could be forced to sell the youngster for a fortune. Osimhen joined the French outfit from Sporting Charleroi for €12m in August 2019 and still has another four-and-a-half-year left on his contract. With his current form for Les Dogues, where he has scored 13 goals from 27 league matches, the club could make a windfall on the player during the next transfer market. The €80m paid by Arsenal for Nicolas Pepe is currently the highest money ever received by the club but the sale of Osimhen has been tipped to better that fee. The French publication is of the opinion that the 21-year-old could be sold for around €100m. “After having received proposals a few weeks after his arrival, the LOSC will most certainly sell Victor Osimhen for a fortune. The biggest transfer in club history is organised,” Le 10 Sport wrote on their website. “This time, the sum that all these clubs could spend to snatch Victor Osimhen could be much higher than that which revolved around Nicolas Pépé, while a transfer to around €100m is more than ever mentioned for the Nigerian striker. It remains to be seen who will be ready to pay such a sum.” Copyright PUNCH.
