’Femi Asu Dangote Industries Limited said on Sunday that its subsea gas pipeline project would unlock significant gas supply for industrial activities and reduce flaring in Nigeria. The pipeline project is part of Dangote’s multibillion-dollar gas pipeline, fertiliser, petrochemicals and refinery projects, according to a statement issued by the company. The company said the 1,100-kilometre pipeline would be capable of handling three billion standard cubic feet of gas per day. It said the pipeline would help feed its fertiliser plant and connect the Niger Delta to Lekki Free Trade Zone in Lagos. According to the statement, the subsea pipeline is expected to create a corridor for evacuation of trapped gas from offshore platforms in Nigeria to make for the monetisation of the product. It said the pipeline project would make gas readily available for commercial use and nullify the need for future gas imports. The company said it would lead to diversification of the country’s economy, increase government revenue, meet demand for domestic petrochemical products, and ensure an increase in foreign exchange from exports. The Group Executive Director, Strategy, Capital Projects and Portfolio Development, DIL, Mr Devakumar Edwin, described the pipeline as the largest subsea pipeline infrastructure in the world. Edwin said the gas pipeline project would guarantee uninterrupted power supply to Dangote refinery and petrochemical plants on completion, which he said would also positively increase the country’s Gross Domestic Product.
