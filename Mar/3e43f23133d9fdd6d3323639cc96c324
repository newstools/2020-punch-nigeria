Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Primate of the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh, has warned leaders to guard against tribalism and ethnicity, saying they are two evils prevalent in society. The outgoing Primate, who stated this on Sunday, added that if the country and the church did not deal with the evils, they would disorganise the system. Okoh gave the advice in his valedictory sermon at a thanksgiving service at the Cathedral Church of the Advent, Life Camp, Abuja, where he also warned members of the House of Bishops not to allow tribalism and ethnicity to fester in their locations. According to a statement, Okoh said in 10 years as the leader of Anglican Church in Nigeria, he was also accused of promoting ethnicity and tribalism. He said, “The greatest weapon of the wolves in the Nigerian context is tribalism and ethnicity.  I should know because for 10 years, I have been struggling with it. If I drink water, then they will accuse you of tribalism. Fortunately, my tribe does not really exist for them to say that I have supported this or that. “If the Church of Nigeria does not kill tribalism, it is likely to disorganise the balance completely. If the bishops fail to kill tribalism, it is going to destroy our church. If you don’t stand strong and enforce oneness, it is going to destroy the diocese and the church around you.” Okoh will be succeeded by Archbishop Henry Ndukuba, the Primate-elect, who until his election in September 2019, was the Bishop of Gombe Diocese and Archbishop of Jos Province of the Anglican Communion. ”Copyright PUNCH.
