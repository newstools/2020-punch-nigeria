Dele Ogunyemi, Warri Two riot policemen from the Mopol 41 in Gombe State, were on Wednesday shot dead by gunmen at a popular nightclub, the Club 316, by the Old Ekete junction in the Udu Local Government Area of Delta State. The attack, which occurred in the early hours of Wednesday, also left a civilian dead, while the hoodlums escaped with the rifles of the deceased policemen. Our correspondent gathered that the incident occurred around 12.30am as the gunmen shot in the air to scare away clubbers. Sources said the two policemen, Inspector Jafar Adamu and Sergeant Andrew Musa, were in Delta State on special duty and were shot dead during a gun duel with the hoodlums, who overpowered them. The Udu Local Government Area, which shares boundaries with the Uvwie and Warri South local government areas, has been home to suspected cultists and Internet fraudsters. When contacted, the Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Hafiz Inuwa, confirmed the incident, saying the command was working with members of the public to arrest the fleeing gunmen.
