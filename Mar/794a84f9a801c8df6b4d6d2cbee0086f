As part of the preventive measures against the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the Lagos State Government says it will close down all public and private schools from Monday, March 23, 2020. A statement by the government on Wednesday said the move became necessary to prevent “our children and their teachers from getting more vulnerable to the pandemic.” It added, “It is important for parents to ensure that their children practise social distancing while at home; wash their hands regularly or use hand sanitisers and observe high standard of personal hygiene. Children should be encouraged to remain at home.” The government stated further that the closure was not intended to create panic, but to arrest the spread of the disease, which had become a global threat. “The incident command centre, headed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, will continue to trace all contacts of the identified cases and encourage anyone who has information about suspected cases to report to the nearest hospital or call  the emergency telephone numbers: 08023169485, 08033565529, 08052817243 and 08023401214,” the statement added.
