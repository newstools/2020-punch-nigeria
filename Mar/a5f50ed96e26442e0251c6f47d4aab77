Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi As part of activities to mark the 2020 International Women’s Day, stakeholders have called for gender balance in aviation. The Group Managing Director, Nigerian Aviation Handling Company Plc, Mrs Olatokunbo Fagbemi, at an event to mark the day, said more women were needed in the aviation industry to create balance. She said there were plans to go to schools and encourage young women to consider career in aviation. She said, “We want to get enough women in aviation at the senior level and go to schools around Lagos and talk to the girls. We will also reach out to the younger girls so they can understand what the aviation industry is all about and start showing some interest. “We want them to understand that it is more than being a pilot or air hostess; it also involves working on the aircraft, working with cargo, providing safety services, being a regulator and air traffic management amongst other things. So, there is a place for everyone.” The General Manager, Public Affairs, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, said women representation in aviation was low, adding that the target should be 50-50. Speaking on the fight against coronavirus, she said in all international and domestic airports FAAN had put measures in place for prevention. Yakubu said, “I just came back from Germany and there were no checks there but I can tell you that in the aircraft to Lagos, we were given forms to fill. “When I came back, they refused to clear me because they insisted that I must write the number of my flat on the form. We are doing a lot better than some other countries.” Copyright PUNCH.
