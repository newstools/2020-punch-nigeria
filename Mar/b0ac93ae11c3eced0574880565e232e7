Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The newly appointed Director-General of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, Capt. Musa Nuhu, on Monday took over the affairs of the regulatory agency. The new DG during a brief handover ceremony presided over by the acting Director General, Capt. Sidi Abdullahi, said new ideas and suggestions from staff aimed at making things work seamlessly were needed in the agency and the industry at large. While commending the Federal Government for the confidence in him, he urged staff to brace up for challenges ahead arising from COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Government had in October 2019 appointed Nuhu, Nigeriaâ€™s representative in the International Civil Aviation Organisation Council as the new NCAA DG to take over from Capt. Muhtar Usman whose tenure ended at that time. According to a statement by the General Manager, Public Relations of the NCAA, Sam Adurogboye, Nuhu resumed as the seventh DG of the agency.
