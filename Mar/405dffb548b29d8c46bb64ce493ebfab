Success Nwogu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party on Monday urged the leadership of the National Assembly to resist all pressures to pass the anti-social media bill, which it said is anti-people and unconstitutional. The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement called on Nigerians, including the media, organised civil society and all pro-democracy groups, to unite against moves to pass the anti-social media bill at the NASS. He said, “The PDP said it is time for Nigerians to eschewed all political, sectional and religious differences and stand in unity against a bill that is clearly designed to suppress and silence the people, emasculate institutions of democracy, particularly the media, take away the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech of citizens and turn them into conquered people without a voice, in their own country.
