Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The Kogi State Government has redirected its request for $100m loan request from the World Bank to the African Development Bank. Addressing journalists in Lokoja on Thursday, the state Commissioner for Information and Communication Strategy, Kingsley Fanwo, said insinuations in some quarters that the state government had dropped the idea of the loan were “far from the truth,” saying government only redirected its request to the AfDB. Fanwo said the loan, which had been approved by the National Assembly, was aimed at positioning Kogi and Nigeria as the food corridor of Africa and an industrial hub. The commissioner added that the decision of the state to move the deal to the AfDB was in the best economic interest of the state. Copyright PUNCH.
