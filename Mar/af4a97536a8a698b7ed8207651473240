Afeez Hanafi The Court of Appeal, Benin City, Edo State, has upheld the death sentence of Mrs Enobong Isonguyo, who connived with her lover, Pastor Udoka Ukachukwu, to kill her husband, Victor. Isonguyo and Ukachukwu had been sentenced to death by an Edo State high court for conspiring to kill Victor. The woman appealed the ruling. At the hearing of the appeal, Defence Counsel, Olayiwola Afolabi, argued that the murder was not successfully proved at the lower court and urged the appellate court to quash the conviction. But the prosecution led by the Solicitor-General and Permanent Secretary, Edo State Ministry of Justice, Oluwole Iyamu (SAN), argued that “all the elements of murder were copiously established by the direct evidence of the appellant as well as evidence of the IPO, other police officers and other witnesses who testified for the state.” Iyamu further urged the court to dismiss the appeal and uphold the judgment of the lower court. The court in its judgment delivered on March 26, 2020 dismissed the appeal in its entirety and upheld the conviction of the appellant. Copyright PUNCH.
