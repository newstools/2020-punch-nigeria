Speaking on the economic output, the President, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Adetokunbo Kayode, said that to unlock the potential of the manufacturing sector said that the government must continue to collaborate with the private sector to stimulate the manufacturing sector. He also said the attention currently being paid to crude oil should be reduced while efforts should be focused on developing the crude oil value chain. He said, “Our GDP will continue to go up if we continue to place less emphasis on oil. Why did we go into recession? It was because the price of crude oil was going down. It’s not that we are not productive as a country but we need to take our eyes away from crude oil. We need to emphasise opportunities and open new doors. “We are not a poor country because we are potentially rich. We are depending on crude oil without focussing on the oil value chain, we import diesel, petrol and petrochemicals. “This is unbelievable. What is difficult in turning these into opportunities for people. Let’s leave oil where it is, develop the value chain and stimulate our manufacturing sector.” He added that it was important that the government continued to engage with the private sector to enhance economic development.
