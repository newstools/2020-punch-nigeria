The Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Dr Obafemi Hamzat, on Sunday said materials for the repair of the Alaka Bridge linking Eko Bridge were being assembled. Hamzat gave the update in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Ikeja. The portion linking Alaka and the Eko Bridge was closed to traffic on March 10, 2020, because some bearings on the bridge had gone bad. Hamzat reiterated that the closure became necessary to save lives because of the state of the bearings. The deputy governor stated that the damaged components were not accessories that could easily be purchased and had to be imported. He said, “Structural components on the Alaka Bridge will be fixed; that is what will happen; but until we change the expansion joints, the bridge will not be opened to articulated vehicles; maybe to cars and the rest. “We are working with the Federal Government. It has ordered the components but with all these shutdowns because of coronavirus, we do not know how long it is going to take to bring them in, but the materials have been ordered. “The materials are done to specifics; some were purchased for the Third Mainland Bridge but unfortunately, they are not something that we can just switch.” Hamzat added that the state government was collaborating with the Federal Government to ensure that all federal roads in the state were in good condition. On road maintenance, the deputy governor said constant investment and collaboration with the private sector was the best option to sustain infrastructural renewal in the state. ”Copyright PUNCH.
