…he’s chasing shadows-Issa-Onilu John Alechenu, Abuja The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress Mr. Yekini Nabena, on Sunday announced himself as the party’s acting National Publicity Secretary. He explained that his action was based on a subsisting court order issued by a Sokoto High Court restraining the party from appointing or electing “Mallam Lanre Isa-Onilu or any member” into office except through a National Convention as enshrined in the APC constitution. A Sokoto High Court had last week issued an interim injunction following an application filed by the APC National Vice Chairman (North West), Inuwa Abdulkadir. Specifically, the APC national vice chairman urged the court to restrain its spokesman from functioning in that capacity pending the determination of the substantive suit In a statement announcing his takeover, Nabena said, “APC is a law-abiding party and as leaders of the party we must be seen doing the right thing at all time, including respecting the order of the court. In lieu of this, Mallam Onilu has begun the process of vacating the order of the Sokoto High Court restraining him but pending the time this will be done I will act in his position. “Unlike the former ruling party, APC has high regard for the judiciary and we must be seen at all time practice what we preach.” However, reacting to the development, the APC National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu dismissed Nabena’s statement. He said, “There’s no such court judgement restraining me. He’s just chasing shadows. I’ll speak to it soon.”
