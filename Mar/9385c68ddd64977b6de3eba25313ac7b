The communique, which was sighted by The PUNCH, was read on behalf of the leaders by the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki. The communique noted in part, “At the meeting, the leaders of the zone deliberated extensively on situation in the party and at the end of the meeting, they adopted the following resolutions: “That as a party, we commend our brother, the Acting Chairman of the APC,  Victor Giadom, for rising to the occasion by providing leadership for the party in this trying times. “That we fully support the convening of the National Executive Committee meeting on Tuesday, March 17th, as the NEC is the only recognised organ under the constitution of our party to resolve the APC crisis. “That we insist that the party should respect the current zoning arrangement by retaining the chairmanship of our great party in the South-South zone even in an acting capacity. “We resolved that the most senior officer of the party from the zone, being the National Acting Secretary, Chief Victor Giadom, should be confirmed  Acting National Chairman for the time being. “We urged all our brothers and sisters from the zone to fully embrace the NEC meeting and not boycott the emergency NEC meeting, which has been slated for Tuesday, March 17th.
