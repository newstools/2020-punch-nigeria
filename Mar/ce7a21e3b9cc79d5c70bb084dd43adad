The statement said Adesina’s keynote speech showed his passion for the continent was palpable, connecting with the attentive audience throughout his speech. He expressed his humility, saying, “Recognised for my very modest achievements and contributions to Africa. Humbled to be nominated by what I gather to be 60 per cent of the votes cast by some one million people, humbled to be at the helm of an organisation that is making a tremendous difference across Africa – the African Development Bank. An organisation that is daily making prosperity a reality.” He dedicated the award to his wife, Grace, the board, staff, and colleagues at the bank, his mother, and “to the young mothers, struggling to bring up a child, to the farmer in search of a better tomorrow, to the youth of Africa longing for a better future, and to Africa’s journalists who risk their lives in helping to tell Africa’s true story.” Copyright PUNCH.
