Ifeoluwa Oyerinde The Lagos State Government has promised to invest in the development of infrastructure and improve the global competitiveness of artisans. The Lagos State Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment, Mrs Yetunde Arobieke, spoke during the commencement of the 10th edition of the Tradesmen and Artisans’ Capacity Building Programme, a statement said on Sunday. “This training programme is the upskilling of 500 artisans across different vocations in the state, and it is a clear demonstration of our commitment to continually improve the quality of our artisans for global competitiveness,’’ Arobieke said. The commissioner expressed the desire of the state government to equip tradesmen and artisans towards becoming 21st century artisans in line with the THEMES agenda of the present administration. “The members of the informal sector are the engines that drive the economy; hence it is important for Lagos artisans to work towards the realisation of a common purpose which is building a vibrant informal sector for sustainable economic growth,’’ Arobieke said. She added that the training scheduled to hold for eight weeks would expose the beneficiaries to latest trends and innovations, as well as equipment needed in their various vocations to continue to remain relevant among their contemporaries. The Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mrs Boladele Dapo-Thomas, said the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund was positioned to strategically empower entrepreneurs, increase their access to finance and create inclusive and sustainable policies and standards.
