The Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers has postponed its professional examination for March 2020 diet earlier scheduled for the end of the month and early April. A statement signed by the Registrar and Chief Executive, Mr Adedeji Ajadi, said the institute’s annual general meeting which holds yearly in April and other activities would be decided later. “Following the spread of the global pandemic, Covid-19 to over 140 countries including Nigeria, and the directives issued by the Federal and State Governments to curtail its spread, it has become necessary for the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers to review its programmes and events. “To this end, in the overriding interest of the safety and well-being of all our stakeholders and in support of the proactive measures taken by the Nigerian authorities. “CIS hereby postpones its professional examination for March 2020 diet, at all examination centres nationwide, earlier scheduled to hold between March 31 and April 2. “Information regarding the 25th annual general meeting of the Institute and other events will be communicated as events unfold.” It added that aside from the examination, the institute had also put on hold all trainings as each event would attract more than 50 participants. This was at variance with the government’s directive in a bid to prevent further spread of coronavirus in Nigeria, it stated.
