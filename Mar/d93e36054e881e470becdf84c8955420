John Charles, Makurdi Property worth millions of naira was destroyed in an early morning fire that gutted the Otukpo Main Market in Benue State on Monday. Our correspondent gathered that the fire, which started around 5am, destroyed hundreds of shops. Though firefighters were said to have responded promptly to a distress call, the clumsy nature of the market prevented them from gaining entry. An eyewitness, Ankeli Amanyi, told our correspondent that the incident made it the seventh time that fire had ravaged the market in the past 20 years. Amanyi said, “Over 1,000 shops were burnt in the fire, which started around 5am this morning (Monday). “No one can say for certain what caused the fire; we just noticed thick smoke from the market, which drew the attention of people to the area. “Actually, firefighters responded promptly but there was little they could do to extinguish the fire. The nature of the market did not allow vehicles to enter the market “This incident makes it the seventh time that the market would be razed in the last 20 years.” When contacted, the Director, Benue State Fire Service, Ikyaaza Donald, confirmed the incident and said his men responded promptly to extinguish it.
