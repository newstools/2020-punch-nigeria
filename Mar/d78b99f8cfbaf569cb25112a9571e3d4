Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Federal Government has received the strategic document for the stabilisation of areas destroyed by the Boko Haram sect within the Lake Chad region. The region which comprised part of Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, has been the epicentre of Boko Haram attacks and wanton destruction in the last 10 years. Reviewing the document in Abuja on Monday after receiving it from the Executive Secretary of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, Amb. Mamman Nuhu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, said the document would help the region to have a harmonised programme for implementation at various levels. The document which had input from all the development partners, including the United Nations and the African Union, was expected to provide a well-coordinated structure for the development of the areas negatively impacted by insurgency in the four countries. Onyeama stated, “The humanitarian, military, security challenge of the Lake Chad basin region is something that impacts very harshly on the four Lake Chad countries, namely Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon. “The purpose of this campaign is to sensitise not only actors within those four countries but also our partners- multinational partners, United Nations, African Union and bilateral partners to the efforts that are being made to coordinate the stabilisation objectives of those four countries, harmonise the programmes at the various levels and this is very important and excellent development.” Nuhu said the scale of the challenge in Lake Chad was daunting but not insurmountable, stressing that collaboration and synergy were needed.
