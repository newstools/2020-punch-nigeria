Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Senate has appealed to the board and management of the Petroleum Product Pricing Regulatory Agency to rescind its decision to sack 31 graduates who worked as temporary staff in the agency. The affected workers had through their lawyer, Uche Ayogu, petitioned the Senate to protest against their forceful disengagement from the PPPRA. The petition explained that 34 workers that served as youth corps members in the PPPRA were engaged in 2012 on a contract of six months, subject to renewal. They were, however, disengaged verbally in 2017. But the Chairman, Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions, Senator Ayo Akinyelure, appealed to the PPPRA to find a way of absorbing the sacked casual workers. Ayogu, had also told the Senate panel that the 34 casual workers were engaged for six months subject to renewal but added that after working for about seven years, they were disengaged verbally. He said, “One of the disengaged persons went to court. That was only one out of 34. One person is death. “None of them was found wanting in the course of their job. These people ought to be in the first priority list if there should be recruitment,” the lawyer said. However, the Human Resources Manager of PPPRA, Yusuf Muazu, said three out of the 34 graduates who met the agency’s criteria for employment had been employed. But the chairman of the Senate committee, who said some of the casual workers had been trained, urged PPPRA to reabsorb them. Copyright PUNCH.
