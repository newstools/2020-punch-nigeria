Tobi Aworinde, Abuja The spread of the coronavirus across more than 100 countries now qualifies as a global pandemic,  the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday. According to the WHO, a pandemic is “the worldwide spread of a new disease.” The  New York Times said   the WHO  had avoided using the term to describe the epidemic spreading across the world, “for fear of giving the impression that it was unstoppable and countries would give up on trying to contain it.” The organisation said earlier  that it no longer officially declared when an epidemic reached pandemic proportions, preferring instead to declare global public health emergencies. The Director General of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who spoke at a news conference in Geneva, said, “Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. “We cannot say this loudly enough or clearly enough or often enough. All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.” Meanwhile, five new countries and territories, including Brunei Darussalam, Mongolia, Cyprus, Guernsey and Panama, have recorded their first cases of COVID-19. The WHO, in a situation report on the coronavirus outbreak published on its website on Tuesday, noted that there were 109 countries, territories or areas with laboratory-confirmed cases of the deadly disease. The United Nations agency also put the global death toll from the new coronavirus disease at 4,012. According to the WHO, the number of COVID-19 deaths in China is 3,140 and 872 outside the Asian country. The number of confirmed cases globally has risen to 113,702, including 80,924 in China and 32,778 outside China. Copyright PUNCH.
