John Ameh, Abuja Wife of the President, Mrs Aisha Buhari, has called for a total lockdown of activities across the country as coronavirus toll hits 36 with one death recorded on Monday. Mrs Buhari specifically cited the case of state governors shutting down schools but allowing their parents to continue going to work. She noted that much as the move by the governors was commendable, it could be counterproductive if the parents continued to report for work. Taking to her twitter handle, @aishambuhari, she tweeted, “It is commendable that state governors have closed down schools; however, this could be counterproductive if parents are still going to work. “We should not isolate students and expose their parents. “Let us remember that they will meet at home. “#TotalLockDown “#StayAtHome.” The PUNCH reports that one of the President’s daughters, who recently returned from the United Kingdom, is in self-isolation on the advice of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Mrs Buhari had announced the development by herself last week.
