Olaide Oyelude, Katsina The Katsina State Police Command has launched a manhunt for nine men, who allegedly raped a 10-year-old girl repeatedly at the Maigora village in the Faskari Local Government Area of the state. The spokesman for the command, SP Gambo Isah, confirmed the development on Wednesday. “I want to confirm that the police have taken over the investigation and efforts are on to arrest the suspects,” he stated. Although details about the victim and the circumstances surrounding the incident had yet to be released due to ongoing investigation, it was learnt that the suspects were all married. It was also gathered that the victim’s father discovered the crime and reported it to community leaders before the police intervened. Attempts to get his comments on the incident were unsuccessful as enquiries were directed to the community leaders, who insisted that only the police could speak on it. The victim’s whereabouts were also being protected. Copyright PUNCH.
