Matthew Ochei, Asaba A 2019 Batch ‘A’ corps member, Olayinka Emmanuel, who contracted Lassa fever in Asaba, the Delta state capital, was full of praise during the passing out parade in Asaba on Thursday. Emmanuel was rushed to the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba, a month ago by his colleagues, where he received first aid before he was referred to the Emergency Unit of the Specialist Hospital, Irrua, in Edo State. The following day, rumour had it that he died of the disease. But glittering in his fully-kitted NYSC regalia at the Cenotaph on Thursday Yinka, as his fondly called by his friends, said, “Here I am, I am alive.” He said since the rumour had gone round that he was dead and he survived, all would work together for long life and prosperity for him. He said, “I give all thanks to God for keeping me alive, even though rumour spread that I was dead. All glory to God that now I am better and in perfect health. “I want to thank the state NYSC Coordinator, the CMD of FMC Asaba, the CMD of Irrua Specialist Hospital and my fellow corps members who rushed me immediately to the FMC. Now, I am passing out in good health.” In her address, the state Coordinator, Mrs Olutayo Samuel, who glorified God for Yinka and his 3,011 colleagues, lamented that 52 corps members found wanting during the service year in the discharge of their duties would face sanctions. She said, “They will have their service year extended by period ranging from two weeks to five months while others whose cases have hit the ‘abscondment’ mark have been forwarded to our National Director Headquarters Abuja for ratification towards repeat of the service year to serve as a deterrent to other serving corps members.” Copyright PUNCH.
