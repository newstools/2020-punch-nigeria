Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Osun State House of Assembly on Tuesday passed a bill prohibiting kidnapping, banditry and ritual killings in the state. The bill was passed after it was read for the third time, while the Committee of the Whole made some corrections to certain provisions of the bill. Speaking after the passage of the bill, the Speaker, Timothy Owoeye, said the document would soon be sent to the governor for his assent. According to him, the 10-year penalty for kidnapping in the old bill had been replaced with death sentence in the new anti-kidnapping bill. He further explained that in the event that life of the person abducted, restrained or seized was lost in the process, the kidnapper(s) would be liable on conviction to be sentenced to death. Owoeye also said, “Any person who kidnaps another person by any means or instilling fear or tricks or compel another to do anything against his will commits an offence. “Where the life of the person kidnapped is lost in the process and the kidnapper is liable on conviction, he or she is to be sentenced to death. “Not lost in the process, but he is released upon payment of a ransom or performance of a ransom act, the kidnapper is liable on conviction to repay the sum he/she received as ransom and to imprisonment for life and the ransom act shall be reversed.” Copyright PUNCH.
