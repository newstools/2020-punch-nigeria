’Tana Aiyejina Former Ogun State Commissioner of Youth and Sports, Bukola Olopade, says the result of his test for coronavirus has not been released, amidst reports that he tested positive for the deadly virus. In a video posted online, Olopade said he had been in self-isolation since he realised he had symptoms of  COVID-19. “I got tested for COVID-19, I’ve been in self-isolation for five days now. I’ve developed one or two of the symptoms (but) I’m feeling better, I’m feeling stronger, hoping for a very good result in 72 hours. I hope it’s negative,” he stated. Speaking further, the former Ogun State commissioner added, “This video has become essential to let people know that this is real, that’s its happening and should not underestimate what’s going on out there. They must listen to government and all the publications we’ve been getting about being hygienic, using hand sanitisers and staying at home in terms of social distancing. It’s for real. “I want to thank the Lagos State Government for their rapid response and manner with which I was attended to. May God help us.” Copyright PUNCH.
