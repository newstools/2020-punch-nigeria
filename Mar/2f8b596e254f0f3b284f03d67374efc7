Tony Okafor, Awka The Inter-Party Advisory Council, coalition political parties, in Anambra State has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to suspend local government allocations to Anambra State pending when Governor Willie Obiano will conduct council elections. Briefing the journalists in Awka, on Tuesday, the IPAC Media Director in the state, Mr Peter Okala,  described non-conduct of council polls in the staPte as undemocratic and illegal. Okala said President Buhari should intervene by first stopping the Anambra State Local Government allocations until democratically elected governments were put in place in the 21 council areas of the state. He added, “These years of locust has accounted for redundancy in the 21 local government workforce hence the Anambra State Government has taken over the duties of workers and given it to their cronies to ensure that those funds from the internally generated revenue were coming directly to the state government.” The state Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr C-Don Adinuba, said IPAC members were acting in “crass ignorance.” He said the issue of conduct of council poll in the state was pending at the Supreme Court, stating that it would amount to contempt of court for the state to conduct local government polls.
