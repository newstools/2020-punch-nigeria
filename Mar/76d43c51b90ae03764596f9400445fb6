Sola Shittu, Benin An Evbuoriaria Chief Magistrate court in Benin, the Edo State capital, on Monday ordered the remand in prison of 43-year-old Esther Ehikhioya for assaulting a two-year-old girl. She was accused of defiling the girl by putting her finger in her vagina. Ehikhioya, a nanny with the Catholic Intercessory Academy, Sapele Road, Benin, allegedly committed the offence on February 3, 2020. The prosecutor, Mr Peter Ogbe, in the charge sheet number MEV/61c/c/202, said Ehikhioya after putting her finger into the little girl’s vagina, broke her hymen which was against the law.
