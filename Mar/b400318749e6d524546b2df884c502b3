Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A 24-year-old man, Idris Oyawale, on Friday appeared before an Osun State Magistratesâ€™ Court sitting in Ile-Ife for housebreaking and theft. The defendant allegedly stole a Samsung phone valued at N250,000 from the house of one Lola Adewale. The defendant, who was arraigned on three counts of conspiracy, housebreaking and theft, was remanded in the Nigerian Correctional Centre, Ile-Ife, as the court refused to grant his oral application for bail. The police prosecutor, Sunday Osanyintuyi, said the defendant committed the offences on January 7, 2020, at the Oranfe area of Ile-Ife. He said Oyawale conspired with others at large to commit the offences. Osanyintuyi added that the offences contravened sections 383, 390(9), 412 and 516 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun State, 2002. Oyawale pleaded not guilty to the charges pressed against him. His counsel, Martins Awe, applied for his bail and gave an assurance that the suspect would provide reliable sureties. In his ruling, Magistrate Joseph Owolawi ordered that the defendant be remanded in the correctional centre. He adjourned the matter till March 13 for ruling on the bail application. Copyright PUNCH.
