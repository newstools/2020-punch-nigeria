Sola Shittu, Benin A middle-aged mentally-ill man caused a steer on the Oba Ovonramwen Square Ring Road in Benin, Edo State, on Monday, when he stabbed a 23-year-old woman, who was walking in the city centre. The incident caused pandemonium as some youths quickly rushed to the scene and overpowered the man before he could cause more damage. An eyewitness, identified simply as Adora, said the victim was just walking in the crowd when the man suddenly brought out a knife and stabbed her. “We were walking together and the woman was probably rushing to work and was not aware of the man’s presence until he had stabbed her,” Adora stated. She said immediately the victim was stabbed, she fell to the ground and was covered in her own blood. “She was quickly rushed to the Central Hospital for treatment,” Adora added.
