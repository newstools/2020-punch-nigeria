Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri The Borno State Government on Monday locked down all internally displaced persons camps in the state to check against the spread of coronavirus in the state. It imposed a four-week ban on visitors to all IDP camps in the state as one of the stateâ€™s strategies to contain the outbreak of the virus in the state. Governor Babagana Zulum had last week appointed his deputy, Umar Kadafur, to chair a high powered multi-stakeholder response team for coronavirus. The lockdown on IDP camps was announced by Chairperson of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency, Hajiya Yabawa Kolo. Kolo announced the ban during a meeting with 51 camp managers on Monday in Maiduguri. She said the measure became necessary as some of the neighbouring countries like Chad Republic and Cameroon had recorded suspected cases. She lamented that despite closure of the borders by the neighbouring countries, there was still an influx of IDPs into the state. The Borno SEMA Boss directed all camp managers from Gamboru-Ngala, Damasak, Kalabalge, Banki, Bama and Monguno not to accept IDPs from any neighbouring country into their camps. Copyright PUNCH.
