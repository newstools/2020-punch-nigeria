Kayode Oyero The Redeemed Christian Church of God has changed its mode of services in its parishes in Lagos and Ogun States. This was as the two states banned gatherings of more than 50 persons as part of precautionary measures against the ravaging coronavirus with eight cases recorded in Nigeria already. The church’s Assistant General Overseer, Pastor J.F. Odesola, in a statement on Wednesday evening, entitled ‘Slight Alteration in the mode of Service for Parishes in Lagos. Ogun State’ said the mission authority of the church instructed as follows; “Parishes that have an average attendance of 50 members or less can hold their services without any alteration or changes “Parishes that have an average attendance above 50 members are directed to make use of their House Fellowship Centres to run simultaneous services with the main Church. “Parishes that have the facility to run more than one service can also do so, under the strict directive that worshippers won’t exceed 50 people per service. “One supervising minister and an usher could be seconded to each centre for collation of necessary reports (attendance, new converts, newcomers, etc) “All centres are requested to connect to Dove Television to join the live broadcast from the General Overseer during the period “Kindly be informed that this arrangement shall be in operation for the next few weeks based on the position of the government.” The Pentecostal megachurch with its global headquarters in Nigeria under the leadership of Pastor Enoch Adeboye enjoined members not to panic in the face of the ongoing crisis while assuring all of divine intervention.
