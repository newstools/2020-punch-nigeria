Olufemi Atoyebi, Abuja A tuberculosis eradication campaign organisation, Stop TB Partnership Nigeria, has said the last survey conducted on TB showed that as of the close of 2019, Nigeria needed around N85.34bn to control the disease after an estimated 429,000 new cases were recorded during the year. This was disclosed in Abuja on Tuesday at the 2020 Pre-World TB Day event organised by the Ministry of Health’s National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme and the STPN. According to the Executive Secretary of the TB campaign organisation, Joel Mayowa, out of the amount needed to control the disease, only 40 per cent was realised, with 32 per cent of the amount coming from donors. He added that Nigeria was among the 30 high burden countries for tuberculosis.  The country is ranked number one in Africa and 6th in the world among countries with high burden. He said, “Despite significant progress over the last decades, TB remains the world’s deadliest infectious killer. Each day, nearly 3,975 people lose their lives to TB and close to 27,397 people fall ill with this preventable and curable disease. “Out of the N85.34bn ($278m) needed for TB control in Nigeria in the year 2019, only 40 per cent was available to all the implementers of TB control activities in Nigeria. Eight per cent was sourced domestically and 32 per cent from donor funds, with 60 per cent funding gap. “Global efforts to combat TB have saved an estimated 58 million lives since the year 2000 and reduced the TB mortality rate by 42 per cent. The emergence of drug-resistant TB poses a major health threat and could put at risk the gains made in efforts to end TB. “TB is an airborne disease and is curable. It is number one infectious killer disease in the world and among the top 10 causes of death worldwide. “Out of 429,000 estimated new TB cases in Nigeria in 2019, only 120,266 were notified to the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme, with 28 per cent treatment coverage. Of an estimated 21,000 cases recorded in 2018, only 2,384 were diagnosed and 83 per cent of them enrolled on second line treatment.” He added that tuberculosis could be spread easily where there were many people staying in a closed space without enough fresh air.
