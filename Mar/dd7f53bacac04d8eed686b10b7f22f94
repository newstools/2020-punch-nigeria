The European Union (EU) and Government of Nigeria (GoN) have launched a new £2.5M project that will improve livestock disease surveillance and control in Nigeria. Launched on March 4, 2020 in Abuja, the three-year Livestock Disease Surveillance Knowledge Integration (LIDISKI) project aims to boost the livelihoods of smallholder livestock and poultry farmers in Plateau state – the pilot zone, and subsequently 8 other northern states. The LIDISKI project will scale-up surveillance and control of diseases which affect livestock in Nigeria, in particular, Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) and Newcastle Disease (ND). It will also improve the availability of thermotolerant vaccines and bring these vaccines closer to smallholder farmers. LIDISKI’s strategy focuses on four inter-dependent actions – capacity building, engagement of field actors, understanding the epidemiological contexts of PPR and ND in Nigeria, and developing tools and guidelines to design ND and PPR surveillance and control policies in Nigeria. LIDISKI will leverage existing human resource structures and strengthen the capacity of field actors to achieve its goals, particularly the Community Animal Health Worker (CAHW) structure. LIDISKI will increase the capacity of NVRI to produce and deliver efficient vaccines against PPR and ND thereby reducing the incidence of these diseases. LIDISKI will in addition reach the rural herders and farmers and equip them with adequate information on disease recognition, animal sampling, and vaccination good practices. EU Delegation Representative, Kurt Cornelis said at the event “The EU is providing the sum of €2.5 million in grants to Nigeria to develop relevant capacities required to address the challenges of animals – in particular- livestock disease.” He highlighted the importance of this project for food security, human health, and prevention of the disease spread to neighboring countries. <img class="alignnone wp-image-779398 size-full" src="https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/18194516/GoN1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="366" srcset="https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/18194516/GoN1.jpg 600w, https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/18194516/GoN1-300x183.jpg 300w, https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/18194516/GoN1-30x18.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> Representing the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development – Alhaji Sabo Nanono, Dr. Peter Umana commended the EU’s support to the project and assured the agency that the ministry has adopted the national strategy for the control and eradication of small ruminants disease with the support of the World Organization for Animal Health and FAO under the direction of the United Nations. He affirmed the preparedness of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture through the department of Disease Control Services to fully support LIDISKI to ensure its successful implementation. LIDISKI is implemented by a consortium of partners led by the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD) and with the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI), Istituto Zooprofilattico Spermentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), and IKORE. The NVRI is a Veterinary Institute committed to research excellence and the production of standard quality vaccines for the livestock industry. The IZSV is an Italian public veterinary Institute which conducts prevention, control and research activities in three main areas: animal health and welfare, food safety, environmental protection. IKORE is a development organization based in Nigeria whose vision is to contribute to a prosperous world that creates an opportunity for a better life for all especially the poor and vulnerable.
