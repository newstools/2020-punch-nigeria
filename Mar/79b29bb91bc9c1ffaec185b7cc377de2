Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Some measures adopted in mitigating climate change were actually worsening water scarcity in Nigeria and other countries, the Nigerian Meteorological Agency said on Sunday. According to NiMet, climate change mitigating measures such as the use of biofuels, which are fuels derived directly from living matter, exacerbate the scarcity of water. The Director-General, NiMet, Prof. Sani Mashi, said this in his address to commemorate the World Meteorological Day which holds today (Monday). He said, “Some climate change mitigation measures such as the expanded use of biofuels are exacerbating water scarcity. Therefore, climate and water data underpin the management of surface-water supplies and disaster risk reduction. “These include calculations of the frequency and duration of heavy rainfall, the probable maximum precipitation and flood forecasting.” Mashi observed that one major impact of climate change was water, either making it too little or sometimes too much for human survival and comfort. This, he said, posed serious threat to sustainable development and security. ”Copyright PUNCH.
