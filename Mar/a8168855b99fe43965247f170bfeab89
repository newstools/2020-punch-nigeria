Samson Folarin The Academic Staff Union of Universities has passed a vote of no confidence in the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council, Dr Wale Babalakin. The ASUU Chairman, Dr Dele Ashiru, said the decision was taken at a congress of the union. “Dr Wale Babalakin is now a persona non grata on our campus. We don’t want to see him again anywhere in the university. He is no longer needed,” he added.

The varsity management, led by Prof Toyin Ogundipe, had been embroiled in a fight with the governing council, led by Babalakin. The fight came to a climax with the suspension of the convocation ceremonies earlier scheduled for this Monday. The council had, however, blamed that development on the VC, who was accused of sidelining the council in the convocation plans.
