Seun Adesoye A suspected ritualist, Dona Asogbo, has been arrested by the personnel of the Lagos State Police Command. PUNCH Metro gathered that the suspect was arrested when the personnel stormed a ritualists’ den at Oko-Afo in the Badagry area of the state, while acting on a tip-off by a resident of the community, Yusuf Rashid.
