Onyekachukwu Meluwa, Warri A 13-year-old boy, identified as Progress Life, has reportedly stabbed his friend, Marvellous Ekrake, to death over financial disagreement in Ughelli, Delta State. The incident occurred on Saturday at the police quarters located behind the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission, opposite the Ughelli Police Station. It was gathered that the victim bled to death from the stab wound. Our correspondent learnt that the 15-year-old Marvellous collapsed at the balcony of a neighbour, where he struggled to for help. Sources said a disagreement ensued between the teenagers over how to share money for a job they both executed on a building earlier in the day. One of the sources said, “The suspect was said to have approached the deceased to demand a certain amount of the money. But his demand was rebuffed by the victim. “Angered by the refusal of the victim, whose parents were not at home at the time of the incident, the suspect allegedly grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Marvellous in the throat after which he fled the scene. “Before he died, Marvellous crawled to the house of a police inspector crying for help, but he died before he could get the needed help as a result of losing so much blood.
