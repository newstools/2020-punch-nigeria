Tony Okafor, Awka The Primate of Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, Most Rev. Nicholas Okoh, has raised the alarm that some Anglican priests are bowing to gay pressure. He said the church would not hesitate to show such priests the way out of the church if found. Okoh spoke during the dedication of ‘Lady Alice Chiebonam Ozumba Ultra-modern Maternity Complex,’ Iyienu Mission Hospital, in Ogidi, Anambra State. He regretted what he called “the subtle compromisers by some priests in the church, warning them to retrace their steps or risk being exposed. He added, “People are lobbying us to abandon our faith and theology to embrace their false teaching. Unfortunately, some of our priests are already bowing to the pressure.

If they do, it will be difficult to rescue. “If we all become homosexuals; who will give birth to who? If it’s now man to man, there won’t be any Inyienu maternity. God who created this world did it the excellent way, let no man tamper with it.” Copyright PUNCH.
