Delegates from oil-producing countries started arriving Wednesday in Vienna to discuss output cuts in a meeting overshadowed by worries over the new coronavirus. Two medical staff members, wearing Red Cross vests, were taking the temperature of ministers and other delegates entering the Vienna headquarters of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.  OPEC itself tweeted a video of Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo greeting Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak by trying to touch their feet together in a “footshake” – respecting coronavirus guidelines to avoid close body contact as much as possible. The OPEC extraordinary two-day meeting takes place Thursday and Friday in the capital of Austria, which itself has recorded almost 30 cases of the new coronavirus nationwide. At their last meeting in December, the producers agreed to cut production by 500,000 barrels per day, with Saudi Arabia offering a further 400,000 barrels of “voluntary” cuts. Upon his arrival, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, whose country has been strongly hit by the virus – urged OPEC and its allies to cut at least around half a million barrels. “After the coronavirus situation we have an oversupply in the market, it’s necessary OPEC and non-OPEC do something for the balance in the market,” he told reporters. OPEC’s joint technical committee last month recommended a cut of 600,000 barrels to ward off the effects of the coronavirus slowdown. AFP
