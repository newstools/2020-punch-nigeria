Friday Olokor The Independent National Electoral Commission has told those scheduled to vote  in the  March 14 by-elections in Sokoto, Kwara, Jigawa and Niger states  to  file lawsuits against  the candidates they believe have  submitted forged  certificates. The body gave  the advice  following the publication of the affidavits containing the personal particulars of the candidates  for  the  by-elections. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman,  Festus Okoye, said these in a statement on Saturday. He said, “In line with the provisions of Section 31(3) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), the commission has published the affidavits containing the personal particulars (Form EC9E, formerly Form CF001) of and documents submitted by all candidates nominated by parties to participate in the elections. “The commission has, in addition, uploaded the said Form EC9E (CF001) and the attached documents on its website. The commission wishes to draw attention to the provision of Section 31 (5) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) which entitles ‘any person who has reasonable grounds to believe that any information given by a candidate in the affidavit or any document submitted by that candidate is false to file a suit at the Federal High Court, High Court of a State or FCT against such a person seeking a declaration that the information contained in the affidavit is false’. “The commission is determined to conduct free and fair elections in accordance with extant laws while working with critical stakeholders to ensure a peaceful conduct of the exercise.” Copyright PUNCH.
