Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Bayelsa State Environmental Sanitation Authority, on Saturday, apprehended 42 persons for allegedly violating the sanitation law. The defaulters, made up of 30 males and 12 females, were arrested during the period meant for the cleaning of their surroundings as directed by the government. The Chairman of the BSESA, Christopher Ewhrudjakpo, said some of the defaulters were apprehended for unauthorised movement, loitering and playing football, among others, while the sanitation was ongoing. “They will be arraigned before a magistrates’ court,” he said. Ewhrudjakpo commended the large turnout of residents, who participated in the clean-up across the state. He, however, frowned on the attitude of military personnel, who disobeyed the law and moved about during the sanitation. Ewhrudjakpo added, “We met some military men and accosted them and told them that it was important for them to obey the laws of the land. If they continue to disobey the laws, what will the civilians do? “We urged them to obey the law whenever the exercise is taking place. They should comply so that other citizens will do the same.” Copyright PUNCH.
