Kayode Oyero The Senior Pastor of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, Biodun Fatoyinbo, invites members of his church for a physical worship service on Sunday, Mar 22,  despite the need for social distancing as coronavirus cases increased to 26 in Nigeria. The PUNCH reports that Abuja, where the headquarters of COZA is located, recorded three cases of the deadly virus on Saturday. Several state governments have banned social gatherings of more than 50 persons to prevent community transmission of the novel virus. Top clergymen including Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God; Pastor W.F. Kumuyi of the Deeper Christian Life Ministry; Pastor Sam Adeyemi of Daystar Christian Centre, amongst others told their members to stay at home and join their online services. But Fatoyinbo, through a post on his verified Instagram page, invited his members to a physical Sunday service in Abuja. He wrote, “Hello family, we are geared up to excitedly receive you tomorrow, 22nd of March by 07:30 am at our #CentrePointCampus, Evelyn Events Centre, Gwarinpa. “Worshippers can be assured of our unwavering commitment to a clean and conducive environment for service. “Your safety is paramount to us and we are complying with the directives of the FCT administration by ensuring: “Temperatures are measured using electronic thermometers; availability of alcohol-based sanitisers; a considerable space between worshippers; effective air flow system; and above all, the blood of Jesus severes us from pestilence. “See you there and remember #GoodDaysAhead! #BiodunFatoyinbo #Pb #COZAGlobal #March #2020 #COZACentrePoint #COZAGwarinpa #CovenantofProtection #Exploits.”
