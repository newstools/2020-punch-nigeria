Adeniyi Olugbemi, Sokoto Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, has assured stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party that his administration will adhere strictly to the stipulation of the party on gender affirmation. Tambuwal stated this at a meeting of the party stakeholders in preparation for the ward congress scheduled to hold today (Tuesday). He said, “We are going to respect the position of the party that 30 per cent of positions to be filled during the congresses should be allotted to women. “As a result, we must encourage women to participate in this process that would give us new leaders and also allow them to provide the leadership needed irrespective of their gender.” Tambuwal also expressed confidence that the ward congress of the party in the state would be rancour-free. The leader of the delegation of the party’s congress committee to the state, Ogbuefi Ozomgbachi, had noted that the people of the state were known to be peace-loving, “So, we do not expect the congress to be marred by irregularities or violence,” he said.
