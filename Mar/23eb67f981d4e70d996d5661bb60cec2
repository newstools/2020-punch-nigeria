Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Wednesday said leadership at all levels required a lot of sacrifices and commitments. Lawan stated this when the Yobe State Students’ Association, Ahmadu Bello University chapter, paid him a courtesy visit in Abuja. The students were on an excursion to the National Assembly to observe the Senate in plenary with a view to learning more about parliamentary proceedings. Lawan, who also hails from Yobe State, in a statement by his media office, was quoted as saying, “Leadership at every level requires a lot of sacrifice, a lot of commitment and even when some of our people will say political office is a thing you can just handle anyhow, that is not correct. “When people elect you, they give you responsibility and what you do with that office is between you and your God, and of course, you are responsible to them as well as to God. “No matter how small an office is, it is important we continue to do our best to discharge our responsibility.” The Senate President said Yobe State and the North-East geopolitical zone in general was ranked the poorest in the country by the United Nations Development Programme for a longtime. He added, “We want to see an improvement in the lives of our people; that is why we are in politics.” Copyright PUNCH.
