Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Nigeria Road Safety Strategy 2019-2023,  is targeting a reduction in road traffic fatalities by 35 per cent by year 2023. The NRSS is also seeking allocation of 20 per cent of Road Safety Intervention Fund to Non-Motorized Transport Initiatives and the establishment of the State Road Safety Advisory Council at the state level to address road crashes. Currently, injuries and deaths resulting from road traffic crashes are Nigeria’s third leading cause of overall deaths. Speaking at a workshop on the NRSS II in Abuja on Thursday, the Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, explained that the strategy documents, which is an updated version of the 2014-2018 edition, would help in further reducing road accidents and fatalities in the country. The SGF, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary in his office, Mr Olusegun Adekunle, said the country capacity review which identified pertinent gaps in the nation’s road safety strategy necessitated a paradigm shift in the national approach to road safety issues.
