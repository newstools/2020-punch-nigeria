Hindi Livinus, Yola The Adamawa/Taraba Command of the Nigeria Customs Service has traced bags of foreign rice hidden in a private residence in Yola, the Adamawa State capital. Customs personnel raided the residence on Monday following a tip-off and evacuated several 50Kg bags of foreign parboiled rice. Our correspondent learnt that the NCS had been seizing foreign rice from markets in pursuit of its campaign against contraband goods. Addressing newsmen in Yola after the raid, the NCS spokesman, Mu’awuya Abubakar, said the command got wind of the illegal activities of smugglers at the property. He attributed the development to the cooperation of the stakeholders in support of its war against smuggling of contraband items into the country. “We got to know that some individuals now at large were smuggling foreign rice and hiding them here,” he stated. Abubakar said the seizure was in furtherance of the determination of the NCS to ensure that smuggled rice was not sold to consumers. Abubakar cautioned landlords to be wary of what their tenants use their properties for “as landlords will be liable when their properties are found to have been used for illicit activities.” He added that the house in Doubeli, from where the foreign rice was impounded, would be sealed until investigation was concluded. He stated that no arrest was made because the suspects had fled before the arrival of the NCS personnel. Copyright PUNCH.
