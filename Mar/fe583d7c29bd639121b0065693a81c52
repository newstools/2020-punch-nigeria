Nike Popoola The Chairperson, Association of Professional Women Bankers, Mrs Tinuke Leye-Isola, has described the campaign for gender equality as achievable. She stated this at a one-day capacity development programme for female bankers in Lagos to mark the International Women’s Day. In a statement, she noted that most of the speakers centered on personal branding for the participants and how they could take ownership of their career and advance it. “They are also taught what is needed to get to the top and also etiquette they need to apply from day-to-day running of your career,” she added. Leye-Isola said, “This is a capacity development programme and not a workshop in commemoration of International Women’s Day. The day brings to bare women’s achievement and contribution not only to national development but also economic development and building society as well. “The day also pushes for gender equality in our workplace. That is why APWB also lends its voice in the celebration of the International Women’s Day. “Although gender equality is still a long way to go, but it is achievable. That is what IWD is advocating, that given the same equal opportunity without being biased, we can create an enabled world by giving women a chance.” Copyright PUNCH.
