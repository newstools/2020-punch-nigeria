The Louvre museum in Paris kept its doors closed to visitors Sunday as staff withheld labour citing fears over the coronavirus, a union representative told AFP. Some 300 staff of the world’s most visited museum met in the morning and voted “almost unanimously” not to open in the morning, Christian Galani of the CGT labour union told AFP. “The meeting was arranged to discuss the concerns of staff,” he said, adding management representatives were unable to convince workers to go to work. France has recorded 100 coronavirus cases, and two deaths, since the end of January. On Saturday, the government announced several measures to try and curb the outbreak, including cancelling all gatherings of more than 5,000 people in confined spaces.

The Louvre received 9.6 million visitors in 2019. (AFP)
