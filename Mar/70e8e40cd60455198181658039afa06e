Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri The lockdown of the country as a means to combat the spread of coronavirus may result in the loss of over N3tn investments in poultry, the Poultry Association of Nigeria has said. Addressing a press conference on Friday in Maiduguri, the National President, Poultry Association of Nigeria, Mr Ezekiel Ibrahim, said the Federal Government needed to tread carefully in considering the lockdown of the country in response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said, “The situation of the poultry products market is not stable at the moment, and if urgent steps are not taken to remove the restriction on the movement of vehicles conveying poultry products like day-old chicks, meat and eggs, feeds and drugs, which are daily needed by all Nigerians. “The poultry industry, which is on the part of becoming the mainstay of the Nigerian livestock industry, might be completely destroyed.” Estimating the investments in the poultry industry as N3tn, Ibrahim said it was important to relax the restriction on the movement of all vehicles carrying poultry products and other fast-moving consumer goods products. “While the above is considered as very urgent and important for the continued supply of protein to Nigerians, we implore the government to consider granting some palliatives to egg and day-old chicken producers who are unable to sell their chickens, eggs and feed as a result restriction on inter-state movement,” he said.
