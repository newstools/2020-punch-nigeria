Adelani Adepegba, Abuja Participants at a media dialogue have urged the media and religious leaders to shun fake news and misinformation. They also cautioned clerics against instigating crisis and stoking hatred with their sermons and utterances which were often reported by the media. This was contained in a communique issued at the end of the media dialogue with religious leaders with the theme, ‘Advancing Peace and Interreligious Dialogue in the Age of Social Media,’ organised by the African Centre for Media and Information Literacy in partnership with the National Orientation Agency, in Abuja on Monday. The statement noted that media and religious platforms should be used in promoting peace, unity and social cohesion. The communique signed by AFRICMIL Coordinator, Chido Onumah, also urged religious leaders to refrain from being used by politicians, adding that religion should be separated from politics. It called for the enlightenment of the people at the grass-roots level, noting that they were more prone to misinformation and false messages from religious leaders and the social media. The communique read in part, “Shun stereotyping; identify crimes for what they are. Your brain is hardwired to make quick calls, and that’s okay. The problem comes when we start to apply those stereotypes beyond that immediate impulse; that’s called bias, which is basically a belief that a stereotype is true. For example, the stereotype that religion is bad can lead to the suggestion that about innate differences between religions.” The Assistant Director, Media, NOA, Paul Odenyi, blamed the elite for the division in the country, saying they had failed to bridge the social gaps and promote peace.
