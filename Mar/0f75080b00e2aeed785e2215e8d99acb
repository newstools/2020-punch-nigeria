Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo An Osun State Magistratesâ€™ Court sitting in Osogbo, on Tuesday, remanded one Dele Abiodun, who stood as surety for his younger brother, Femi, who is being tried for manslaughter. The 43-year-old Dele was remanded by Magistrate Olugbenga Oladoke after his brother, whom he stood surety for on October 10, 2017, before an Osun State High Court, Osogbo, jumped bail. The police prosecutor, Idoko John, said Dele had given an assurance that he would produce the accused in court until the trial was concluded. Dele pleaded not guilty to the one count levelled against him, and his counsel, Remigus Ngwu, urged the court to admit his client to bail. But Idoko opposed the bail application, saying Dele was not resident within the magisterial district of the court. Oladoke ordered that the accused be remanded in the Ilesa Correctional Centre and adjourned the matter till March 31, 2020, for ruling on the bail application. Copyright PUNCH.
