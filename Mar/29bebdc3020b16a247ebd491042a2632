Salami was found him guilty of two counts of conspiracy and robbery. The prosecutor, Jide Martins, had told the court during the trial that Salami, who was arrested on April 16, 2016, stole two phones and two wristwatches belonging to one Okocha Afiam. According to Martins, the offences are contrary to Section 299 (a) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State. He said Salami committed the crime alongside his gang members, who escaped arrest.
