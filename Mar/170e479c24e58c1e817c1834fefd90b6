Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has expressed optimism that the Peoples Democratic Party will win the suspended Bayelsa Central and West senatorial bye-elections whenever they are conducted. Governor Diri stated this on Monday night while addressing the PDP faithful shortly after the conduct of the party’s state congress at the Chief Diepreye Alamieyeseigha Memorial Banquet Hall in Yenagoa. His acting Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, quoted the governor as saying that the peaceful conduct of the PDP ward, local government and state congresses demonstrated the party’s maturity and dominance in the state. He said the successful congresses had helped reposition the party to continually enjoy the support of the people and win elections in the state. He expressed gratitude to former President Goodluck Jonathan and his predecessor, Seriake Dickson, for their contributions to the success of the congresses. The governor also commended the elders, delegates and members of the party and paid special tributes to the outgoing Chairman, Mr Moses Cleopas, and his team for their commitment to the overriding interest of the party. While congratulating the newly elected executive, Diri urged them to emulate the worthy examples set by the Cleopas-led executive and improve on the fortune of the party in the next four years. He also called on stakeholders to support the new executive to enable them to serve the party effectively. He said, “We can only make them to succeed when we give them our full support like we did to the outgoing chairman and other members of that executive. “They were committed, united and faithful to our party. So, I believe you will follow the example and footsteps that they have laid for you. “Let me also seize this opportunity to express our gratitude and appreciation to the former President of Nigeria, Dr Goodluck Jonathan, and my boss and leader, former Governor Henry Seriake Dickson, for their support for this congress.”
