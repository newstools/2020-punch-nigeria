Tukur Muntari, Kano The Kano State Government has warned proprietors of private schools  that they will be sanctioned  for not  complying  with the directive to  close  their  schools  following  coronavirus spread in the country. The Commissioner for Education, Alhaji Mohammad  Kiru,  gave  the warning  at a press conference  in Kano on Wednesday. He said  the  reports reaching the ministry had indicated that some private school proprietors had shunned the instructions. Kiru  said  the ministry had  set up  a task force  that would go round to ascertain the level of compliance. He  said any school  proprietors found violating the instructions  would be prosecuted and their operating licences withdrawn to serve as a deterrent to others. The commissioner  said  the ministry, in collaboration with the Office of the Secretary to the State Government, would hold a meeting with teachers of Tsangaya schools to address the Almajiri  issues. He said any Almajiri found roaming the streets would be arrested and sent  to their  states. Copyright PUNCH.
