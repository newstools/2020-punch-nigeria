The Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, on Friday, met with the dethroned Emir of Kano, Lamido Sanusi, in Awe, Nasarawa State. El-Rufai earlier stated in a Facebook post, on Friday, accompanied by a picture in his car that he would be meeting Sanusi. The governor has been a friend of the emir for decades. He appointed Sanusi as the Pro-chancellor of the Kaduna State University and also made him the Vice-Chairman of the stateâ€™s investment board after Sanusi was dethroned. The governor was among those who went to receive Sanusi in 2014 when the latter was suspended as the Central Bank Governor by former President Goodluck Jonathan. Meanwhile, the Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the release of Sanusi, who was banished to Awe, a town in Nasarawa State.
