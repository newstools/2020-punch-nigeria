Nike Popoola United Bank for Africa says it empowered 400 entrepreneurs with capacity training as part of efforts to help them succeed in their business. A statement said the bank disclosed this during its Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises capacity training where about 400 entrepreneurs attended in Onitsha, Anambra State. The beneficiaries were trained in record keeping, cost reduction, stock compiling, financial and taxation planning, maximising opportunities, financial planning and projections. UBA’s Regional Head of Anambra II, Ozioma Anyanuno , who flagged off the MSME training, said the capacity development workshop was intended to add value to customers’ businesses through improving their knowledge and skills. “It was also conceptualised to fill the existing gaps observed in business and allay beneficiaries’  fears of expanding their businesses,” he said. He said, “Modern day business requires that an average businessman regularly updates his knowledge to cope with the changing economy. “Besides, this is an Internet/ technology driven age and our customers need to learn new ways of doing business and how to package their businesses for increased patronage.” Anyanuno said the turnout was a demonstration of the bank’s acceptance by the traders and the importance they attached to the workshop. He promised a repeat of the exercise to accommodate more people. Head of E-banking, Babatunde Ajayi said the programme was part of the bank’s corporate social responsibility in furtherance of its responsiveness to customers’ needs. Ajayi assured that the bank was committed to the overall growth and success of its customers. Copyright PUNCH.
