Sola Shittu, Benin Factions in the lingering political feud in the All Progressives Congress APC, Edo State on Wednesday throw their weight behind the reconciliatory move in the party. The Special Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie, who spoke on the issue, said the peace move was the initiative of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). He said, “All party members and party leaders are supposed to abide by this peace initiative. There are various demands that the President has insisted must be upheld.  Two governorship elections are coming up and Edo is part of it. The removal of all factions is also one of the conditions; so we are very much in tune with the peace move by Mr President. We are hundred per cent in support of it as directed by the President, although there are still some elements in Edo politics who are still making noise”, he said. Similarly, the APC factional Chairman, Mr Anslem Ojezua described the move as a welcome development. He said, “I think it’s a welcome development but he has to let it come down. Let him bring it down to the base. There are lots of states including Edo State that require his attention. “If the reconciliation effort is not rooted at the base, it will lose its meaning. It is an unfolding drama and I don’t want to say anything more than that,” he said In his own reaction, a former attorney general and commissioner for justice, Henry Idahagbon, said that was the way a leader should behave. He said, “Of course, it is a good thing. That is the way a leader should behave. A leader that is capable of fighting must also be capable of settling.” Copyright PUNCH.
