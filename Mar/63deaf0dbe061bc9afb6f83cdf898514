Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Governor of Bayelsa State, Mr Douye Diri, on Monday officially inaugurated the new Secretary to the State Government, Mr Konbowei Benson. Diri advised the appointee to consider his appointment as a call to higher service for the benefit of the people of the state. He enjoined the new SSG who was sworn in at a ceremony held at the Government House, Yenagoa, to liaise with the Head of Service and permanent secretaries to ensure effective implementation of government’s policies and programmes. Diri expressed confidence in the ability of Benson, who was a three-term speaker of the state House of Assembly, to discharge his responsibilities in his new post given his pedigree. The governor said, “Clearly, he is a square peg in a square hole. We believe that he will perform his duties creditably as SSG. “He has the duty of ensuring that the policies and programmes of this administration are implemented to the letter.” In another development, Diri set up a committee to look into all pending issues of salary and promotion arrears as well as minimum wage issues among others. The state Head of Service, Mrs Biobelemoye Charles-Onyema, disclosed this in an interview with journalists after a meeting between the organised labour and the state government. She said the committee was expected to submit its report to the governor within two weeks, adding that teachers, especially those in the primary school system, would henceforth be given greater attention.
