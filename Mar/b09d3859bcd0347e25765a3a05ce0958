Peter Dada, Akure The Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission has decried the lackadaisical way the constituency projects are being handled in Nigeria, saying both the constituents and the lawmakers were always not serious with the projects. The ICPC Chairman, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, stated this at a town hall meeting in Akure, the Ondo State capital, on Tuesday. The programme was organised by the ICPC in collaboration with the National Orientation Agency. Owasanoye, represented by the commissioner in charge of Osun, Ekiti and Ondo states, Mr Baba Shuaib, lamented that a lot of money had been spent on constituency projects in the country by the government but there was nothing to show for it. He said, “ Since the beginning of this democracy ( in 1999), Nigeria has spent over N1tn on constituency projects and there is nothing to show for it. “Constituency projects and other projects are sponsored by the government, they belong to the people. They belong to you as fruits of national resources and government responsibility to the people.” “Your representatives in the legislature, who select constituency projects do so because they are close to you, and it is expected that they understand your needs better. “You should therefore work with them to make sure that projects chosen for you actually reflect your needs. You can follow up on your projects approved for your community by asking for information on them.” Copyright PUNCH.
