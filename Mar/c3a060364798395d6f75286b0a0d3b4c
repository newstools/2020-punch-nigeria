Johnson Okafor Consolidated Hallmark Insurance Plc has said it is determined to achieve a new capital base of N10bn for general insurance business by June 2020. The company’s Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr Eddie Efekoha, said this on Monday at a media briefing on its ongoing rights issue. Efekoha said the company would stick to the initial deadline of June, not the current deadline of December. He said the rights issue would enable the company to meet the new capital requirement. He said, “While CHI has continued to perform well on several parameters, the essence of this capital raising exercise is to enhance the capitalisation of Consolidated Hallmark Insurance Plc in order to meet the revised minimum statutory capital of N10bn stipulated by the National Insurance Commission as being the statutory requirement for the operation of a non-life (general) insurance business. “At our company’s Annual General Meeting, held on November 21, 2019, shareholders had authorised the company, among other matters, to raise additional capital of up to N4.5bnn by way of issuance of shares.” Copyright PUNCH.
