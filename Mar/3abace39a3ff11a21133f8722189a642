Seun Adesoye and Ifeoluwa Oyerinde the Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, has announced that the state government has inaugurated an app for yellow taxis called Ekocab. Oladeinde, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Oluseyi Whenu, spoke on Tuesday at the inauguration of the Ekocab mobile app. He said, “Technology has reduced the world to a small global village and there is the need to move all sectors of our economy, including transportation, to meet the current global technological practices. “As a government, we are developing a transport system that will provide commuters with options of commuting from one end to the other, choosing among different available modes without stress. This is why we have created Ekocab, which is a mobile app for yellow taxis to make transportation easier and more accessible for Lagos State residents.” The Chairman of the Yellow Taxi/Ekocab Association, Michael Oladipupo, said, “It is very easy to know the location and the taxi park that each driver belongs to for security purposes. “Also, we have an edge over other taxi apps because we are very conversant with roads. You can call us from the comfort of your home and our good air-conditioned vehicles will be available to drop you at your destination at a minimal cost.” The Chief Technological Officer, Ekocab, Nathaniel Gideon, said the app could only be accessed through smart phones and operations would begin on March 17.
