Kelvin Ekerete Several players of former Nigeria champions Lobi Stars were left injured on Monday after their team bus was razed down by fire on their way back from a Nigeria Professional Football League game in Ilorin. The Makurdi-based side beat hosts Kwara United 1-0 on Sunday in their match-day 22 fixture at the Ilorin Township Stadium and had almost arrived at their base, when the fire reportedly began along Nakka Road, on the outskirts of Makurdi, the Benue State capital. The cause of the fire was unknown as of the time of filing this report but our correspondent learnt that several players sustained varying degrees of injuries while trying to escape from the burning bus, which had turned to a raging inferno within minutes the fire started. “Some players suffered bruises but thank God none is critical. The entire team is fine,” Lobi assistant coach Lawal Abiodun told our correspondent. In a video circulated on social media, Lobi striker, Musa Najare, was heard frantically explaining the situation. “Look at our car, look at Lobi Stars car, God thank you, thank you Jesus. My name is Musa Najare, look at what is happening to us right now. This is our car, this is Lobi Stars car. Thank you Jesus for saving us,” the center-forward was heard screaming. Copyright PUNCH.
