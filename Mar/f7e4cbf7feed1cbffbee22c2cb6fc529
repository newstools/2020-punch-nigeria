Mudiaga Affe Mansfield Apartment has petitioned the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, over the activities of land grabbers that have encroached on its land in the Surulere area of Lagos State. The real estate agent also said its workers were being molested and chased away from the property with the assistance of the police. Speaking at a press briefing in Lagos on Friday, a director with Mansfield Apartment, Mr Alex Adefarasin, said his organisation had approached the court for redress over the property. He said the petition became necessary to forestall imminent breakdown of law and order in the area. Adefarasin said, “In August 2019, we purchased the property from one Madam Iyalode Efunroye Tinubu family registered trustees, backed by a Supreme Court judgment and power of attorney from the family’s attorney on the parcel of land. We also have in our possession the registered survey of the land. In other words, we are in legal possession of the parcel of land. “Having fulfilled all the legal requirements, we subsequently commenced preliminary work on the project. To our dismay, sometimes in February this year, agents of a company, (names withheld), in conjunction with some policemen, stormed our site, drove our workers away and maliciously destroyed the two structures we have put on the ground.” Copyright PUNCH.
