Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has adjourned plenary for 14 days as coronavirus spreads in Nigeria hitting 40 cases already. The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, made this known in his opening remarks at the plenary on Tuesday. Gbajabiamila said the lawmakers would only work on an economic stimulus bill to protect Nigerians and the economy against the impact of COVID-19. The House had on March 3, 2020, resolved that the National Assembly should suspend plenary for two weeks for fear of coronavirus, asking the management to install screening and sanitation devices at the National Assembly Complex, Abuja. The Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, had raised a point of order on legislative privilege, saying, “I think that this House should suspend plenary for a period of two weeks, for the management to sanitise everybody and allow it to put measures in place so that all of us can be tested. “It may sound like a joking matter but it is a very serious matter. And I think this House should take this as a very serious matter, otherwise, you would not know who to shake (hands with).”
