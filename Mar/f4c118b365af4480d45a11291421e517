Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, on Thursday listed the states that were delaying the formation of a Committee on Constitution Review. Gbajabiamila listed Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Katsina, Kogi, Nasarawa, Niger, Ogun, Osun, Plateau and Taraba as the erring states. The Speaker had last week decried that several state caucuses had yet to nominate members to the committee. He had given them till this week to forward the names of their nominees, failure of which he would be forced to nominate members himself. At the plenary on Thursday, Gbajabiamila decried that some states had still not complied with his directive. He gave the caucuses till Monday to forward their representatives. The committee is to compile all bills seeking to alter the constitution for various amendments, collect memoranda and organise public hearing on them, forward them to the 36 state Houses of Assembly for concurrence and collate state votes on the bills. The Senate had earlier on February 6, 2020, constituted a 56-member committee, including eight principal officers who would serve as steering committee within the larger committee. President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, had appointed a senator from each of the 36 states of the federation and two senators from each of the six geopolitical zones as principal officers. While the Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, is chairman of the committee in the Senate, the Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Wase, is heading that of the House. Copyright PUNCH.
