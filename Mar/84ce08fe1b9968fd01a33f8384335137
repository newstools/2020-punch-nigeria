Sola Shittu, Benin The 14 Edo State lawmakers who were not inaugurated last year on Thursday promised to embrace peace if offered by the state government and they were inaugurated. Spokesman for the lawmakers, Mr Washington Osifo, who spoke with The PUNCH on the telephone on Thursday, said, “If they now allow us to be sworn in and do our job, why not, there is nothing bad in it. We are not asking them to give us another vote, we are only asking them to allow us to reap the benefits of our labour. “We have always sued for peace. We have always argued that having contested   an election and won with certificates of return, it will be unlawful and wicked for anybody to have kept us out and continue to keep us out of the house. It is our right; by the reason of winning the election, to be sworn in and commence our work.” Osifo, a former Commissioner under Adams Oshiomhole as governor of Edo State commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.),  and the governor’s for listening to the leaders of the party. He said the reason why there was a referee in a game was  not because the players were not men of integrity but because as human beings, we are prone to mistakes.” He explained that the National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole “is the custodian of the constitution of the APC and the head of the organisation,” noting that it behooves him to ensure a united home.
