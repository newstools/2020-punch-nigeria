Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Ibadan family heads, otherwise known as the authentic Mogajis, have cautioned Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State against his query to some traditional rulers in Ekiti State. The group also indicated its readiness to pay a solidarity visit to the deposed Emir of Kano, Lamido Sanusi. The Mogajis described the face-off between Fayemi and the Pelupelu Obas as dangerous to Yoruba culture. They said the governor should desist from any act that could erode the value of the traditional institution. In a statement by Chief Wale Oladoja, the group reminded the Ekiti State governor and his Kano State counterpart, Alhaji Abdullahi Ganduje, that their tenures were just for a while, hence, should not distort the traditional settings. It partly read, “We are surprised to read that the governor of Ekiti State is also considering attacking traditional institution in his state. Attacking traditional institution is synonymous with abuse of office.

Fayemi should not import politics of bitterness from other tribes to Yorubaland. We respect our monarch and we won’t do anything to hurt them.” On the deposition of the former Emir of Kano, the Mogajis said, “Ganduje is the governor today,  but he should be reminded that he may not be there tomorrow. He should not destroy the traditional institution in Kano State before he leaves office. “When has it become a crime for our traditional leaders to say the truth because of intimidation?” Copyright PUNCH.
