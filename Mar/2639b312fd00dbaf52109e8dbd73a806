Tessy Igomu Contrary to what the National Centre for Disease Control wants Nigerians to believe, Ribavirin, the only drug currently being used in the treatment of Lassa fever, does not suppress viral transmission, viral production, or enhance immune response. Ribavirin only efficiently suppresses the replication of Lassa virus in vitro (in a test tube), and shows only moderate efficacy in reducing presence of viruses in the blood in a living organism. This was the finding of six researchers led by Kirsten Alexandra Eberhardt of the Department of Tropical Medicine, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany, and published in peer-reviewed International Journal of Infectious Diseases. The researchers said, “The quality of evidence for the use of Ribavirin is very low, stemming largely from a single non-randomized clinical trial with historic controls and high risk of bias. “Based on the available data, current treatment guidelines may therefore put patients with mild Lassa fever at increased risk of death.” They warned, “The role of Ribavirin in the treatment of Lassa fever requires urgent reassessment.” Writing about the disease, the scientists said, clinically, Lassa fever is difficult to distinguish from other endemic febrile illnesses in West Africa, noting that its symptoms include fever, pharyngitis, gastrointestinal complaints, and cough.
