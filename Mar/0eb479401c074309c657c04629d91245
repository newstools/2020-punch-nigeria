The statement partly read, “The  chairman said the delay in some judicial processes, such as service of notices, issuance of bankers’ orders, arrest warrants and rulings were holding down the work of the commission.” The statement further quoted the CJN as saying, “The judiciary, especially the Supreme Court is all out to give you a helping hand in trying to see that all traces of corruption are reduced. ‘We are urging you, wherever you think that something is wrong with the judiciary, please draw our attention to it, be it an area court, magistrate and so on, it will be dealt with.” Copyright PUNCH.
