Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt THE All Progressives Congress has said some of its members were conniving with its enemies to destroy the party in Rivers State through judicial manipulations and betrayal. The Publicity Secretary of one of the factions of the APC in Rivers State, Mr Chris Finebone, said such members claimed to be the APC members  in the media by day and in another political party at night. Finebone spoke through a voice message sent to our correspondent on Sunday while reacting to the defection of a former commissioner for education in the state, Allwell Onyesoh from the APC to the Peoples Democratic Party. The state APC spokesman said Onyesoh was only exercising his right to free association, adding, “My reaction to Chief Allwell Onyesoh leaving the APC to the PDP is that he simply exercised his right to free association and none can fault that. “Some are in the APC on television and in the newspapers by day and in another party by night. They are the ones, who connived with the adversaries to destroy the party through judicial manipulation and outright betrayal. Placed side-by-side, Chief Onyesoh towers above them in principle,” Finebone added. The ex-commissioner for education described his defection to the PDP as homecoming. Copyright PUNCH.
