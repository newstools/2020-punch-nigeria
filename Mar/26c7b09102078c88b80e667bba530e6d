The Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, has ordered his field operatives to clamp down on overloaded school vehicles. This, he said, was part of efforts to reduce crashes involving vehicles conveying school children. Oyeyemi disclosed this in a statement signed by the Corps Public Education Officer, Mr Bisi Kazeem, on Saturday in Abuja. He directed Sector Commanders across the 36 states of the federation, including the Federal Capital Territory to impound any school bus carrying more than the required number of school children on the bus. He said, “This operation will be carried out in the morning and afternoon when schools close for the day.
