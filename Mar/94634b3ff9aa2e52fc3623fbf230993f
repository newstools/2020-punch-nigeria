Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State House of Assembly has approved Governor Dapo Abiodun’s request to restructure and refinance N109bn loan facilities obtained by his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun. Abiodun, who made the request in a letter to the Assembly, read by the  Speaker, Olakunle Oluomo, on Tuesday, said the loans were obtained between 2015 and 2017. He said there was a need to refinance the various loans in the debt stock of the state and provide financial relief to the state in managing its available resources and enhance infrastructural development. According to him, some  of the loans, as contained in the letter dated March 17, are Restructured Term Loan (FGN Bond) of N55, 405, 175, 055.11, obtained in 2015; Salary Bailout to State Government and Local Government of N9,779,580,234.86 and N9,139,628,430.00 respectively obtained in 2015 Others are: Infrastructural Loan (Excess Crude Account) of N10, 000, 000, 000.00, obtained in 2015; Special Socio-Economic Development Intervention Loan of N20, 000,000,000.00 obtained in 2017 and Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme of N5,000,000,000.00, obtained in 2017. The Majority Leader of the House, Yusuf Sheriff, moved the motion for the approval of the loans and it was seconded by the lawmaker representing Ijebu Ode State Constituency, Kemi Oduwole. Some of the lawmakers who contributed during the debate unanimously agreed that the move would allow the government to meet the shortfall in the price of crude oil at the international market. The shortfall, according to them, had impacted negatively on the global economy, thereby resulting in revenue downturn to governments at all levels in the country. Copyright PUNCH.
