Solape Lawal-Solarin Ex-Super Eagles striker, Daniel Amokachi, has revealed how he got his famous nickname ‘The Bull’, in an interview with beatsandrhymesfc.com. Amokachi enjoyed a decade of success with the national team after making his debut at the 1990 AFCON finals, going on to win the AFCON in 1994 and the Olympics in 1996, as well as representing Nigeria at two World Cups. The former Everton star disclosed that former Eagles coach, Clemence Westerhof, who handed him his Eagles debut, was the one that nicknamed him ‘The Bull’ after impressing the Dutchman. “Westerhof gave me that name. I remember when he picked me up when I was 16 and there were big players playing who were in their 20s and were pros already. “He just told me ‘go in there and bully them,’ and I go in there and do my stuff, and then he said ‘you know why I call you The Bull? Because you charge those defenders and anybody that you see in front of you.” Amokachi played 44 times for Nigeria, scoring 13 goals in the process. Copyright PUNCH.
