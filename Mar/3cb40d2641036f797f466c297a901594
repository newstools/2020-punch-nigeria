Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Senate on Wednesday mandated its Committee on Works to immediately summon the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, to explain the deplorable state of a major highway in the North-East geopolitical zone of the country. Fashola is expected to explain the abandonment of Mararaba-Mubi-Michika-Madagali road rehabilitation project in Adamawa State which is threatening the development of communities in the area. The action followed a motion sponsored by Senator Ishaku Abbo (Adamawa North). He informed his colleagues that despite the payment of over N1.2bn to Rhas Nigeria Limited two years ago to rehabilitate the road, the project had been abandoned. Copyright PUNCH.
