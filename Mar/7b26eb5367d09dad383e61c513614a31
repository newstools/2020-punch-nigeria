Success Nwogu, Abuja The Governor, District 9125, Rotary International, Dr Victor Onukwugha, has urged the Federal Government to restrict people from coronavirus-ravaged countries from coming to Nigeria. Onukwugha  said there should be more control at the borders to stop  the virus from spreading  in the country. He spoke in an interview with journalists in Abuja on Wednesday on the sidelines of the groundbreaking ceremony  for  the  Sir Emeka Offor Rotary Hall at the Abuja Rotary Centre. Onukwugha said Nigeria would  be certified polio-free on June 23. He said, “On coronavirus, we must have to look at our borders again. We have to restrict entry from those countries (with coronavirus). That is what we should achieve. Right now, we are not doing that. “We have wiped out polio for sure in Nigeria. By June 23 we will be certified a polio-free country. “We still have polio in Afghanistan and  until the last patient is cured we cannot rest even when we do not have it anymore in Nigeria. We must also do post-eradication survival. We must continue to do immunisation to ensure that it does not come back again.” Chairman of the   foundation,   Emeka Offor, said people should adopt better personal hygiene to avoid contracting coronavirus. Offor, who bankrolled the N70m 1,000 capacity hall, said people should encourage  the measures put in place by the Federal Government to address coronavirus spread. A former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, called for collaborative efforts to stop coronavirus in the country. He said, “Let every person practise personal hygiene and be careful. The government cannot do everything for us. We should do some for ourselves.” Copyright PUNCH.
