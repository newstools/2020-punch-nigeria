He advanced the reason for the establishment of the 63 Brigade in Asaba, saying the strategic position of the state to the sea borders made it imperative for the army to set up the brigade in the state. “The establishment of the brigade is as a result of strategic reasons. Delta is open to the sea and the military has a role like the navy to complement the security in the sea borders. The army will continue to partner with other security agencies in the country to ensure that the country is secured” he said. Buratai appreciated the efforts of the state government in supporting military operations in the state, promising that the army will reciprocate the state government’s gestures by ensuring that the state is free of crimes.
