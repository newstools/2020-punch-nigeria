Success Nwogu, Abuja Peter Obi on Wednesday decried the nation’s rising debt profile, accussing the Major General Muhammadu Buhari  government  of embarking on reckless borrowing”. In  a statement by his media aide,  Valentine Obienyem, the Peoples Democratic Party vice-presidential  candidate for  last year’s presidential election,  also expressed concern  over the  debt position of the country. According to him, financial borrowing is not entirely bad if the money  is used  judiciously. The former Anambra State governor  however said   borrowing without any convincing business plan  meant mortgaging the future. He said, “Everybody knows my stand on borrowing. I am against reckless borrowing and borrowing for consumption. If you must borrow, you must be able to convincingly prove to us the business case of the borrowing, otherwise you are mortgaging the future. “All the funds that have been borrowed have not impacted positively on the growth of  the  economy, meaning that they were reckless and meant for consumption. Even using  Kenya and  Ghana, for example, both are borrowing like us, but see the difference, “In 2010 Ghana’s GDP  (gross domestic product ) was $32bn, with a per capita of $1320. By  2019  the  GDP had grown to $64.5bn, with a per capita of $2,200. Kenya in 2010 had GDP of $42bn, a per capita of $912. In 2019 it was $87bn with a  per capita of $1700, while Nigeria had a per capita of $2,320 in 2010 and  in 2919 with all the borrowing it was $1,920.” Copyright PUNCH.
