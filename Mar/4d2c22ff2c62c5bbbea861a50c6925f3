Samuel Awoyinfa The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers has called on employers in the oil and gas sector to provide enough safety measures as the coronavirus pandemic becomes more virulent across the globe. The union made the call on Monday in a statement signed by the President, Williams Akporeha, a copy of which was made available to our correspondent. Akporeha urged the employers to create a conducive and safe environment for their workers. He also appealed to the members of the union to embrace safety precautions and maintain social distancing so as to minimise the spread of the deadly virus. Akporeha said that it was a trying period. He said, “The union understands this is a stressful time and people want to know what they can do right now to protect themselves and their families. “We therefore use this medium to encourage everyone to follow the directives laid down by both state and federal authorities in the health sectors. “We also urge all employers in the oil and gas industry to provide enough safety gears and create a conducive and safe environment.” He urged employers to ensure that workers in various oil and gas installations across the country adhered to high safety standards.
