Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi and Okechukwu Nnodim The Airline Operators of Nigeria has asked the Federal Government to take urgent steps to stop the spread of coronavirus by immediately announcing a comprehensive travel restriction to only two entry points in the country. The AON said on Tuesday that the entry points into the country should be reduced to Lagos and Abuja airports only. The group said the restriction should include Nigerian travellers coming into the country and foreign nationals of countries that had been confirmed to have over 100 cases of the COVID-19. The Chairman, AON, Capt. Nogie Meggison, lamented that Nigeria was about the only country in Africa yet to take a decisive action in putting in place strict measures to stop the inflow of the virus. He said, “We can say for sure that if the situation escalates in Nigeria, other countries of the world would not hesitate to stop us from flying into their countries. “We would like to appeal to the government to stand tall by putting Nigeria first at this time and take an immediate action by restricting travel into Nigeria.” Meggison said the restriction would allow for effective deployment of critical medical support staff and utilisation of thermal scanners by the Port Health Services. Meanwhile, the Federal Government on Tuesday announced the suspension of its planned national aviation conference as a result of the outbreak of the coronavirus. Copyright PUNCH.
