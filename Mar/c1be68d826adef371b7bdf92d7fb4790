Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Defence Headquarters, Abuja, has  said  the fighter jets deployed by Operation Lafiya Dole killed scores of Islamic State of West Africa Province/Boko Haram leaders and  fighters in Alinwa,  Borno State. The acting Director, Defence Media Operations, Brig Gen Bernard Onyeuko,  said in a  statement  on Friday the jets  bombed leaders of the terrorist  groups  during a meeting in a cluster of buildings in the area. He said the air offensives would be sustained in the identified terrorists’ hideouts. Onyeuko said, “This was achieved during the ongoing subsidiary Operation Decisive Edge  in another successful air interdiction mission on Thursday. “The airstrikes were executed on the heels of impeccable intelligence reports indicating that some top ISWAP commanders and  some of their fighters and designated suicide bombers had assembled at the location for a meeting aimed at orchestrating coordinated attacks against a number of targets in Borno State and  its environs. “Operation Lafiya Dole therefore dispatched its fighter jets to the location, recording devastating hits on many of the structures housing the ISWAP leaders and fighters, destroying them and neutralising their occupants.” Meanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai, on Friday decorated three newly promoted officers at the Army Headquarters. They were two Regimental Sergeant Majors – Agbo Nwabueze, Tijani Nambadi – promoted to the rank of Captain and a Master Warrant Officer – Zakaria Ibrahim –elevated to the rank  of  Regimental Sergeant Major.
