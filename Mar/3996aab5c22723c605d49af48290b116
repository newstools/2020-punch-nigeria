Addressing member of the diplomatic corps during an interactive parley on the new visa regime in Abuja on Thursday, Ehanire assured the foreign diplomats that the measures put in place by the FG would contain the spread of the disease, noting that “there was no immediate reason for now to impose a travel ban.” He said the country is guided by the World Health Organisation guideline on coronavirus containment.
