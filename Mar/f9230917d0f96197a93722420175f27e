John Charles, Makurdi The Benue State Government on Saturday confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus disease otherwise known as COVID-19. Governor Samuel Ortom disclosed this while briefing journalists in Makurdi, the state capital, shortly after the announcement by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control. He gave the name of the patient as “Susan Okpe”, who returned from the United Kingdom, adding that the state action committee had already commenced contact tracing of about eight persons. The governor explained that he disclosed the identity of the patient so that those who had made contact with her could take the necessary steps. He said the patient is presently being managed at the State Treatment Centre located at State University Teaching Hospital, Makurdi. The governor said he had ordered his deputy, Benson Abounu, to be tested for coronavirus. He said 70-year-old Abounu was at a recently held National Economic Council meeting in Abuja. The PUNCH reports that two attendees at the meeting tested positive for coronavirus. He said, “We are already tracing of all those Susan Okpe came in contact with. “In addition, samples of two other ladies have been collected but one among them turned to be negative to the virus. “I have also told my deputy governor to go for a test having returned from the National Economic Council meeting in Abuja even though he told me that he had no close contact with those suspected to have contracted the virus.” As of 04:29pm on Saturday, there are 89 cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria.
