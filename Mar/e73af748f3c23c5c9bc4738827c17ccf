Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Thursday arraigned Aisha Wakil, popularly called Mama Boko Haram, alongside two others on eight counts, bordering on fraud. This makes her and other defendants contending with cases of fraud before three judges in the state. The two other arraigned with her before Justice Umaru Fadawu of the Borno State High Court, Maiduguri, are senior members of her non-governmental organisation, Complete Care and Aid Foundation, Alhaji Saidu Daura and Prince Lawal Shoyode. Early this week, the trio, with another person at large, were charged before Justice Aisha Kumaliya of another Borno State High Court with N111.7m fraud. Wakil and Daura are facing corruption charges involving a N66m fraud before Justice Aisha Kumaliya. Early this year, Wakil, Daura, Shoyode and Mallam Adamu Sani (at large) were arraigned for N42m fraud before Justice Jude Dagat of a Federal High Court, Maiduguri.
