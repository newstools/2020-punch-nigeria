The Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Bayero, says the wishes of his late father, Ado Bayero, have materialised with his appointment and that of his brother as first-class Emirs. He said this while reacting to Governor Umar Ganduje’s comment on Wednesday that he had made history by appointing two blood brothers, Alhaji Aminu Bayero and Nasiru Bayero as Emirs of Kano and Bichi respectively. Ganduje made the remark while presenting appointment letters to the newly appointed Emirs at the Coronation Hall, Kano State Government House. “This is the first time in Nigeria or anywhere in Africa where two brothers are receiving appointment letters as first-class Emirs in the same state. They have indeed inherited the good work of their late father,  Alhaji Ado Bayero, who served as Emir for 53 years,” he said. In his remark, the new Emir of Kano promised to be respectful, loyal and obedient as they were taught by their late father, Alhaji Ado Bayero.
