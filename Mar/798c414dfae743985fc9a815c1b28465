Rasheed Bisiriyu Airbus has commenced test flights of the first A330-900 with the higher maximum take-off weight of 251t. An online aviation journal, flightglobal.com, reported the air framer as confirming that aircraft MSN1967 – bearing the test registration F-WWCE – lifted off from Toulouse at 12:27 local time on Friday February 28. Airbus has been aiming to deliver the higher-weight version of the A330neo, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, in mid-2020. The 251t version of the -900 variant will have a projected range of 7,200nm. Airbus lists two weight variants, the WV920 and WV921, at this MTOW with maximum landing weights of 191t. It also listed a 247t MTOW variant, designated WV922. Airbus’s current version of the A330-900 has an MTOW range of 230t up to the maximum of 242t, but the air framer confirmed in 2017 that it intended to develop a 251t variant – a modification which would also cover the A330-800. Cirium fleets data indicates that the aircraft carrying out the maiden flight is destined to be delivered to AirAsia X. Copyright PUNCH.
