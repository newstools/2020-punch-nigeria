John Alechenu, Abuja The National Vice Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (South South), Hilliard Eta, has urged party stakeholders in the zone to shun a consultative meeting scheduled for Thursday (today) at the instance of the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki. Eta made the call in Abuja on Wednesday. He said the governor did not carry along  party leaders from the zone to convene such a high-level meeting which, according to him, had only one agenda; how to get the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole out of office. Eta said, “I saw the invitation the governor is sending out to people inviting them for a meeting. But I am calling on all our party leaders to shun the meeting because he has no right to convene such meeting. I am the South-South Vice Chairman of the party and any APC leadership meeting is convened by me. “I have also communicated to our political leader in the zone, the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege and he is not aware of any such meeting. “So, we are calling on all our leaders not to attend any such meeting because it is ill conceived and ill motivated. At this point in time, we are focusing on how to strengthen our great party under the leadership of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and not to destabilise the party.” Meanwhile, the police and other security agencies have kept vigil on the party’s national secretariat, venue of the proposed emergency National Executive Council meeting scheduled to hold on Tuesday next week. Four police patrol vehicles were stationed at strategic locations around Blantyre Street where the party secretariat is located. Staff and visitors are still being screened before being allowed in.
