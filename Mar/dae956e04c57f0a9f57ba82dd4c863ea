Shola Shittu, Benin Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has sworn in Peter Aguele as new chairman of Esan South-East Local Government Area of the state. This  followed the judgment by the Edo State High Court, sacking  Victor Emuankhagbon and declaring Aguele  as the rightful winner of the All Progressives Congress’ January 24, 2018,   primary  election  for the  March 3, 2018, council  chairmanship poll. Aguele, who protested against    the conduct of the primary that produced Emuankhagbon, approached the court  to seek justice. He insisted that he was the rightful winner of the primary and should have been the party’s candidate for the chairmanship poll. He  urged  the court to declare him the winner of the primary and for the Edo State Independent Electoral Commission  to recognise him as such. In his judgment,  the presiding judge, Daniel Okungbowa, said the petitioner  was  the APC’s  rightful candidate for the election. Okungbowa said, “Therefore, the respondent should stop parading himself as the chairman of the council and he should refund  the money so far paid to him while in office as chairman of the council in the last two years to the treasury of the council.” He also  ordered that the petitioner should be paid the  entitlements due to him since 2018 as the rightful candidate and the elected chairman of the council. Obaseki, who congratulated Aguele, said his administration  had respect for  the rule of law. Copyright PUNCH.
