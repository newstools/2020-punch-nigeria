Johnny Edward Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has revealed that he has never thought of dumping the national team, adding that he is 100 per cent committed to his job. Rohr has three months left on his current deal and while he has received an offer for his contract renewal from the Nigerian Football Federation, money won’t be the topmost priority for him. The 67-year-old was linked with the Pharaohs of Egypt job last year before the Egyptian Football Federation appointed Hossam El Badry as the national team’s new head coach. “I will not be a candidate for any other country because simply, I still have a contract with Nigeria and it is not my kind of work to do that,” Rohr told Sports Extra in an exclusive interview. “If somebody is thinking of me, I am grateful, which means perhaps I am doing a good job and it is still better if somebody wants to take you than when people don’t want you. “They (NFF) are trying their best to honour my contract, but it is very difficult and it is still very difficult for them to honour it. “It’s not the money problem, my father told me and I always tell it to my children, ‘if you promise, you must do it.’ “The real problem I think the NFF has, this is the first country I see here in Africa where the sports ministry and the federation are not working together, in the other countries, I was paid by the sports ministry, they paid me. “I had the contract with the NFF and the sports ministry, here the NFF has to find alone the money to pay all the things.” Copyright PUNCH.
