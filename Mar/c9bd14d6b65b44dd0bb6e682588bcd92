Turkish football icon Fatih Terim, manager of Istanbul giants Galatasaray, said Monday he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. “The results of a test done today showed a positive result for coronavirus,” Terim said on Twitter. “I’m in safe hands at the hospital. Don’t worry. Hopefully, I’ll communicate more as soon as possible,” Terim added. Reacting to the development, Super Eagles attacker, Henry Onyekuru, tweeted, “I believe that you will be back stronger than before, my heart and prayers with you.” Dubbed “Emperor”, 66-year-old Terim, the former Turkish national boss, coached Galatasaray in three different stints (1996-2000, 2002-2004 and 2011-2013). He picked up the role for a fourth time in December 2017. Turkey has officially recorded 1,236 cases of the new coronavirus while 30 people have died, according to the health minister late Sunday. AFP
