Kayode Oyero The Lagos State Government has said it moved Nigeria’s first Coronavirus index case from Ogun State because it was a threat to Lagosians. The government said had the Italian national been left in Ogun State, it was only a matter of time before the infection spreads into Lagos. The state Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, who made this known on Sunday, said Lagos is a designated testing site for Coronavirus. Abayomi explained that though the COVID-19 patient was first discovered in Ewekoro area of Ogun State where he went for business at Lafarge Plc, the Italian national started his journey from Lagos when he arrived at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport from Milan, Italy. He said, “The patient started his journey from Lagos State before heading to Ogun State. Lagos is the designated testing site for Coronavirus. “If we had left the patient in Ogun State, the transmission was a matter of time. The longer you leave it, the more opportunity for transmission. So, it was critical for us to collaborate with Ogun State to bring the patient to Lagos for treatment. “Lagos State does not want an outbreak on its borders. Lagos and Ogun State are actually one contiguous community and if there was an opportunity for people to transmit the infection in a neighbouring state like Ogun State, definitely, Lagos would have become infected. “So, it was in our interest not only to support our neighbouring state but to protect ourselves. “We, in Lagos, are on the offensive, we are not on the defence – we are making sure that we do everything in our power to reduce the entrance of Coronavirus into Lagos.”
