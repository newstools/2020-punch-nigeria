Success Nwogu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party on Tuesday told  the  President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to address the country  on the  health  and safety  of those in the Presidential Villa following  the  COVID-19 pandemic. The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said  in a statement the public  was concerned about the  health issues in the Villa following reports that  Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, had tested positive  for coronavirus. He said  although  Buhari was reported to have tested negative, it  was  necessary to ease tension by addressing the  country. He said Nigerians, no matter how highly placed, should strictly adhere to directives by  the relevant agencies of government on health safety measures, particularly  relating  to the  isolation of persons returning from foreign trips. Ologbondiyan urged the Nigeria Centre  for Disease Control  and other  agencies to adopt stringent measures to isolate and monitor persons coming into the country as well as tracing  and  isolating those who had made contact with infected persons. He said, “In this regard, the NCDC should move into the Presidential Villa and immediately track and isolate all those who had made contact with President Buhari’s Chief of Staff, so as to check further spread of COVID-19 in our country. “We call on Nigerians to remain vigilant and observe all health safety directives, including social distances, self-isolation, personal hygiene and prompt report for medical assistance in the case of any symptoms.” The PDP expressed confidence  that “with a concerted effort by all Nigerians our nation will overcome the COVID-19 pandemic”.
