Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia The Abia State chapter of the All Progressive Grand Alliance has frowned on the appointment of a former Vice-Chancellor of Abia State University Uturu Mkpa, as the Chairman of the Abia State Independent Electoral Commission. The Abia State House of Assembly had screened and confirmed the nomination of Mkpa as ABSIEC chairman on Monday following his nomination by Governor Okezie Ikpeazu last Friday. But a statement by the APGA chairman in the state, Chief Nkem Okoro, stated that Mkpa was unfit for the appointment because of his alleged involvement in partisan politics. Okoro insisted that Mkpa was a card-carrying member of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state. He pointed out that Mkpa, who is also a former Secretary to the State Government under the PDP, would be biased and partisan because his loyalty would remain with his party and the government in power. The statement read in part, “Mkpa’s attempt to deny his alliance and loyalty to the PDP has shown him as a man without integrity who would not be able to stand his ground and speak the truth in times of pressure even as an electoral boss.” Copyright PUNCH.
