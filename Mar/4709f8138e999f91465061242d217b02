Tony Okafor, Awka The Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission on Tuesday said there was corruption in the handling of constituency projects across the country. It called for the involvement of traditional rulers and other stakeholders in monitoring such projects in their areas to reduce corruption. At a town hall meeting organised by the commission in conjunction with the National Orientation Agency, the ICPC zonal commissioner in charge of Anambra, Enugu and Ebonyi states, Mr Amodu Sule, said the rate at which constituency projects fail was alarming. Sule said, “Constituency projects are selected by legislators and provided for in the budgets of government’s ministries and agencies for execution, whereas there are other projects that are developed and implemented directly by the executive arm of government. “There is therefore the need for the beneficiaries to show interest in the selection, execution and use of these projects. In other words, there is need to take ownership of the projects for sustainability in the long term. “The constituency and other projects are funded by government with public money, which means that they are not gifts or donations to communities by political representatives. They belong to the people as fruits of national resources and government responsibility to the people.” Copyright PUNCH.
