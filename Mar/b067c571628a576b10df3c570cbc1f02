’Tosin Oluwalowo Enyimba’s hopes of qualifying for the semi-final of the CAF Confederation’s Cup were dashed on Sunday, as they lost 2-0 away to Horoya in Conakry. The Guinean side won the tie 3-1 on aggregate after holding Enyimba to a 1-1 draw at the Aba Township Stadium on March 1. Nigerian forward Bolaji Sakin scored the first goal in the 27th minute, curling the ball to the far post from the edge of the area after Enyimba failed to clear a corner. Both teams went into half-time with Enyimba on the brink of elimination. The second half started where the first ended, with Stanley Dimgba failing to connect well with a corner in the 65th minute. While Enyimba were seeking for an equaliser, Boubacar Samassekou doubled the lead for the home side, thumping in a header past the keeper after running to the edge of the six-yard box to connect a corner kick.
