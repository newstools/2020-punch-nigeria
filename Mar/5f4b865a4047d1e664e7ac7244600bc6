In a video posted online, Olopade said he had been in self-isolation since he realised he had symptoms of the deadly virus. “A few days ago I did make a video that I have been tested for COVID-19, I did promise to make it public once it was done and it has come out a couple of hours ago, that I tested positive for COVID-19,” Olopade said in a video he posted on Thursday. “As you all know, it’s not a death sentence, it’s not the end of the world, I feel no symptoms, I feel great and I feel healthy. But I have been called in and I have packed my stuff ready to go in for observation and by the special grace of God, I will come out with a clean bill of health.” READ ALSO: Weep not for Abba Kyari and Co The Chief Executive Officer of Nilayo Sports Management, however, advised the general public to adhere strictly to the government directive that people should stay at home and observe the social distancing due to the outbreak of the deadly virus. “Please stick to all the advice by the government and the World Health Organisation.
