Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has threatened to issue a warrant of arrest for the Executive Secretary of Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency, Mr Abdulkadir Seidu, if he fails to appear before its Committee on Finance for the third time. The committee had summoned the PPPRA boss over the failure by the agency to remit revenue between 2014 and 2019. The committee is investigating the non-remittance of revenue to the Federation Account by ministries, departments and agencies of the Federal Government. Chairman of the committee, Mr James Faleke, issued the threat at an investigative hearing in Abuja on Tuesday, after dismissing officials of the agency who represented him. Seidu has, therefore, been asked to appear before the committee on March 30. Meanwhile, the Chairman, House Committee on Public Accounts, Mr Wole Oke, on Tuesday summoned a former Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority, Mr Habib Abdullahi; and Director of Finance and Accounts of the authority to appear before the committeeÂ  within seven days for failing to audit the account of the NPA for four years.
