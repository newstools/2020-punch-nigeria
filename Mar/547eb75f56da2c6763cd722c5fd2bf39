Seun Adesoye The Director General of the Lagos State Safety Commission, Lanre Mojola, has urged the market men and women of Kairo Market, Oshodi, to protect themselves against coronavirus and other airborne diseases by being safety-conscious. The director general made the statement over the weekend during his visit to the market. He said, “To remain healthy and avoid contracting the disease and any other disease, you have to imbibe the habit of regular hand washing, as well as washing your hands after using the toilet, sneezing and coughing, and also before and after eating. It is also advised to take a lot of fruits to build immunity against the coronavirus disease, now known as COVID-19.” Mojola advocated the use of hand sanitisers and keeping a safe distance from anyone coughing or sneezing. The safety boss added that people with any of the symptoms should desist from self-medication and report to government hospitals for free medical checks and treatment. “Market sanitation is a critical factor in protecting the health of residents and the government will do everything possible to ensure hygiene in markets across the state,” he added.
