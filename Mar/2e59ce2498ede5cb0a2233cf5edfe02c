At the resumption of last Monday’s sitting of the House, some members had reportedly disrupted the sitting over alleged plans to remove the former Emir. The sitting was disrupted when a committee saddled with the responsibility to investigate Sanusi was about to submit its report to the House. The committee’s report was said to have recommended the dethronement of the former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
