Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Thursday charged road transport operators to review their transportation costs downwards. According to the government, this would be a way of reciprocating the Federal Government’s gesture after it reduced the pump price of petrol from N145 per litre to N125 per litre. The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who gave the charge in Abuja, said this would ensure that Nigerians enjoyed the benefit from the reduction in the price of petrol. He said, “I call on all Nigerians, particularly operators of commercial vehicles to follow the compassionate example of the Federal Government by reviewing the price of their services downward so that all Nigerians may benefit.” The minister, who also spoke about the coronavirus pandemic, encouraged Nigerians to endure the challenges such as the persistent decline in crude oil prices posed by the disease. Sylva said, “I would like to call on Nigerians to continue to endure even as we are all confronted with very intimidating challenges.” The Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency on Thursday cautioned fillings stations against selling petrol above N125 per litre, as it observed that some outlets had yet to comply with the directive. President of the Nigerian Labour Congress, Aliyu Wabba, on the other hand, commended the Federal Government for reducing the petrol price. However, he asked the government to tackle the major challenge by ensuring that Nigeria refined what it consumed. Copyright PUNCH.
