Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, says the state government will make agriculture a major revenue earner for the state in view of the dwindling revenue from oil. Wike made this remark at the Government House in Port Harcourt on Thursday during a courtesy visit by the Ambassador of Kingdom of the Netherlands to Nigeria, Harry Van Dijk. The governor said that the state government would partner the Kingdom of Netherlands to build its agricultural base. “We are going into agriculture in order to diversify the economy of the state. We want to partner investors from your country to develop agriculture and create employment opportunities for our people. “With the price of oil crashing, it is necessary to get alternative sources of income. We know that Netherlands is good in aquaculture and we will collaborate in that area,” Wike said. The governor noted that his administration had improved security to ensure that investors operated freely without hindrance. Earlier, the Kingdom of the Netherlands envoy, Mr Harry Van Dijk, said he was in the state to inspect the ongoing clean-up in Bodo City. Van Dijk added that the Government of Netherlands was willing to discuss areas of partnership with the Rivers State Government for the development of the state. Copyright PUNCH.
