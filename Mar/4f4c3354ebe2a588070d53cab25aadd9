Therefore, candidates should disregard rumours making the rounds that the results have been cancelled. “The results of the first day were placed on the website and some fraudulent individuals were coping and manipulating it to deceive unsuspecting candidates. Hence, our decision to move it to the mobile platform for candidates to use their unique phone numbers used in registering for the examination to access their results. “The result of the over 450,000 candidates who sat on Tuesday will also be released before 12 noon on Wednesday. The results of the examination will continue to be released as the examination is taken. “In few days, we will be concluding the 2020 exercise and we urge the candidates to be vigilant as many fraudsters who could not operate, given the security measures put in place to secure our system, will want to use every opportunity of information gap to defraud or mislead unsuspecting candidates.”
