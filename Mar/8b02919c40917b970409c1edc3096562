Meanwhile,the NCC has said it has no mandate to arrest SIM card registration defaulters in the country. NCC, however, said with collaboration with security agencies, culprits could be apprehended and prosecuted for multiple registration of SIM cards with bad intent. The NCC Executive Vice- Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta, said this at the ongoing 41st Kaduna International Trade Fair in Kaduna. Danbatta was represented by Amina Shehu, who is the Director of Zonal Services of the NCC. On the issue of multiple SIM card registration, Danbatta said the commission, through its Compliance, Monitoring and Enforcement Department, would do the needful by collaborating with security agencies. He said, “There are laws on the registration of SIM cards. We have a department in the organisation called Compliance, Monitoring and Enforcement. “That department is to enforce and make sure that all networks or individuals that don’t register or register wrongly with an intent to commit crime are death with. Once we get hold of them, we work with the security operatives. “Because we don’t have the mandate to do what the security operatives are doing, we do effective collaboration with the security operatives to nab some of these people. It’s not within our mandate to do the arrest. Ours is to ensure that registration of SIM card is done.” Copyright PUNCH.
