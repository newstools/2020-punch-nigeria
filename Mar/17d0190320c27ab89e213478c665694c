John Alechenu, Abuja National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, sang a conciliatory tune on Tuesday when he enjoined his colleagues in the National Working Committee to put the interests of Nigerians first. He also suggested that the first post-crisis NWC should be devoted to “having a conversation around the coronavirus”. Oshiomhole, holding his ‘rival’  Victor Giadom, said, “If it is one hour that we spend here, let us have a conversation around this issue.” READ ALSO: Coronavirus: Chad records no case, shuts airports, borders According to him, it should be an issue of concern that other countries were closing their international borders to contain the spread of the virus but Nigeria has yet to follow suit. He explained that recent challenges the party had had to deal with were normal in a democratic setting. Oshiomhole said, “Party Politics is about contestations. I am not the best chairman in the world and I don’t claim to be so, you can fault my style but you cannot fault my sincerity. “The NWC is not divided. None of us seated here wants to destroy our party. My style is my style but I’ve learnt to reconcile my style with the style of others.” The meeting, which is underway had most members of the 21 member NWC irrespective of which side they took during the crisis in attendance.
