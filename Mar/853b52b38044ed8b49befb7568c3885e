Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Government has placed total ban on all political, social and religious gatherings in the state for 14 days, as part of the efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus. The decision of the government would definitely affect the state congress of the Peoples Democratic Party coming up on Tuesday (today). This was part of the decisions made at the state executive council meeting held on Monday. The state Commissioner for Information, Mr Donald Ojogo, read the deliberations of the meeting to journalists. The government also said the decision was part of the measures to stem the rampaging menace. He said, “The government wishes to encourage the PDP in Ondo State to consider postponing its state congress scheduled for Tuesday, 24th March, 2020 and take a cue from the Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, who by public apology,  agreed that the party did not exercise discretion by organising a political rally in Ibadan.” According to the commissioner, the government also banned gatherings at clubs, beer parlours and joints in the state until further notice. “All civil servants at Grade Levels 01 to 12, except those on essential duties as may be determined by their respective accounting officers and chief executives, are hereby advised to stay at home for now. “Government, as well as all persons of goodwill in Ondo State, no doubt, heaved a sigh of relief when a few days ago, our collective anxiety became calm only after the result conducted on a suspected COVID-19 case turned out negative,” he added. Responding, the PDP said it agreed with the government decision. Copyright PUNCH.
