Here you can see the military, the police and civil society who are members have come together in this venture. “It is a good sign that things will improve, we are here to complement the efforts of the Federal Government in fighting insurgency, unemployment and poverty. “It is not over until we take at least 100 million Nigerians out of poverty.”
