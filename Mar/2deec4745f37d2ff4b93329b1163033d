Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Miners Association of Nigeria on Monday ordered its members to halt all mining operations across the country immediately. It gave the directive following the continued spread of coronavirus, stressing that mining activities were mostly domiciled in rural communities that lacked health and other basic amenities. In a notice to miners nationwide, which was signed by the association’s National President and National Secretary, Kabiru Mohammed and Dele Ayanleke respectively, the body said everyone must work together to halt the spread of the virus. It said, “It is in the light of the above that the National Executive Council of miners’ association hereby directs all our members across the nation to close all mining operations forthwith until the nation survives this global emergency.” The association also appealed to other non-member miners to heed the directive in the overall national interest.
