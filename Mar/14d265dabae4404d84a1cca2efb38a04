Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The federal and state governments should start moving water to slums and other vulnerable areas to further help combat the spread of coronavirus, a civil society organisation, WashMata Initiatives, stated on Sunday. Executive Director of the organisation, Boluwaji Onabolu, said it was time for the government to also rehabilitate non-functional water supplies in rural communities as the lack of access to water could derail efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. She said, “Government should immediately activate the WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) procedures used for humanitarian and disaster response in collaboration with the National Emergency Management Agency, ministries of water resources, rural water and sanitation agencies, as well as relevant NGOs. “Government should truck in water to vulnerable areas, slums, markets, health facilities and initiate urgent rehabilitation of non-functional water supplies for communities, healthcare facilities as well as emergency trucking in of water to the urban slums, rural poor and markets.” Onabolu, an environmental health expert, noted that the use of sanitisers and the practice of personal hygiene were not feasible solutions if the large proportion of urban poor did not know what a sanitiser was.
