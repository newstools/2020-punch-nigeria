Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The faction of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ogun State loyal to Senator  Buruji Kashamu has denied that there is a court order that stopped the congresses of the party. A factional State Publicity Secretary of the party,  Sunkanmi Oyejide,  said this in a statement on Wednesday. The party had proposed to hold its ward congress across the state on Saturday. The PDP in the state has two groups;  one led by Sikirulahi Ogundele and the other by Bayo Dayo, which are loyal to Oladipupo Adebutu and Kashamu, respectively. The Dayo-led PDP said the information that a court in Abuja had granted an order to stop its group from holding its scheduled ward, local government and state congresses in the state was false. The statement read in part, “Nothing could be farther from the truth. “No court granted such or any order for that matter. If they claim anything to the contrary, we challenge them to show the whole world the said court order!

The court said the processes should be served on us. “We were served yesterday (Tuesday) and our counsel, Ajibola Oluyede, appeared in the matter today (Wednesday)and filed a preliminary objection to the suit. “The court refused to make any order but advised parties not to do anything that will destroy the ‘res’ (substance) of the case.” Copyright PUNCH.
