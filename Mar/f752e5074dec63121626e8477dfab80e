Seun Adesoye Alumni of Queen’s School Ibadan, under the aegis of the Queen’s School Old Girls’ Association, have said they  planned to immortalise the late Dr Ameyo Adadevoh with a N250m multi-purpose building in her alma mater. In a statement on Sunday to commemorate the 2020 International Women’s Day, the old students’ association hailed the late Adadevoh for sacrificing her life in 2014 to stop the deadly Ebola virus from being spread in Nigeria by a Liberian, Patrick Sawyer, who later died of the disease. The association said Adadevoh made history with her action which demonstrated “women’s ability to make the ultimate sacrifice.” The statement read in part, “Once again on this International Women’s Day and the current spread of the coronavirus,  COVID-19, we remember and honour our dear Ameyo,  and hope for a quick resolution of the coronavirus, COVID-19 health crisis. “Queen’s School Old Girls Association, with all alumni of the school worldwide, has put in place plans to immortalise her name by erecting a multi-purpose edifice in her alma mater at Queen’s School Ibadan, to motivate generations of students to come and to instill selfless service in the ‘girl child’ . “The N250m edifice launch’s date is Saturday, May 9, 2020, at the University of Ibadan Conference Centre, Ibadan.” The association said with her extraordinary accomplishment, Adadevoh shaped Nigeria’s health history. “Ameyo stood tall before the world. She saved Nigeria from the spread of the infectious Ebola disease, lost her life in the process but earned kudos for Nigeria from all over the world for stopping the virus from spreading,” the statement added.
