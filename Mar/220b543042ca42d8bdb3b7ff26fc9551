Wale Oyewole, Ibadan The Oyo State Government has indicated its readiness to review the allocation of Government Reserved Areas at Akitipiti, Oyo town and Oke Anu, Ogbomoso. This, according to the Commissioner for Lands, Housing and Urban Development, Abiodun Abdu-Raheem, is in fulfilment of the state government’s resolve to decongest Ibadan. AbdulRaheem, who spoke during visits to the GRAs in Oyo and Ogbomoso, disclosed that the said lands in the two towns had been allocated more than 10 years ago without any visible development. He noted that the lands in question, which could serve as sources of revenue for the state government, were being left to waste away. He said, “The allocations will be reviewed and revoked where necessary. What I see here is very disheartening. A lot of people are in need of land here and this can even help in boosting the revenue drive of the government.” Copyright PUNCH.
