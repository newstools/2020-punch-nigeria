Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Christians in Kaduna State on Tuesday said the state governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai’s apology over the security challenges has vindicated their cries on banditry and kidnapping which had led to death of innocent souls in the state. The Kaduna chapter Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Rev. Joseph Hayab, said this in  his reaction to the killing of over 50 persons by bandits  in two local government areas of state on Sunday. The governor had on Monday apologised to residents of communities attacked by the bandits in Igabi and Giwa LGAs. Hayab  in a statement titled, ‘At last el-Rufai  eyes open,’ said, “When CAN cried out over the incessant killings going on in the state, some people gave meanings to our cry and gave us different names for fighting the cause of humanity. “Our concern in time past and till now has been, let the common man on the street be safe and feel secured like any other person. “We are happy to see and hear the remorse of governor El-Rufai in reaction to the killings of innocent Nigerians in Igabi and Giwa local government areas as government’s inability to be able to properly ensure the safety of its citizens and the need for concerted efforts to be done to secure the people irrespective of who they are and where they come from.” Copyright PUNCH.
