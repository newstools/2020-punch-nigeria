Onyekachukwu Meluwa, Warri A 13-year-old boy, Progress Life, who allegedly stabbed his friend, Marvellous Ekrake, to death over a financial disagreement on Saturday in Ughelli, has been caught. The suspect disclosed details of what transpired between him and the deceased, adding that he had no intention of killing his friend. Life told journalists before he was whisked away by police officers that they had a disagreement over the sharing of N300 they were paid for a job. He said, “After we completed the job for the woman earlier that day, we were paid N300 and Marvellous decided to take N200, which I objected to as the money ought to be shared equally. But he insisted on the sharing formula because he was older. “Angered by this, I reported the matter to my father, who told me to allow him to take the money. Later that evening, while he was playing with our toy, I warned him to stop playing with the toy, which I collected from him and threw inside my father’s room with a threat that I would stab him if he went into the room to take it. “Despite my warning, Marvellous went into my father’s room to collect the toy and I stabbed him.” Copyright PUNCH.
