Anna Okon The Nigerian Ports Authority and the Nigeria Center for Disease Control have agreed that the sixÂ  new cases of COVID-19 that were reported to have been discovered on a ship by the NCDC were found on an oil rig, Siem Marlin. The rig was stationed offshore on the high seas and was accessed by helicopter by the Lagos State Government and NCDC. This was disclosed in a statement signed by the General Manager, Corporate and Strategic Communication, NPA, Mr Adams Jatto on Friday. The center had released an update showing the latest confirmed cases of COVID-19. It stated that Lagos had 12 new cases and six of them were found on a vessel. NPA however disagreed, asking for details of the vessel and the patients, saying the Port Health Services and NPA had recorded no case so far. The two parties, NPA and NCDC held a meeting on Friday, where the centre clarified the update and said the six patients were found on the oil rig. NPA said the clarification was necessary because stakeholders had expressed concern after seeing the update. It noted that the concern would not have been so profound if the cases were reported to have been found on a rig. Copyright PUNCH.
