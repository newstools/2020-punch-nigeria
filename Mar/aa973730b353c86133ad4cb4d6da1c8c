Mamora said, “Following my contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, I went into self-isolation. Testing was carried out on me yesterday (Wednesday) and the result came back negative this morning (Thursday).” The PUNCH reports that many ministers have gone into self-isolation since reports emerged that the President’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, and three of his aides tested positive for coronavirus. Kyari also attended the Federal Executive Council meeting last week as well as meetings with All Progressives Congress’ governors.
