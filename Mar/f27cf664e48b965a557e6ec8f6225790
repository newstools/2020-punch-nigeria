Solape Lawal-Solarin Former Watford striker, Odion Ighalo, has silenced his critics with his impressive displays in Manchester United colours ever since making a transfer deadline day move to Old Trafford from Shanghai Shenhua. The 30-year-old was at the receiving end of unending criticisms from former United stars and pundits alike, following the move. However, after backing up his performances with goals, one of his doubters, former United defender, Rio Ferdinand, admits he has been forced to eat his words. “Eight games, three starts, four goals and one assist. All you people saying ‘What are we doing signing him?’ I was one of them, I have to admit it. “He has proved us all wrong. It is refreshing to see someone like a supporter; he looks delighted to be there, like he is saying thank you every day to Ole. “Marcus Rashford will appreciate playing with someone like this when he is fit again. He has got something different to all the other guys in the team. “He is something different if it is not going our way in games. He has affected games every time he has come on the pitch, that is what I like,” he told  The Mirror. Copyright PUNCH.
