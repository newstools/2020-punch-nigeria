Kayode Idowu The Nigerian Army on Saturday said it had smashed Boko Haram food supply line and destroyed six vehicles used in conveying food and logistics to the hideouts of the terrorist group in Lake Chad and Sambisa Forest. The Acting General Officer Commanding, 7 Division, Nigerian Army, Brig-Gen. Abdul Ibrahim; who supervised the symbolic destruction of the intercepted vehicles and materials, said four persons were arrested when the vehicles were intercepted. He told journalists in Maiduguri, Borno State, on Saturday that the intercepted vehicles comprised four pickup trucks and two Peugeot station wagons. He said the arrested suspects include Abubakar Sadik, Fannami Modu and Modu Chellu of various addresses within Maiduguri. He said intelligence reports showed that the arrested suspects indulged in supplying Boko Haram with logistics from Maiduguri. “They have always transported food and logistics to the terrorist group in their enclaves in Sambisa Forest and Lake Chad region. “Despite warnings, some of them still continue with the illicit and illegal business of supplying logistics and other materials to Boko Haram,” he added. He said the destruction of materials and logistics would act as a deterrent to those doing business with Boko Haram. Copyright PUNCH.
