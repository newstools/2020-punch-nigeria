James Abraham, Jos A 20-year-old man, Mr Isaac Boniface, is in police custody for allegedly defiling a four-year-old girl in the Dahwol community, Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State. The suspect, who claimed to be working with a mattress manufacturing firm, was among the over 22 suspected criminals paraded by the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Isaac Akinmoyede, for various offences at the command’s headquarters in Jos on Wednesday. Boniface, who confessed to defiling the victim, told our correspondent that he committed the act because the little girl was his friend. He said, “My name is Isaac Boniface and I live in the same compound with the girl and her mother. Anytime I was going to work or passing by, the girl would greet me and I would greet her back because we are friends.
