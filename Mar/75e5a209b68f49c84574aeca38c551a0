A statement said while speaking at the event, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, African Alliance Insurance, Mrs Funmi Omo, congratulated the winners but charged them not to relent on their oars. She stated, “Our premium income rose by 45 per cent year on year in 2019 and we are successfully growing a retail market that is sure to bloom. We can and we will do more this 2020. “It is a new start and a brand new opportunity to do even more work. We will not leave you to it, you can rest assured of the management’s continued support towards achieving your budgets.” Reiterating the management’s position, the Head of Agency Operations, African Alliance Insurance, Victor Peters, encouraged the team to build up their capacity to sell more by identifying new markets, digging further into already identified ones and strategic recruitments across the sales force. The statement said 26 awards were presented to deserving agents, unit managers and agency managers from all over the country. Mary Akwamanti (Ilupeju Area) won the gold trophy for being the best Agent in first year premium income based on product line, while Lucky Aigbogun (Asaba Area) won the silver trophy as the top agent in renewal premium income.
