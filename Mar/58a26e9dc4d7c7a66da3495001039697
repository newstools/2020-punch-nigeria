Sodiq Oyeleke The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has no hand in the dethronement of Lamido Sanusi as the Emir of Kano, says a spokesperson for the president, Garba Shehu. He said this in a series of tweets on Wednesday. The Kano State Government had on Tuesday deposed Sanusi and immediately appointed Aminu Ado Bayero as his successor. Shehu debunked insinuations that the president approved the sacking of the Emir. The presidential spokesperson said that it was within the jurisdiction of governors to appoint and remove Emirs. He tweeted, “President Muhammadu Buhari has no involvement whatsoever in the dethronement of HRH Muhammadu Sanusi II from the position of Emir of Kano.

On such matters which impinge on national security, he has a duty of involvement as the law stipulates. “As outlined in the Constitution, the appointment or removal of emirs and other traditional leaders is strictly within the jurisdiction of state governments. “It is unfair and disingenuous of opposition politicians to try to link the situation in Kano State to the federal government and the Nigerian President.
