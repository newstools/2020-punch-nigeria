Diri spoke at his Sampou-Kalama ward 6 in the Kolokuma-Opokuma Local Government Area after participating in the PDP ward congresses in the state on Saturday. He urged the ward leaders to accommodate them and wind up the opposition in the ward. Diri noted that the new spirit of unity and consensus building in the PDP had put the party in good stead to win future elections in the state.

He said, “So much is expected of you both in character and as executive members of your wards. You are carrying the image of the governor before your peers and executive committee members from other wards in Bayelsa.” Copyright PUNCH.
