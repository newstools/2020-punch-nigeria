Wale Oyewale, Ibadan A group within the All Progressives Congress in Oyo State, APC Reformers, comprising former political appointees and elected officials under the administration of former Governor Abiola Ajimobi, on Thursday, described as a waste the recently inaugurated reconciliation committee led by a former governor of the state, Chief Adebayo Alao-Akala. The group, in a statement on Thursday, after an emergency meeting held in Igbeti, described the Ajimobi committee as dead on arrival. The statement read that the latest move by Ajimobi, National Vice Chairman of the APC, was a great joke in the unfolding drama within the APC in Oyo State. According to the statement signed by the Deputy Coordinator of the group, Wasiu Olatunbosun, it is curious to imagine why a culprit will become a judge in his own case. It added that Ajimobi and some members of the newly inaugurated committee played significant roles in the events that led to the crisis in the party. It read further that the recent antics of Ajimobi affirmed that “he lacked the moral justification to call for reconciliation,” adding that Ajimobi was insincere and had the habit of ‘use-and-dump’ just as he allegedly loves politics of deceits and self centeredness. It warned the members of the committee to learn from the experience of others and “refuse to be victims of Ajimobi’s antics.” It also urged the national leadership of the party, including the chairman of the APC national reconcillation committee, Chief Bisi Akande, to rescue the party in Oyo State against imminent collapse.
