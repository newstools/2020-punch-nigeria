Nigeria’s 43 ministers have donated 50 per cent of their March 2020 salaries to support the Federal Government’s efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. This was contained in a statement issued in Abuja on Saturday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed. The statement said the Minister of State for Transportation, Senator Gbemisola Saraki, coordinated the donation. Saraki was quoted as saying that the donation was a gesture of solidarity and support for the Federal Government’s efforts to tackle the disease. Saraki said, “This global virus outbreak will require nations, continents and smaller communities to pull together to contribute their resources and support one another. “This will facilitate an early resolution of the problem.” So far, Nigeria has recorded 89 confirmed cases of coronavirus.
