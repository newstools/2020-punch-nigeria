Kelvin Ekerete Former Trabzonspor president, Ozkan Sumer, has slammed the club for terminating the contract of Nigerian midfielder, Mikel Obi. The former Trabzonspor and Turkey coach also slammed the Turkish Football Federation for failing to call off the league insisting that they can’t guarantee a healthy condition for the players. Speaking to Trabzon-based website 61saat.com, the legendary coach said, “TFF cannot do anything if the players say ‘I am not playing’. It is cruel to condemn the player to play in a place where no one can guarantee health. It is the most natural right for footballers not to play in the current conditions. “One of the most objectionable priorities of the coronavirus is physical contact. Football is also a contact-based game. It is not possible to acknowledge what risk players are doomed in this regard.” Copyright PUNCH.
