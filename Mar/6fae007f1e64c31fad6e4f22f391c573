The Standards Organisation of Nigeria has lamented its inability to examine containers coming through the seaports as a way of stemming influx of substandard goods. The Head, Ports and Borders, SON, Yahya Bukar, stated this recently while addressing electronics dealers in Lagos. He  maintained that  the challenge faced by the standards body to address the influx of substandard goods was enormous. Bukar explained that in spite of the standards body’s connection to the Nigerian Integrated Customs Information System, the SON could only view documents on the platform, but could not examine containers easily except invited by the Customs. He said, “We sometimes view a document, but the information on the document is different from what we have in the container; most of the times, it is difficult to judge whether these goods meet our requirements since we do not have access to these containers and we cannot verify the declaration. “We also face another challenge where some clearing agents try to connive with the importers to circumvent the laws. “We expect these clearing agents to be the ones to explain things better to these importers.” Bukar stated that the SON was already prepared for the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement, but stressed the need for the organisation to be strategically positioned at the ports for Nigeria to be competitive when the trade deal would commence. “We will have a lot of advantages to monitor the products that are coming in if we are strategically positioned, but if we cannot monitor, all other African countries will subdue Nigeria with their own products. “If we can monitor these products coming in, we will be able to curtail the influx of substandard goods.” Copyright PUNCH.
