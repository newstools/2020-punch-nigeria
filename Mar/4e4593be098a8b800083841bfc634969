Samuel Awoyinfa The Cross River state-owned Calabar Garment factory says it has procured order for the production of 8,000 pairs of National Youth Service Corps’ uniforms. The garment factory is one of the industries established by Governor Ben Ayade in his first term, in line with the industrialisation policy of his administration. The state Commissioner for Industry, Peter Egba, said the factory was given eight days to produce the uniforms, a statement indicated. He explained that this was a product of the engagement it had with the authorities of the NYSC, adding that this would not only sharpened the skills of the workers but generate revenue for the state. He said, “For me, this order is a manifestation of the engagement we have had over time. It helps sharpen our skills; keeps the employees busy and generate revenue. “The Governor of Cross River State, Sir Ben Ayade, in establishing the garment factory, stated that the factory would be among those to decouple the state from overdependence on federal allocation.” Egba stated that the sophisticated machines at the factory greatly aided in meeting the NYSC order. “The NYSC brought their materials to us to make for them at the garment factory. Basically, the idea behind this was that they wanted to test our capabilities to deliver within a short period. That was why they gave us only eight days to deliver 8,000.” Copyright PUNCH.
