Solape Lawal-Solarin Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Ince believes Odion Ighalo would never have tried his outlandish goal if fans were in the stadium. United played against LASK in the Europa League behind closed doors in Austria on Thursday, which they won 5-0 in the round of 16 first leg. Only a handful of fans were in the stadium, meaning there was almost no noise. And Ince thinks it played a role in Ighalo taking a chance with an outlandish bit of control and then a thunderous finish. “It reminds me of one of those goals you try in training. If it’s a full house, I don’t know,” the former United star explained to BT Sport. “Maybe I’m doing a disservice to him, but I don’t know.” Copyright PUNCH.
