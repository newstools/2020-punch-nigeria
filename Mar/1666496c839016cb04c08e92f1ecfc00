Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, on Thursday, urged members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, Ebonyi State University chapter, to call off their warning strike. The governor said he would withhold their salaries and other entitlements if they failed to heed his call. He said this in a statement by the Secretary to the State Government, Kenneth Ugballa, in Abakaliki. Lecturers had since last week embarked on a strike, which they tagged “Active non-compliance strike action.” The Ebonyi State University chapter chairman of ASUU, Dr Ikechukwu Igwenyi, had said the union was forced to take the action because the school management failed to see reason. He said, “All the efforts we have been making to ensure that there is effective communication between ASUU and the management have not yielded fruit and so we decided to embark on what we call active non-compliance strike.” Responding, the state government said, “The Governor of Ebonyi State has appealed to the Academic Staff Union of Universities, Ebonyi State chapter, to please call off the strike and go back to work in the interest of the state. “The governor has personally intervened in the affairs and welfare of ASUU workers in the state and, only last year, a total of N1.5bn was paid to ASUU by the Ebonyi State Government for the accumulative demand of ASUU from the past administration.” While dismissing most of their demands as political, the statement said it “… backed the decision of management not to pay salaries to any lecturer who had not participated in the Bank Verification Number, ordered by the state government for all workers in the state.
