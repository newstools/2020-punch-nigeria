Tony Okafor, Awka Anambra medical doctors, under the aegis of Conference of Civil Service Doctors, have embarked on an indefinite strike. The doctors had about three months ago suspended an earlier strike action against the state government. They accused the state government of failure to adhere to an agreement signed with them some months back. Addressing newsmen at the General Hospital, Onitsha on Monday, the State Chairman of the civil servant doctors, Livinus Chukwuma, said, “This strike is necessitated by the failure of the state government to adhere to the agreement signed with us.” He said doctors in the state had earlier embarked on 13 months strike due to the failure of the state government to implement the Consolidated Medical Salary Structure as prescribed by the Federal Government as the standard for all doctors in the civil services. He said their earlier strike was suspended after intervention from “prominent persons in the state as well as an agreement reached, which stipulated that the government would periodically review the salaries until 100 per cent was achieved, starting from 50 per cent.”
