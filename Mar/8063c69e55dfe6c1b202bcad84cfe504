Samuel Awoyinfa A group, Grace Ladies Business International Ministry, has said it is set to assist over 2,000 women entrepreneurs across Nigeria with training and grants to take their businesses to the next level, noting that they are not getting enough assistance. The convener, Mrs Ayodeji Megbope, supported by other board members disclosed this at a media briefing to herald the ‘What next conference’ set to hold in May in Lagos. Megbope, who said this was the second edition of the programme, noted that the group was concerned about making more women have a balanced mix of thriving business/career and family life. She said, “This is a business fellowship, where we inspire and empower female entrepreneurs through skills acquisition, and counselling. “We also give seed money and grants to shore up their businesses and we ensure women are not idle. With this conference, we will make them to realise their dreams. It is a reality that women strive harder and they don’t seem to get enough assistance to shore up their businesses. “We are committed to raising balanced women who are balanced in their marriage, career or business. The theme is ‘Beauty for Ashes’.” Megbope said many of the women would acquire skills in baking, catering and other trades, having empowered no fewer than 700 women in the maiden edition in April last year. According to her, the keynote speaker is Nomthi Odukoya of the Fountain of Life Church while plenary session speakers would have founder and CEO of Ask Damz, Adedamola Ladejobi; Creative Director at Purple Lagos, Oyinda Lewis;  founder, Deborah Initiative for Women, Debola Deji Kurunmi, and Creative Director at Five28 Interiors Funto Ibuoye, among others.
