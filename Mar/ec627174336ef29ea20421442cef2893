Sola Shittu, Benin A leader of the All Progressives Congress in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, on Tuesday, said his house in Benin had been under surveillance by unidentified persons for possible attack. Ize-Iyamu who stated this while receiving the ‘Safe Edo Movement’ group which came to invite him to contest for the governorship of the state, said he would not be afraid of those who thought they could intimidate him. “My house has been surveyed several times for the purpose of throwing bombs. The Certificate of Occupancy of my house was threatened if I allow political function in my house. I choose to be in politics because the only way you can use resources for the people is to be in politics and if you want to have a say in the distribution of resources, you have to be in politics too,” he said.
