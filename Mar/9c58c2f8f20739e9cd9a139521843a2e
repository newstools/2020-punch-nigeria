Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development has met with stakeholders on the execution of improvement work on Allen roundabout, Ikeja. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako, told the stakeholders that the project was conceived as part of the strategy to enhance the flow of traffic across the state and ease the pains of commuters within the metropolis. He explained that the junction improvement initiative of the Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration, of which Allen junction improvement work was an example, was designed to reduce loss of man-hour, pollution and health risk. “There is no gainsaying the fact that as societies develop, it becomes imperative to overhaul and renew public infrastructure to accommodate and facilitate the growing conurbation,” he said. The commissioner, who was represented at the meeting by the ministry’s Director of Physical Planning, Bola Aliu, said the state government believed that through the Initiative, it would have gone a long way in making life easier and more meaningful for Lagosians by enhancing inter-connectivity within the state. He enjoined all stakeholders to give their support to the project by cooperating with the staff of the ministry and other agencies of government who would be working in the area for the realisation of the project.
