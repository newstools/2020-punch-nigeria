Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The Federal Capital Territory Enforcement Teams on COVID-19 on Sunday arrested the General Overseer of the Jesus Reigns Family Church, Apo, Pastor U. U. Uden, for violating the ban on places of worship. The team also shut the popular H-Medix Pharmacy in Wuse II, Abuja, following a complaint received by the FCT COVID-19 situation room. It was reported that the pharmacy was not using short-gun thermometer and other safety items required to safeguard customers and staff. Our correspondent gathered that the JRFC church was in full session when the enforcement team arrived. A source told our correspondent that the team waited for the pastor to conclude the worship before arresting him. The chairman of the taskforce, Ikharo Attah, confirmed the arrest. “He was immediately taken to the FCT Police Command, Garki and handed over to the policemen on duty. “The team also dispersed worshippers at the Christ Embassy Church, Jahi District in Abuja and 14 others at various parts of the FCT,” he added. Meanwhile, the Abuja Municipal Area Council on Sunday shut markets under the council for fumigation. The Executive Chairman, AMAC, Abdullahi Candido, said the fumigation, which started on Sunday, was to curb the spread of coronavirus. The markets are Utako, FHA Lugbe, Relocation Market Lugbe, Gwagwa, Nyanya, Aco mini, Jabi Park, Gwarinpa, Kugbo furniture, Kugbo spare part, Karshi, Karu and Apo Fish Market. Speaking with our correspondent after monitoring the exercise, the Public Relations Officer, Patience Olaloye, said, “The closure order would be reviewed after completing the fumigation.” Copyright PUNCH.
