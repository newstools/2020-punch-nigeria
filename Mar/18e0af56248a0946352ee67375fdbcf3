’Tosin Oluwalowo Former Golden Eaglets coach, Emmanuel Amuneke, has refuted reports he has been sacked by Egyptian side El-Makkasa. There were reports that the former Nigeria international, who took charge of the club less than a month ago, was relieved of his duties after only three games incharge. He, however, said, the club only assigned him with another responsibility. “Nobody sacked anybody. It’s just that this Makkasa club is a big outfit with a big company and they have their project through their government here and the government is encouraging them to invest in other African countries and Nigeria is in their plan,” Amuneke said. “They are starting in Tanzania and later, they will go to Mali. Nigeria is part of their plan and I hope when the time comes, we would be here. “It’s just that they want me to help through the government. My name and Abedi Pele’s name came up. Probably because I played here, their ministry decided that their company should use me as their image. “And since I’m in the company, they want me to head anything that is connected to this project and the Makkasa team. Of course, it is a little bit of surprise for me. I have to think about it if it is beneficial to me economically and from the sporting perspective too. “If it is something that will give me bigger room, in case bigger opportunity comes tomorrow, I can leave. We‘re all learning. I am still with the club, the team and the company. This is the situation,” he added. Amuneke led El-Makkasa to two 1-1 draws against Smouha and Al Entag Al Harbi and a 1-0 loss to Tala’ea El Gaish in the Egyptian Cup, while in charge. The club have announced Ehab Galal as the new coach. Copyright PUNCH.
