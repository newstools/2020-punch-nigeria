The President, Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers, Dr Bola Onigbogi, has urged government to mitigate risks by taking insurance covers. In a statement, she described as unfortunate the recent fire disaster that occurred at Abule Ado in Lagos State, which led to loss of lives and destruction of property worth billions of naira. She said, “Insurance is a business setup for other businesses to thrive. A payment of little premium to insurance industry could have taken off the burden from the state government.” She added, “At a time like this, the heart of our council and the entire members go to those who lost their beloved families and valuables in the inferno.” According to her, the incident also provided an auspicious platform to underscore the pivotal place of insurance in risk mitigation and control, particularly through insurance. Onigbogi said in other climes, insurance normally provided succour to people in the event of adversity occasioned by loss of lives and property. “However, we are yet to embrace insurance and give it priority in our nation,” she said. She noted that it had often been the case that government would have to provide succour for victims of disasters, which actually should not have been if insurance was given its pride of place. The council canvassed that deliberate efforts should be made on the part of government to encourage the embrace of insurance by the generality of the people for its enormous benefits to national economy and social stabilisation. While applauding Lagos State Government for setting up a N2bn relief fund to address emergency needs in the Abule-Ado area, she said, “the humongous amounts often doled out as bailouts to victims of disasters could have been preserved and utilised by government for other pressing needs in the society.”
