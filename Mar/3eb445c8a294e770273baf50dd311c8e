James Abraham, Jos Two young men suspected to be thieves were on Friday burnt to death by a mob in Farin-Gada Community, Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau state. Our correspondent gathered that residents of the area woke up to the remains of the two victims at the ECWA Staff junction with parts of their bodies burnt. A tricycle rider in the community, Mr John David, told our City Round on Friday that the incident caused tension. David said, “I was at work in the morning when I saw some people gathering at the ECWA staff junction. On getting to the place, I saw two young men lying on the ground dead.  Parts of their heads and necks were burnt. When I enquired what happened, people said they were thieves. But nobody could tell what they stole or the people who set them ablaze.” Another resident, Chuwang Paul, said the incident was strange, adding that some policemen late came to remove the corpses. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, ASP Ubah Ogaba, said the police had begun investigation to unravel those behind the killings. He said, “They (victims) were suspected cultists and robbers that specialised in phone snatching. They were mobbed and killed. Police are on the matter to unravel those involved in the killings.” Copyright PUNCH.
