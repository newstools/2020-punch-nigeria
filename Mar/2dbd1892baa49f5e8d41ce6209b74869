Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna There was an attempted jailbreak by some prisoners at the Kaduna Correctional Centre on Tuesday. The PUNCH gathered that there was unrest among the prisoners when reports filtered into the facility located along the Independence Way in the metropolis over the possible spread of the coronavirus to the facility. The prisoners, it was learnt, feared that they might be affected by the deadly virus as a result of the congestion currently being experienced in the correctional facility. A resident close to the correctional facility said that he heard gunshots from the prison. Another source said some of the prisoners attempted to escape to avoid contracting the disease but were unsuccessful. One of the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told our correspondent on the telephone that, “We learnt the prison inmates are protesting. There is actually unrest there. They are protesting that they can be infected with the coronavirus.” The Public Relations Officer of the Kaduna Correctional Centre, Mr Nathaniel Gagas, confirmed the incident. “There is normalcy now. Security has beefed up in and outside the facility. There is no cause for alarm,” another source said. The PUNCH also gathered that the authorities of the correctional facility sought reinforcement from the Army, Police as well as the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps before the situation was brought under control. Meanwhile, the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, also known as “Shi’ites”, has warned that nothing must happen to their leader, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat, currently being held in the facility.
