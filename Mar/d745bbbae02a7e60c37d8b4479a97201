Ebenezer Bajela Former Super Falcons captain, Desire Oparanozie, has openly criticised the Nigerian government amidst fight to reduce the spread of coronavirus in the country as she labelled them incompetent, while urging Nigerians to remain at home. With many European countries struggling to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, Oparanozie expressed doubts over the country’s readiness to tackle the virus. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, all sporting activities have been suspended with attention turned to the fight to end the spread of the virus. As the number of confirmed cases continue to increase on a daily basis across the globe, the Guingamp striker pleaded with everyone to respect the stay at home rule. Oparanozie took to the social media to describe the Nigerian government selfish; whom she alleged will cater for the rich and influential before thinking of the masses. “I’ve been advising us to stay at home. Considering the kind of system we have (incompetent government),” Oparanozie wrote on her Twitter handle. “We can’t fight this virus if it hits hard on us. Obviously the rich and influential will be attended to before anyone else. Save yourselves people.” The 26-year-old has never been afraid to speak out as she led calls for equal pay in Nigerian football, citing disparity with the bonuses received by the team’s male counterparts in 2019.
