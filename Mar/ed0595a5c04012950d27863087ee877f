Solape Lawal-Solarin Victor Mosesâ€™ Serie A adventure with Inter may not go beyond this campaign according to reports in Italy. The former Super Eagles reunited with his former Chelsea boss, Antonio Conte, in January as he sought to revive his flailing career after undergoing dismal spell at Fenerbahce in Turkey. However, it seems everything has not gone as planned as his latest injury setback coupled, with his failure to hold down a starting berth at the right-back has forced the Nerazzurri to reconsider the option of signing him on a permanent basis at the end of the season. According to sempreinter.com, the San Siro Giants are unconvinced by the Nigerian and, will rather send him back to Chelsea at the end of the current campaign. Moses will enter the final twelve months of his contract with Chelsea in July 2020. The Nigerian has made five appearances in all competitions for the Nerazzurri so far. Copyright PUNCH.
