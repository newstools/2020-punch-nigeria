Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Tuesday, suspended the proposed ward, local government and state congresses of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ogun State, pending the hearing of an application. The presiding judge, Justice Inyang Ekwo, ordered that all parties in suit No: FHC/AB/CS/208/2020 should maintain status quo, pending the hearing of all applications in the suit. Two PDP factions exist in the state, one led by Sikirulahi Ogundele and Bayo Dayo, who were loyal to Oladipupo Adebutu and Buruji Kashamu, respectively. The National Working Committee of the PDP had filed an originating summon challenging the power of the Dayo-led executive to organise the 2020 state party congresses scheduled to start on March 7. The party also filed a motion on notice seeking for an injunction to stop the said congresses. After due consideration of the applications and documents filed by both the NWC of the PDP and Dayo-led executive, the presiding judge ordered that all parties should maintain status quo till the hearing of all applications on the adjourned date of April 2. The NWC of the PDP was represented by Chris Uche, SAN, Olumuyiwa Obanewa and Ehi Uwaifoh; R.A. Oluyede represented Adebayo Dayo; and Kingsley Magbuil represented the Independent National Electoral Commission. Copyright PUNCH.
