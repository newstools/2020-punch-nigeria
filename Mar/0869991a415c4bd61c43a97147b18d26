Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has  suspended the Permanent Secretary in the state Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Alhaji Mohammed Katsina, and two other top officials of the ministry for alleged extortion of money from farmers in the state. The governor in a statement signed by Rafiu Ajakaye, his Chief Press Secretary on Wednesday, directed the immediate suspension of the three officials who were named in the alleged extortion of money through the sale of unauthorised registration forms to farmers in the state. Abdulrazaq has also called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to wade into the matter. Ajakaye in the statement said, “The government at no time approved the sale of any forms to register farmers and that the administration found it strange that some officials could ever do such a thing to extort money from poor farmers. “In the light of the development, we wish to state that neither the governor nor the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development at any time approved the sale of forms to anyone, including farmers, in the guise of whatever scheme or census for farmers. “That preliminary in-house findings have been made and they suggested clear wrongdoings. That the Head of Service has accordingly been directed to suspend all the affected officials, including the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry. This is to send the signal that such misconduct will not be condoned by the governor,” he said. Copyright PUNCH.
