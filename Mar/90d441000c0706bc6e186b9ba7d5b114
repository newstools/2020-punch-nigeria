A civil society organisation, the Concerned Nigerians Movement, has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to direct security agencies to respect the fundamental human rights of the deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II. This was contained in a letter addressed to the retired major general on Tuesday and signed by the convener of the group, Deji Adeyanju. In the letter entitled, “Unlawful and unconstitutional arrest and detention of former Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi”, the group argued that Sanusi’s dethronement was unconstitutional, adding that his confinement was an infringement on his rights to liberty, peaceful assembly, and movement as enshrined in the constitution. The group said, “We are greatly concerned over his arbitrary arrest and detention as these negate all constitutional provisions on the right to liberty, peaceful assembly and freedom of movement. “The arrest and detention after dethronement carried out by the Kano State government are illegal and unconstitutional and many citizens are already insinuating that it has your consent and blessing as security agencies carried out the unlawful act.

We refer to the case of ‘Government of Kebbi State vs. HRH Mustapha Jokolo (2013)’ where the Court of Appeal condemned and declared that banishment and deportation of a king are unconstitutional. “We call on you to use your good office to immediately direct security agencies to respect his rights. The world will be keenly watching Nigeria on this.”
