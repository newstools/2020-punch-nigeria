John Charles, Makurdi The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Makurdi Zonal Office, on Thursday, arraigned one Musa Abubakar at the state High Court for an alleged N10m fraud. The defendant was arraigned on one count bordering on criminal breach of trust to the tune of N10,448,000.00. The EFCC said in the charge that Abubakar committed the offence between October 2018 and December 2018 in Makurdi. The anti-graft agency said he was entrusted with 4,500 bags of cement valued at N10.4m by one Abdulrahim Abubakar and he “did dishonestly misappropriate the said sum of N10,448,000 and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 312 of the Penal Code Laws of Benue State (CAP)124 (Revised Edition), 2004 and punishable under Section 313 of the same laws.” The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty. The prosecuting counsel for the EFCC, G. G. Chia-Yakua, requested a trial date, and asked the court to remand the defendant in a correctional centre. But the defence counsel, I. M. Mari, moved a bail application on behalf of his client. Justice M. A. Ikpambese granted bail to the defendant in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties in like sum. However, the defendant was remanded in the EFCC custody pending the perfection of his bail conditions. The case was adjourned till April 27, 2020 for trial to commence. Copyright PUNCH.
