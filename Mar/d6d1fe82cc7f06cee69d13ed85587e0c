Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Commissioner of Police, Osun State, Johnson Kokumo, has dismissed a viral report on social media that the corpse of a boy was exhumed from a church in the state. Several blogs had published the story, which was accompanied by a picture purportedly from the church located in the Oke Gbena area of Ikirun. The report also claimed that a Divisional Police Officer in the area, Hammed Sani, witnessed the exhumation of the corpse. But Kokumo told our correspondent in his office in Osogbo on Thursday that there was no DPO with that name in the Ikirun Area Command.

Kokumo stated, “There is no DPO in Ikirun, who bears the name, Sani. We have called the Area Commander and he told us that nothing like that happened in his area. “The story is not true. It is fake; please disregard it. We are in contact with the town mentioned in the report.” Copyright PUNCH.
