Anna Okon As a result of growing fears of a coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, Morocco has suspended all of its maritime connections with highly-infected Italy, according to The World Maritime News. After they announced early Tuesday the suspension of all flights to and from Italy to stop the spread of the virus, the directorate of the merchant navy at the Moroccan ministry of transport and logistics later made the announcement to also suspend maritime links with Italy. The decision is in line with the government’s directives to prevent the spread of COVID-19, said the directorate. The suspension concerns all boats traveling between Moroccan and Italian seaports. Lifting the suspension is dependent on the evolution of the epidemic in the European country, explained the institution. “The companies concerned must take the necessary measures to inform passengers and avoid their travel to the ports of departure,” recommends the directorate. Italy is currently the country with the second-highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, at over 10,100 cases and more than 630 reported deaths. On Monday, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte imposed a national quarantine on the entire country. He advised all Italians to stay at home except for necessities, work, and health circumstances. In Morocco, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases currently stands at five. Two of the patients contracted the virus in Italy, while three became infected in France. Copyright PUNCH.
