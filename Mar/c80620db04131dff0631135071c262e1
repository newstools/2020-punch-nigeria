The Edo State Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Erimona Edorodion Oye and the Minority Leader, Nigerian Youth Parliament, Daniel Uwadia, were among the 15-man delegation from Edo State who attended the World Urban Forum (WUF10) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) to chart paths to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda. The event in its 10th edition was organised by the United Nations Habitat, in partnership with the UAE government. In a statement, Uwadia said the five-day event, which held at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company, had the theme “Cities of opportunities: Connecting culture and innovation.” According to him, the programme focused on international and national legislation principles as it relates to the New Urban Agenda, the Agenda 2030 and issues bordering on the deforestation, climate activities and other hazardous effects of the rapid urbanisation in areas like Lagos, Benin and Port-Harcourt. “The parliamentary roundtable allowed the opportunity to network with top officials and parliamentarians from various countries and meet key stakeholders in the UN. Various cities/countries were represented at the exhibition grounds where they showcased the direction their governments are taking in advancing cultural and innovative urbanisation.” Copyright PUNCH.
