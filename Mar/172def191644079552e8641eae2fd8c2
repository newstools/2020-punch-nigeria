Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Two persons were feared killed on Wednesday following an alleged invasion of the Ezetu community in the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa State by soldiers. It was gathered that the two victims were killed by stray bullets during the onslaught by the soldiers. The soldiers were said to have stormed the area based on intelligence that some suspects, who attacked and burnt a houseboat at Azagbene in the Ekeremor Local Government Area of the state, were hiding in Ezetu. The soldiers were said to have acted based on a tip-off with a view to fishing out the suspects. Community sources said the ensuing shootout resulted in the death of the two persons at the Eddy Camp located between Ezetu and Ekeni communities. It was also learnt that some residents were injured in the incident, while others were taken away by the soldiers.
