James Abraham Two soldiers have allegedly been killed by gunmen in Miango community, Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State. Eyewitnesses said on Saturday that the two deceased soldiers were on patrol of the community along Ancha Road when the gunmen attacked them. A villager, Mr Yohanna Gado, said the victims died on the spot while their rifles were carted away by the gunmen during the ambush which occurred on Friday evening. Gado said, “We heard gunshots around 6:15pm which lasted until around 7:45pm. When the sound of the gunshots ceased, we came out only to discover the body of two soldiers lying dead on the ground. Their rifles have been taken away. “The soldiers were from our community, I don’t know their names but they were friendly and loved our people. They always patrolled the village on their motorbikes and they normally gave us tips on security. “The community feels too bad about the loss of the soldiers who came to serve their fatherland.” Spokesman for Miango Youth Development Association, Mr Lawrence Zongo, said the corpses of the slain soldiers had been evacuated to the mortuary. He said, “When the incident happened, some soldiers came and took away the two corpses. The situation was unfortunate. I followed them to the scene of the incident. Those who perpetrated the act must not go unpunished.” Spokesman for the State Police Command, ASP Ubah Ogaba, when contacted, referred our correspondent to the Media Officer of the Special Task Force in the state (otherwise known as Operation Safe Haven), Major Ibrahim Shitu, for comment on the incident. However, several calls put across to his mobile were not responded to as of press time. Copyright PUNCH.
