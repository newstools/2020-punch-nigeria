Turkish Super Lig club Trabzonspor have terminated their contract with Nigeria’s John Obi Mikel. Following the termination which was through mutual consent, Mikel will not be paid any compensation as he agreed to give up all forward-looking rights and receivables. The midfielder’s contract would have run until 2021 had he stayed on at Trabzonspor. “The professional football player agreement between our company and John Obi Mikel on 30.06.2019 start date 31.05.2021 has been mutually terminated. “With a mutual termination agreement, the football player gave up all his forward-looking receivables,” the club announced on its website. The 32-year-old, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2012, was a free agent after leaving Championship side Middlesbrough in May. He joined the Trabzonspor on a two-year deal with the option of an additional 12 months in June 2019. Mikel played for Nigeria at the last Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, and previously played in Norway and China. The midfielder made 249 Premier League appearances for Chelsea in an 11-year spell. He also won two league titles, three FA Cups and the Europa League in 2013. Mikel featured in two World Cups for Nigeria and helped the Super Eagles win the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. He was also one of Nigeria’s three over-age players as the African side won a bronze medal at the 2016 Olympics in Rio.
