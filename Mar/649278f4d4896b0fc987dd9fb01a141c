Kelvin Ekerete Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has described former La Masia teammate, Haruna Babangida, as the best player in the world. Both players featured for Barcelona academy La Masia, with the Nigerian being one of the most prolific players’ to feature for the Barca B team, scoring 42 goals in 110 appearances but never made it to the senior team, before making a switch to Ukrainian side Metalurh Donetsk in 2004. Both Babangida and Arteta failed to make it to Barca’s first team, but while the Nigerian didn’t live up to his talent, Arteta went on to make his mark for PSG, Rangers, Everton and Arsenal. In an interview with The Athletic, Arteta noted that despite the qualities of players in the team, Babangida was the best in the world at the time. “In our dorms at Barcelona, we had Pepe Reina, Victor Valdes, Andres Iniesta and Carles Puyol. But I remember there was this boy called Haruna Babangida. Wow! at 15, he was the best player in the world.” Babangida joined an endless list of wonder kids who were destined for greatness but never achieved it. The 37-year-old made his debut, his only game for Nigeria, on August 20, 2003, in a friendly match which Nigeria lost 3-0 to Japan in Tokyo. Copyright PUNCH.
