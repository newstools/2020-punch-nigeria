Against the backdrop of the raging novel coronavirus, the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency has barred international vessels without thermal facilities from calling at Nigerian ports. A thermal screening is a process of detecting radiation. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature; therefore, thermography allows one to see variations in temperature. If someone has a fever, thermal screening will detect them and they can further be tested for coronavirus. The Director-General, NIMASA, Dr Bashir Jamoh, who unveiled the directive along with other guidelines for vessels visiting Nigeria, said the measures were needed to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially through shipping activities. A statement signed by the Head, Corporate Affairs, NIMASA, Mr Isichei Osamgbi, quoted him as saying, “These are trying times and we must pull through together.” He directed that the vessels must have screening facilities for passengers and crew before they could be allowed into the ports.
