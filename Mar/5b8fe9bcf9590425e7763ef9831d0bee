Samuel Awoyinfa Vitafoam Nigeria Plc posted an after-tax profit of N1.57bn in 2019 as against N486.12m in the preceding year, an increase of 224 per cent. The manufacturing company also declared a cumulative dividend of N525.35m, an increase of 102 per cent over N260.52m in 2018, which translated to 42 kobo per share. The Chairman, Vitafoam, Dr Bamidele Makanjuola, said, “Our outstanding performance is not just because we utilised the loans we took from the Bank of Industry and other banks to create value for shareholders but ingenuity of the company’s leadership. “Vitafoam is blessed with level headed, innovative and passionate youths that form the core of our managers. The board also comprises wise elders who are always willing to assist the management.” Makanjuola, who spoke at the company’s annual general meeting in Lagos, said, “The remarkable improvement in performance reflected the effectiveness of improved funding efficiency gains, and impact of the strategic initiatives implemented to address the protracted challenge of low margins in the business. “The company leveraged the Bank of Industry’s long-term loan facility and other flexible financing windows by negotiating better trade terms with foreign suppliers of raw materials, thereby sidestepping the middle men. The resulting reduction in the cost price of raw materials impacted positively on gross margin.” Shareholders commended the company’s board and management for the performance, stressing the need to strengthen the subsidiaries in order to expand the company’s revenue base.
