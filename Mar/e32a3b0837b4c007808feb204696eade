Solape Lawal-Solarin Odion Ighalo and his Manchester United teammates are being tested twice a day for coronavirus during training, according to reports. Club doctors at Manchester United’s Carrington training ground are unwilling to take any risks with the virus continuing to spread the Mirror claims. As a result, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men are tested when they arrive and leave the training ground. However, United are taking precautions, with only essential first-team staff allowed to come into close contact with players. The news comes after it was revealed that United’s players were monitored for the virus throughout their Europa League last 16 first leg against LASK. They took player’s temperatures at the halfway stage to make certain no-one was at risk of falling victim to the coronavirus. Meanwhile, Ighalo, who is already enjoying life at Old Trafford is willing to take a massive pay-cut to join Manchester United permanently. The 30-year-old has scored four goals in eight appearances for the Red Devils since he arrived on a six-month loan from Shanghai Shenhua in January.
