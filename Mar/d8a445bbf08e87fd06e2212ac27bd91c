Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has resolved to intervene in the crisis between the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities over the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System. The leadership of the House has scheduled a meeting with the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu; Minister of Labour, Employment and Productivity, Chris Ngige; and President of ASUU, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi, on Wednesday (today). The Federal Government had made enrolment on the IPPIS platform compulsory for all its workers, which ASUU had opposed. At the plenary on Tuesday, a member of the House, Mr Dachung Bagos, had moved a motion of urgent public importance on the matter. While moving the motion, Bagos said, “The House notes that ASUU has on the 9th of March, 2020, after its National Executive Council meeting held in Enugu resolved to go on a two-week warning strike. “The House is aware that schools have just resumed for exercise. The House is concerned that the strike if allowed to take full effect, it will cost a lot of students extra academic year.” Adopting the motion, the House resolved that the leadership should meet with the ministries of Labour, Employment and Productivity; and Education as well as ASUU on the crisis. The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, later asked the Clerk to the House, Patrick Giwa, to write the ministers and ASUU president, inviting them to a meeting at 9am on Wednesday. Copyright PUNCH.
