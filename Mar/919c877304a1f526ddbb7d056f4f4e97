Wale Oyewale, Ibadan Family members, friends and associates of former representative, Akinyele/Lagelu federal constituency in the National Assembly, late Temitope Olatoye aka Sugar, have demanded the outcome of the investigation into the killing of the late politician. They said one year was enough to unfold circumstances surrounding his death. They also urged the Oyo State Government to honour the late lawmaker by approving scholarships for his children and by naming a monument after him. Olatoye, who was Chairman, Urban Development and Regional Planning, House of Representatives, was gruesomely murdered by unknown assailants on March 9, 2019, during the governorship election in Oyo State. Speaking during the one year anniversary of his demise, his close associates lamented what they described as slow pace of investigation into his death. Special Adviser to former Oyo State governor, Abiola Ajimobi, on Disability Matters, Prince Paul Adelabu, said, “Those who instigated the death of Olatoye Sugar should have been apprehended by now but we can’t say what is responsible for the delay. We are now saying that we want to know his killers. In the same vein, within 48 hours, Governor Seyi Makinde should honour this great man for his contributions to humanity.” Speaking on the occasion, the Chairman,  Oyo State Road Management Agency, Kamil Akinlabi, said, the state government was still gathering information about the members of the immediate family of the deceased, adding that his passage was painful and that the family that he left behind would not be isolated.
