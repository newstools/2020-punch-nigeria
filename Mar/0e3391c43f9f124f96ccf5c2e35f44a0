Sunday PUNCH learnt that the three-storey building collapsed around 7pm and trapped the labourer whose identity had yet to be ascertained. Some of his co-workers were also said to have sustained minor injuries but were treated at the spot by paramedics and discharged. The General Manager, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, said preliminary investigation revealed that the concrete canopy above door level on the ground floor of the one-story building collapsed due to structural defect. He said the debris fell on the labourer who was immersed in the renovation at the time. He stated, “We activated our emergency response plan and moved to the scene.
