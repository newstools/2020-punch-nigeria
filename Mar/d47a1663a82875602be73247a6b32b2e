Ebenezer Bajela Italian giant, AC Milan, has joined in the race for the signing of red hot Super Eagles forward, Victor Osimhen, following his impressive performance for Lille this season. AC Milan will rival Manchester United and Real Madrid for the signature of the Nigeria international, as both clubs had been linked with the player in the past. Football Espana had earlier reported that the Spanish giants were ready to table an offer in the region of €40m for the 21-year-old striker, an offer way below the asking price of the French side. However, an Italian website, Calciomercato, believed that the good relations between the French club and the Italian could play a major role in the signing of Osimhen but admitted that it might not be easy given the interest from Manchester United and Madrid. “The Nigerian striker has also been linked to Milan in the last period given the good relations with the French club,” the website wrote. “But bringing the Lagos striker into Serie  A will not be easy at all, the footballer – as reported by the ‘Daily Star’ in England – has ended up in the sights of two top clubs, Real Madrid and Manchester United, who are ready to put important money on the plate to snatch him from the competition.” Osimhen has been one of the standout performers for Lille in the French League this season. The former Wolfsburg player, who joined Lille from Belgian club, Sporting Charleroi, last summer has scored 13 goals and recorded five assists in 27 league appearances for Les Dogues.
