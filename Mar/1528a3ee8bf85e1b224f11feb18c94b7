Maiharaji Altine, Gusau Some bandits suspected to be Fulani have killed popular twin brothers, Hassan and Husaini, in Birnin Tsaba village, in the Birnin Magaji Local Government Area of Zamfara State. The people of the town thereafter killed three Fulani people. An eyewitness, Mohammed Sani, said the problem started when a group of bandits went to Birnin Magaji market and shot Hassan and Husaini dead. He said,  “Immediately the bandits killed  the twin brothers, they left the market on their motorcycles.” He added that when the people of the community got the information about the killing of the twin brothers by Fulani bandits, they mobilised and went in search of any Fulani man. “As a result of this, three Fulani people have been killed by the angry mob, while others escaped with serious injuries,” Sani added. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Mohammed Shehu, said effort was  ongoing in order to arrest “the perpetrators of this dastardly act.” Copyright PUNCH.
