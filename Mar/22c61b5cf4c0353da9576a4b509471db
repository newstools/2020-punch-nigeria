Solape Lawal-Solarin Bukayo Saka’s contract impasse will definitely be resolved, assures manager Mikel Arteta. The teen sensation has been embroiled in what seems to be a standoff as his representatives and club directors remain distant from agreeing on a new deal. The England youth international of Nigerian descent is already in the final 18 months of his contract and looks likely to walk out on the Gunners if a new deal can’t be reached, with Manchester United and Liverpool waiting to swoop on him. However, Arteta believes Saka’s future remains at the Emirates and is confident that the club can tie the teenager to a new deal. “The club is doing what it has to do and is having conversations, (and hopefully) we’ll get it resolved,” he told the club’s website. Saka has played in 18 Premier League games (12 starts) and managed three assists. He is a winger, but has played many games at full-back given Arsenal’s injuries in those positions. Copyright PUNCH.
