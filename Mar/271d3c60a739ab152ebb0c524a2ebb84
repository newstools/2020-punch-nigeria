Samuel Awoyinfa The Senate Committee on Industries says it will ensure the return of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria to the nation’s seaports. The Chairman of the committee, Senator Bayo Osinowo, said this on Friday, during the committee’s visit to the Ogba, Lagos laboratory complex of the organisation as part of its oversight functions. On October 10, 2011, President Goodluck Jonathan had approved the sacking of 10 government agencies, including SON from the country’s seaports. However, the committee had said it was unfortunate that SON was not at the ports, adding that “the law establishing SON states that the standards body must be present at the ports to monitor the standards of products being produced and imported into the country.” The Director-General, SON, Osita Aboloma, said the oversight visit was to give the committee firsthand information about the level of progress made so far by the agency in the wake of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement. He said the committee had seen what it had achieved with the funds appropriated to it. Copyright PUNCH.
