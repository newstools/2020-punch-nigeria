Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The All Progressives Congress in Ekiti State on Thursday rejected the nomination of a former Oyo State Governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, by the party’s National Working Committee as the deputy national chairman (South) of the party. The state APC Publicity Secretary, Ade Ajayi, who insisted that the nominee for the position from Ekiti State remained Senator Gbenga Aluko, said the nomination by the NWC did not follow due process. Ajayi in a statement in Ado Ekiti argued that the nomination was also in contempt of court as the matter was before a law court. The position became vacant following the exit of the former occupant, Niyi Adebayo, from Ekiti State to become a minister. Ajayi said, “The position of the Deputy National Chairman South of the APC is still vacant and whatever nomination and announcement that may have been made is a nullity and an exercise in futility. “We wish to state that the announcement is a fraudulent assertion. We recall that select leaders of the APC in the South-West met  in Lagos on January 31, 2020 where the APC state chairmen and other members of the South-West caucus, being the statutory organ, was mandated to meet and decide on  the matter.

It can only be a fraud! “As far as the Ekiti State APC is concerned, our nominee for the vacant position of the Deputy Vice- Chairman, (South), is Senator Aluko.” Copyright PUNCH.
