The Kwara Sector Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps has confirmed that nine persons lost their lives in a crash that occurred along Bode Saadu–Jebba road on Tuesday. The Sector Commander, Mr Jonathan Owoade, told the News Agency of Nigeria that the crash was a result of speeding. “It is another sad incident occurring on the Bode Saadu-Jebba road axis; it was a fatal accident involving just one commercial vehicle, a Mitsubishi Canter truck with registration number DRK327YX. “14 persons were involved, sadly nine lost their lives while five other persons sustained various degrees of injury,” he said. The sector commander stressed that travellers going through the Bode Saadu-Jebba Road should be aware that the road has ascending and descending bends. “Articulated vehicles and other vehicles used in carrying goods should be very careful on that road axis. “Most of the time, it is the goods they carry that kill them, because it can fall on them. That is why I want to advise that they speed less, take caution and also ensure proper vehicle maintenance,” Owoade said.
