Anna Okon Maritime workers have threatened to declare emergency in the sector if shipping lines refuse to heed their demands for better working conditions. Recall that the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria had earlier issued a 21-day ultimatum to the Shipping Association of Nigeria to convene a meeting of its members and representatives of the union with a view to resolving the conflicts surrounding working conditions in the industry. In a statement made available to our correspondent on Monday, the union said it had exhausted all legal and other means to get the meeting to take place without success. In the statement signed by MWUN’s Deputy Secretary General, Organising, Abudu Eroje, the union accused shipping lines of perpetually keeping its members in penury and pain. It also accused shipping lines of “forming themselves into lodges above and impervious to our national laws, breaching every rule of industrial relations, thus engendering a failure in our social partnership.” Copyright PUNCH.
