Gibson Achonu, Owerri The South-East wing of the Peoples Democratic Party has nullified the expulsion of Senator Samuel Anyanwu, who represented the Imo East (Owerri) senatorial district between 2015 and 2019. The nullification came up on Tuesday after the South-East zonal meeting of the PDP governors, senators and  House of Representatives members among other top members of the party. In a short statement, the party said no due process was followed in the expulsion of the senator. Recall that Anyanwu was on Thursday last week expelled from the party by the Imo State chapter of the party. But the South-East zone of the party noted that as a national officer and member of the national executive committee of the PDP, the state chapter could  not expel Anyanwu. “No member of the party should be expelled from the party no matter the season so that the party can excel in the forthcoming election in 2023,” the statement read. A committee was also set up to look into political cases in Imo and Anambra states with a view to reporting to the National Executive Council of the party before any drastic action was taken by the state chapters of the party.
