Tobi Aworinde, Abuja The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has said the restrictive measures by the Federal Government to curb the spread of coronavirus is a matter of life and death. There have been 97 confirmed cases and one death in the country since the index case on February 27. Buhari, who spoke during a live presidential address on Sunday evening, announced a restriction of movement for a period of 14 days in Lagos State, Ogun State and the Federal Capital Territory. The President added, “We are fully aware that such measures will cause much hardship and inconvenience to many citizens. But this is a matter of life and death, if we look at the dreadful daily toll of deaths in Italy, France and Spain. “However, we must all see this as our national and patriotic duty to control and contain the spread of this virus. I will, therefore, ask all of us affected by this order to put aside our personal comfort to safeguard ourselves and fellow human beings. “This common enemy can only be controlled if we all come together and obey scientific and medical advice. As we remain ready to enforce these measures, we should see this as our individual contribution in the war against COVID-19.” Buhari stated that for residents of satellite and commuter towns and communities around Lagos and Abuja whose livelihoods would be affected by some of the restrictive measures, “we shall deploy relief materials to ease their pains in the coming weeks.”
