Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has handed   over  stolen  N263m  recovered from  corrupt politicians and civil servants  to  Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara State. Handing over  the money  to Abdulrazaq at the Ilorin zonal office of the EFCC on Tuesday,  the leader  of the office, Isyaku Sharu,  said  the money  was part of the looted funds recovered from  corrupt officers in the state. Sharu said, “I have the mandate of the acting chairman of the EFCC to hand over N263,327,800  in cash recovered from suspected Kwara State treasury looters. “These alleged looters siphoned the money  from  the Kwara Internal Revenue Service and the 16 local government areas in the state. “About N5bn was allegedly siphoned from  the KWIRS and shared in the ratio of 30 to 70 per cent by some notable individuals in the state through their cronies.” The governor, who commended the EFCC for recovering the stolen money,  said the state government  would put  the money  into  its   social investment programme  to  take off soon. Abdulrazaq said the bill for the establishment of the social investment programme  had been sent to the  House of  Assembly. The  anti-graft agency  in October last year returned  N111m  stolen  public money to the state government. Copyright PUNCH.
