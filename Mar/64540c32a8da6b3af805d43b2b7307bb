The Italian had recently been discharged. Following the increasing cases of the virus, Nigeria’s President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), ordered a shutdown of Lagos, Abuja and Ogun State. On Day One of the shutdown, Lagos was calm with the usual traffic jams disappearing. Like in Lagos, markets, schools and clubs among others were also shut in Abuja. Meanwhile, the NCDC says it is set to increase its capacity to test for COVID-19 to 1,500 per day in the country.
