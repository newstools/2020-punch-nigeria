Dele Ogunyemi, Warri The Delta State Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu, has said the distribution of palliatives to cushion the effects of the lockdown against Covid-19 in the state would commence by weekend. Aniagwu said this in a phone chat on Thursday in Warri on Thursday. The commissioner, who regretted the lockdown that had sparked protests in parts of the state, said the aim was to contain the spread of the pandemic. “We recognise the pains our people are going through in this trying time. We will start the distribution of palliatives to the grass roots by weekend to cushion the effects. “Government is interested in saving lives. The lives of the people are more important than the economy. People should support the government in this trying moment. The extension of the lockdown is for the interest of the people,” he said.
