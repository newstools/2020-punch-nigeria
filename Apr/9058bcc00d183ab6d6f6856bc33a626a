Dayo Ojerinde The Joint Health Sector Unions has urged the Federal Government to treat all health workers equally. In a memo to the Federal Government on permanent payment mechanism of hazard allowance to health workers in Nigeria,  obtained by our correspondent, the JOHESU National Chairman, Comrade Biobelemoye Josiah, said the union had a contrary view to the Nigerian Medical Association’s position on the health workers to benefit from COVID-19 hazard allowances. “On April 21, 2020, the Federal Government facilitated a temporary MoU with some health sector professional bodies based on a proposal tabled by the NMA which brought in some of its affiliate professional associations. “Contrary to the NMA position, JOHESU reject a selective list of Health workers as beneficiaries of the COVID-19 hazard allowances by positing that the entire value chain of health workers including non-clinical staff must be beneficiaries of hazard allowances. “The NMA has tied payment of hazard allowances to basic salary. Doctors’ basic salaries are relatively higher than anyone else’s, but hazard is not supposed to be tied to how much you earn! The peculiar job, atmosphere and length of exposure should be the determinant factors, not salary level. “Each cadre of health care worker has peculiar risks. In the same cadre, the seniors may be less exposed, but they get higher pay if this method is used. The junior doctors are much more exposed to environmental hazards than the senior ones, but are paid less,” Josiah said. He, therefore, advocated an equal pay per hour, equal life insurance and equal appreciation in all ways for all health workers to ensure industrial harmony. Copyright PUNCH.
