Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Residents of Ile Ife, Osun State, on Thursday were further restricted to only their homes, as Oro procession went through some major streets for spiritual cleansing against COVID-19. A 14-day restriction to prevent spread of coronavirus, starting from Wednesday, had commenced across the state. However, sources in Ife told our correspondent that there was public service announcement aired by a radio station based in the town, signed by one Chief Oyelami Awoyode on behalf of Ooni, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, intimating residents that Oro procession would move through some major streets on Thursday. The announcement was also accompanied by a stern warning that whoever was caught would pay dearly for it. Also, town criers were said to have gone round the town to announce restriction of movement between 6am and 6pm on Thursday. Also, in the said announcement, many neighbourhoods in the ancient city where the procession would reach were listed. Residents of Oja titun, Moore, Iyekere, Okerewe and Omisore areas, who spoke to The PUNCH on Thursday afternoon, said they were indoors in order not to get caught by Oro. Tayo Aderibigbe, a resident of Oja titun in a chat, said, “The Oro procession has not reached my neighbourhood but all of us are indoors. The street is deserted. “It is not strange to us. Occasionally, residents would be asked to stay indoors for exercises like this.” Meanwhile, Osun State Government has said whenever it would start distribution of relief items to cushion effects of 14 days restriction, the sick and vulnerable would be given priority consideration.Copyright PUNCH.
