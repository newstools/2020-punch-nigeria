Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Monday said it was in talks with the Rivers State Government for the release of Caverton Helicopters pilots who were detained in the state last week. Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, had announced on Friday that the pilots would be released soon without conviction. Rivers State Government arrested and detained the pilots for allegedly flouting its directive by flying into the Air Force Base in Port Harcourt despite a lockdown order. Speaking at the daily briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Aviation, Hassan Musa, said it was important to fasttrack the release of the pilots. He stated that this was based on threats by various unions in the aviation sector to embark on industrial action across airports. Musa said, “The Federal Government is in consultation with the Rivers State Government to have them released as soon as possible. “This is because their arrest is taking a different dimension as air traffic union and other unions in the aviation sector are threatening to go on strike. “We hope that this misunderstanding will soon be resolved so that we can have them out as their operation was legal.” Sirika had insisted on Friday that officers who arrested the pilots were ignorant and incompetent, as the pilots were carrying out their lawful duties.
