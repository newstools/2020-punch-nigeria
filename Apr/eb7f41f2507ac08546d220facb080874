Toni Ufoh Former Paris Saint Germain manager, Philippe Bergeroo, has voiced his admiration for retired Nigerian midfielder Austin Okocha. Okocha, a former Super Eagles captain, played for the Les Parisiens between 1998 and 2002. Michel Platini, who Bargeroo likened Okocha’s style of play to, is a legend in France and European football, where he made a name for himself with Nancy, Saint-Etienne and Juventus. Bergeroo told planetepsg.com in an interview that the former Eintracht Frankfurt star had skills that many footballers of his generation lacked. Bergeroo said, “He (Okocha) was a good guy, the joy of living embodied, someone who had exceptional peripheral vision, a bit like Platini. He continued, “He knew where all the players were. In taking visual information, it was exceptional. In the end, our relationships deteriorated. But I’m glad I had a player like that.” Copyright PUNCH.
