Wale Oyewale There was pandemonium at Monatan area of Ibadan, Oyo State, on Saturday as a newly established online radio station, Agidigbo Radio, reportedly went up in flames. The radio station, located at Suite 27/28, Mojoyinola, Opposite Akinwale, Elena Bus Stop, was said to have been under lock and key as of the time of the incident. The Director, Oyo State Fire Service, Moshood Adewuyi, who confirmed the incident to Saturday PUNCH, said the fire station was alerted around 11am. He said firemen were mobilised to the scene following a distress call by residents of the community in the early hours of Saturday. Adewuyi said, “It is true that the studio of the radio station caught fire this morning; the place was under lock and key on the arrival of our men. None of the workers of the radio station was around at the time of the outbreak.” He said a transmitter, studio equipment and some office materials at the station were damaged by the inferno. “One man was electrocuted. But, thank God, it was not much. What happened was that as soon as our men arrived at the scene, we directed our control room to instruct the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company to cut power supply to the area. “Without getting supply from us, they restored power supply to the area. The majority of the people were already wet, and you know, water is a conductor of electricity. No life was lost,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
