A mother died of coronavirus just days after giving birth to her third child. Salina Shaw, 37, gave birth to her third daughter on April 7 but died on April 12 after testing positive for the virus, reports DailyMail. She lived a ‘healthy vegan lifestyle’ but did have diabetes, her partner Abdul Bangura said. The childminder and business owner from Southend, Essex, had posted about her concerns over COVID-19 on social media in the weeks before her death. Uploading a copy of her baby scan to Facebook on March 18, she wrote, “Feeling anxious bringing a child into this mess at the moment.” On March 21, the mother-of-three posted a picture of herself claiming she had gone out to buy supplies, but ended up in the park when she saw people failing to observe social distancing. She wrote, “Went to Savers saw the queue ended up in the park. Social distancing.”
