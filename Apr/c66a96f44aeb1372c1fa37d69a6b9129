Nike Popoola Rosabon Financial Services, a non-bank financial services provider, says it is providing collateral-free and guarantor-free loans as low as N40,000  and up to N3m to cater to civil servants to curb effect of coronavirus crisis. The firm said in a statement that this was part of a series of measures being implemented by the company to cater to civil servants who were currently affected by the lockdown, and had their payroll handled by the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System. Speaking about the public sector loan package, the Managing Director, Rosabon Financial Services, Mr Chukwuma Ochonogor, said, “Rosabon is indeed proud to provide solutions for our customers in their time of need. “There is no gainsaying the fact that the lockdown has placed many civil servants in a huge financial predicament. While loans and other credits are usually hard to get hold of, obtaining a loan for many public sector workers may be more difficult during this lockdown period.” He noted that the Federal Government had mandated civil servants’ salaries to be paid to mitigate the impact of the lockdown. However, he said many states had still not paid salaries. Copyright PUNCH.
