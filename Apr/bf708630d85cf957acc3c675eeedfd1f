The youth had alleged that the oil company had not respected the agreements it reached with the community. They claimed that the oil firm had destroyed the roads in the community with its operations without repairing them. An indigene of the community, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity said, “The youth blocked the operational vehicle belonging to the company, insisting that they won’t free it until the firm repaired the roads. “The oil company called soldiers, who came to the scene and scared everybody with gunshots.” A journalist, Don Uba, who was in the community when the soldiers were shooting, said most of the villagers ran into the bush. He told our correspondent that he was speaking from a nearby bush that he ran into. When contacted, the police spokesperson in the state, Orlando Ikeokwu, told our correspondent that the disagreement had been settled.
