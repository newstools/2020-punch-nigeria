Kayode Oyero The Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi Araba, has said 37 resident doctors were yet to receive their salaries because they were yet to register on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information platform of the Federal Government. The hospital’s Director of Administration, Dr Babajide Grillo, made this known in a statement on Tuesday. According to him, the hospital admitted 200 new resident doctors in August 2019 and while 136 of the doctors resumed duty immediately, the others deferred their resumption by two to four months. He explained that the first batch completed all necessary formalities including registration on IPPIS, however, the second batch, who deferred their resumption, missed the initial capturing by the IPPIS team invited from Abuja. He said another arrangement for the IPPIS team to capture the second batch of doctors was made but the coronavirus pandemic stalled the plan.

However, it should be noted that their late resumption was the primary cause. “We, therefore, appeal for patience till the lockdown is over and travels resume to enable the completion of the very process their group had delayed.”
