Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja The Office of the Accountant General of the Federation on Thursday night said it had successfully restored service on the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System platform. GIFMIS is an information technology-based system for budget management and accounting that is meant to improve public expenditure management processes. It also helps to enhance greater accountability and transparency across ministries and agencies of government. The OAGF in a statement said the shut down of the GIFMIS platform was caused by the fire outbreak at the Treasury House on Wednesday. The fire had affected the outdoor panels of the cooling system of the server, and as a result, the server  automatically shut itself down. The statement said repair work was  immediately carried out on the affected equipment and at 12.30pm on Thursday, the server was successfully restarted. The statement said service had been restored and payments could be made and received through the GIFMIS platform. The Treasury House which is the headquarters of the OAGF was engulfed by fire on Wednesday which started at about 10am from the fourth floor of the six-storey edifice. Copyright PUNCH.
