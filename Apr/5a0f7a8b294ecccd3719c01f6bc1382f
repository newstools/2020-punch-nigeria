John Alechenu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has vowed that the regime led by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), would tame “the emerging opportunistic crimes” being recorded in parts of the country as a result of the COVID-19 induced lockdown. In a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in Abuja, on Wednesday, the APC said criminal activities such as robberies and looting as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown “will soon be brought under check.” The statement read in part, “The key responsibility of government remains ensuring the safety and security of lives and property of all citizens. “From the renewed and intensified Boko Haram counter-insurgency to the enhanced offensive against emerging crimes in other parts of the country, the government would continue to take bold steps to secure the country and the citizenry. “In line with the directives of President Muhammadu Buhari during his broadcast on Monday, a major and coordinated offensive by the Police, Army, Navy, Airforce, and Directorate of State Services (DSS) is underway against the miscreants.” The party admitted that Nigerians were passing through hardships as a result of the unavoidable lockdown. It, however, said, “We must resist criminal elements trying to exploit the situation and in the process inflicting further hardships on already stressed fellow Nigerians.” The party also cautioned various vigilante groups across the nation to resist the urge to resort to unlawful and extra-judicial actions in the name of protecting communities. Government and private concerns it said were doing their best to provide relief, as such Nigerians all have a responsibility to join the security services in protecting ourselves and communities from miscreants.
