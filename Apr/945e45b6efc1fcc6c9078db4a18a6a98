Anna Okon Nigerian businessman and the Managing Director of Port Harcourt-based Valec Electric Limited, Mr Okwudili Ogbuenyi, has blamed the low productivity among many young people in Nigeria on a growing culture of entitlement inherited from years of hearing political leaders call them the leaders of tomorrow. Ogbuenyi who advised the youths to invest their energy in talent development and entrepreneurship, also insisted that they owed the society the debt of deploying their young creative energy in contributing to the advancement of their environment. He was speaking while being conferred with the award of Nigerian Youth Ambassador by the National Youth Council of Nigeria in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. A statement from the organisers said the award was in recognition of Ogbuenyi’s inventions in the area of electrical and electronics engineering as well as his works of philanthropy. Speaking further, Ogbuenyi regretted the impact of political slogans on youth empowerment and said the time had come for young people to take practical steps towards empowering themselves through knowledge-based self-improvement. He said, “We have been hearing about youths being the leaders of tomorrow since we were children. But my analyses show that even those who were youths at the time this insincere political rhetoric began have grown into adults without a change of guard.” Copyright PUNCH.
