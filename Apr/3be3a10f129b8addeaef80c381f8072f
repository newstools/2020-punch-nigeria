Nike Popoola The Lagos State has commended Ecobank Nigeria for donating food items to support the state government’s relief efforts to mitigate the effects of the lockdown on citizens due to coronavirus pandemic. A statement said Lagos State Commissioner for Agriculture, Prince Gbolahan Lawal, who received the items and spoke on behalf of the state Governor, Babajide Sanwo- Olu, said Ecobank had always been a good corporate citizen of the state. He assured that the items would be deployed for the purpose they were meant for. Lawal stated, “I want to place on record that as a government, we are pleased with Ecobank, the pan African bank for identifying with the good people of Lagos State at this moment of need. “We will ensure the distribution is transparent and the items get to the indigent people who are vulnerable and therefore most affected by the lockdown. “I enjoin Lagosians to continue in their cooperation with the state government’s several initiatives at checking the spread of the  pandemic such as the lockdown and social distancing campaign. There is light at the end of the tunnel.” The statement said the Managing Director, Ecobank Nigeria, Patrick Akinwuntan, who was represented by Head, Agribusiness, Moji Oguntoyinbo, said the donation was part of the bank’s corporate social responsibility initiatives to support those in need within the environment where the bank did business. He said the bank was making similar donation to other states across the country. Copyright PUNCH.
