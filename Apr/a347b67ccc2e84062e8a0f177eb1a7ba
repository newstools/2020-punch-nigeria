Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri Chairmen of the All Progressives Congress in all the states and the Federal Capital Territory on Friday said they never asked to be involved in the appointment of a new Chief of Staff to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd). The denial followed media reports that the chairmen had recommended that the party’s national leadership be involved in the choice of a new chief of staff for Buhari, following the death of Abba Kyari, who died of COVID-19 last week. The Chairman of the APC Forum of State Chairmen, Ali Dalori, who is also the APC chairman in Borno State, in the statement issued in Maiduguri, said, “Our message to the President was purely to convey our thoughts and prayers to him over the loss of his chief of staff and friend of over 40 years. In reporting the condolence message, however, it was erroneously suggested that we recommended the APC national leadership to choose the late Abba Kyari’s successor for the President. “While it is totally outside our mandate to be involved on issue of the President’s chief of staff, associating us with such matter at a time the President and the country was at the peak of bereavement, tended to present the forum of the APC chairmen as being highly insensitive to the mood of the President, our party and the country.” Copyright PUNCH.
