MATTHEW OCHEI An Anglican priest, Revd Anthony Oyi, has been kidnapped by suspected Fulani herders on his farm at Issele-Mkpitime, Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State. Sunday PUNCH gathered that the priest, who hails from Issele-Mkpitime, had gone with his family to the farm where he was kidnapped on Saturday morning alongside. The reverend’s wife, children and a man, who accompanied them, were also said to have been abducted. But the abductors released the wife and children after three hours, asking her to go look for money to pay ransom for her husband’s release. It was learnt that a vigilance group in Issele-Uku and Issele-Mkpitime had been alerted and a search party dispatched into the bush to rescue the victims. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the kidnap, adding that the police had waded into the incident. He said police had started combing the bush to rescue them. He stated, “Yes, the command has been alerted and we immediately sent officers to comb the bush. Our men are already in the bush to rescue the victims.”Copyright PUNCH.
