Toni Ufoh Former Arsenal midfielder, Santi Carzola, says current Villarreal teammate, Samuel Chukwueze is the fastest player he’s shared the pitch with. Carzola, the La Liga 2006/2007 Footballer of The Year singled out the Eagles player for encomiums over his performance and contributions to the El Submarino Amarillo. Carzola had revealed to Marca that he received calls from England, notably from Arsenal on Chukwueze’s performance for the club. Carzola said, “They ask me about them (Chukwueze and Pau Torres) and think they can make the jump to the Premiership tomorrow. “It’s good that great teams are interested in young players from Villarreal but for the moment I tell them to leave them alone here,” he told The Boot Room. Chukwueze, the AFCON 2019 Bronze medalist is on the radar of English Premier League giants Arsenal FC as the gunners are looking to find a long term replacement for Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The  20-year-old former Diamond Football Academy has scored three goals in 26 matches for the Yellow Submarine this season and he has three assists to his name as Transfermarkt rates him as 13 percent proficient in goal participation for his club. The Super Eagles player was described as a “Precocious winger with UEFA Europa League experience”  by UEFA’s official website and he was named the Nigeria Football Federation’s young player of the year for 2017/18 respectively.
