A consultant orthodontist at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Prof Idia Ize-Iyamu, has been donating food items and other relief packages to persons with disabilities and other vulnerable residents of Edo State because of the restrictions in the state due to the  coronavirus pandemic. According to her husband, Pastor Ize-Iyamu,  Idia is doing  this in collaboration with her family and friends as a continuation of her developmental interventions in rural communities. Ize-Iyamu also said that his organisation would produce more  hand sanitisers and informational materials for distribution across the state, with special focus on essential service providers, such as journalists and health workers, who will remain in the line of duty despite the restrictions in place. The All Progressives Congress chieftain said, “In a bid to escalate our ongoing efforts to curtail the spread of the virus here at home, we have produced more hand sanitisers and sensitisation handbills for distribution to our people. Specifically, we will be donating these sanitisers across the state and we shall also focus on journalists, bus drivers, health workers and other essential services providers who, despite the restriction of movement, may be required to remain mobile and operative. “In the same vein, my wife, Pastor Idia Ize-Iyamu, and some of her friends and family will be sending food and other relief packages to the disabled and other vulnerable citizens in the state who will be most affected by the disruption of the local economy.” He also enjoined other people of means in the state to follow their example and support the government in its bid to contain the virus in the state.
