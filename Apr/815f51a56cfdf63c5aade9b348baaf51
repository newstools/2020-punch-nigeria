Olaleye Aluko, Abuja Electricity consumers within the coverage zone of the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company Plc., who have yet to defray their electricity bills, will not be cut off from supplies until the period of lockdown is over, the company has said. This, the company said, was in recognition of the tense situation occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic in the country in particular and the world at large. The states covered by IBEDC are Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Kwara, Niger, Ekiti and Kogi. The Chief Operating Officer of IBEDC, John Ayodele, who made the disclosure said, “IBEDC is a customer-centric organisation, with the welfare and well-being of its customers at heart. “The management has decided to suspend the disconnection of non-paying customers to help alleviate the hardship and pressure that Nigerians are facing as a result of the lockdown across our franchise. “Furthermore, as much as it is within our remit and control, we will ensure regular and steady supply of power to make the stay-at-home order more bearable, bearing in mind the attendant challenges and pressure that this pandemic has brought on us.” He explained that the IBEDC staff on essential duties (the technical crew) would be attending to faults during the period under the supervision of its Health, Safety and Environment in keeping with the NCDC and World Health Organisation’s safety protocols. He urged customers to take advantage of the alternate payment channels, including the online platform in order to reduce physical contacts and likely exposure to the virus at crowded locations.
