Ebenezer Bajela Premier League giants, Liverpool, have reportedly opened talks with representatives of Victor Osimhen over the possibility of joining the Reds in the summer. The 2015 U-17 World Cup Golden Boot winner has been a target for many European clubs after his impressive performance for Lille in Ligue 1. Osimhen joined the French outfit from Sporting Charleroi for €12m in August 2019 and still has another four-and-a-half-year left on his contract. With his current form for Les Dogues, where he scored 13 goals from 27 league matches, the club may lose their most prized asset and French media outlet Le 10 Sport claims the current European champions have started talks with the player’s representatives. “Courted by several large British clubs, Victor Osimhen is particularly interesting for Liverpool. His representatives have entered into discussions with the Reds,” the website wrote.
