United Capital Plc, a Pan-African financial and investment services Group says it has successfully raised N5.3bn in a series 1 and 2 Commercial Paper issuance, under its N20bn programme registered with the FMDQ Securities Exchange. The Commercial Paper issuance, which was approved by the company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of March 2018, was subjected to regulatory approvals and borne out of the Group’s strategic initiatives, aimed at providing innovative financing solutions to its corporate, institutional and government (parastatals, sovereign and sub-sovereigns) clients, it said in a statement. According to the Group Chief Executive Officer, Peter Ashade, “The Commercial Paper issuance will enable us provide a wider range of wholesale financing solutions to our clients. “It will also further complement our stable funding base and support the growth of our overall business. “The Series 1 & 2 issuances, with tenors of 182 days and 270 days, were largely subscribed to by individual and institutional investors, with interest significantly tilted towards the 270-day offering.” Copyright PUNCH.
