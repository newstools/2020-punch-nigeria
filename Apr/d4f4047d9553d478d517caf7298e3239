Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Nigerian Air Force said on Friday it had trained some medical personnel on the conduct of aeromedical evacuation missions to airlift COVID-19 patients and others to treatment facilities. Our correspondent learnt that the week-long training ended with a simulation on Thursday at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, while inspecting the simulation exercise, said, “We decided to organise a course handled by one of our officers who has been trained in the United States. The participants in this course are not only medical personnel; we have flight engineers and other categories of personnel who should be captured. “They are well-grounded in aero-medical evacuation. It is not only for COVID-19 patients but also for troops in the North-East. They are put in the aircraft with all the levels of support and lifesaving equipment the patients require. “I was made to understand that this aircraft can carry 76 patients with life support equipment attached so that those patients can be monitored even on air. This is so that they can get all the necessary medical support they require before getting to their destinations.” The NAF on April 15 inaugurated a seven-day training for the nurses with Aero-medical Evacuation and Intensive Care Unit experience, aimed at enhancing the knowledge of participants in Flight Aero-medical Evacuation Systems as well as Aircraft Security and Aviation Safety. The air force said the training was also to “enable them to carry out envisaged airlift tasks in relation to the current health emergency more effectively and efficiently.” Copyright PUNCH.
