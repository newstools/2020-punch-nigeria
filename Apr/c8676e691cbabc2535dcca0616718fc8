Samson Folarin The Chairman of UBA Group and Heirs Holdings, Tony Elumelu, has reportedly donated six trailer-load of rice to Onicha-Ugbo and Onicha-Uku, the hometowns of his parents in Delta State. Several other towns in the state were said to have benefited from the palliatives for the COVID-19 lockdown. A statement on Monday said the council areas that benefited included Aniocha North, Aniocha South, Oshimili North and Oshimili South. “Out of the six trailer loads, his mother’s town, Onicha-Ugbo, got one, his father’s place, Onicha-Uku, got one; one trailer each is for Aniocha North, Aniocha South, Oshimili North and Oshimili South LGA’s. Residents of the communities prayed for him for remembering them at this trying period,” the statement added. A member of the Onicha Ugbo palace, Chief Ken Iwelumo, was quoted to have said a total of 600 bags of rice were received by the communities. He appreciated the gesture of the UBA boss and prayed for more blessings on his business. Copyright PUNCH.
