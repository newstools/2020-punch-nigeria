Samuel Awoyinfa The Standards Organisation of Nigeria says it is deploying 28 relevant international standards to support the manufacturing industry and importation of essential materials to combat the challenges of COVID-19. A statement from the organisation quoted the Director-General, Mr Osita Aboloma, as saying that the SON got the standards from the International Organisation for Standardisation and the African Organisation for Standardisation on alcohol-based hand sanitisers. Aboloma said the deployment of the standards was to meet emergency needs occasioned by COVID-19 globally while the process for the adoption would continue unhindered in spite of the lockdown. He added that the standards, being provided at no cost to local manufacturers, were also made available to the National Committee on Sustainable Production and Delivery of Essential Commodities during the COVID-19 pandemic of which SON is a member. He stated, “This is to guide local manufacturers as well as provide a benchmark for adjudging all imported products in the category during the pandemic. “With this offer, Nigeria as an eligible member will be assigned a zoom account for developing countries, which we can share with our technical committee members and experts, creating the equivalent of a ‘virtual conference room’ at the national level.” The SON boss called on TC members across the nation to expect invitations from its secretariat for participation in the consideration and adoption of several international standards from the ISO resources, to support global efforts in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis. ”Copyright PUNCH.
