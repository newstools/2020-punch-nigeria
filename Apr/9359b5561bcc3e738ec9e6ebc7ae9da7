Wale Oyewale, Ibadan Some travellers, who were said to be coming from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, were arrested in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Wednesday. The returnees, who were intercepted by the men of the Oyo State Police Command at the Ibadan end of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, were said to have resisted attempts by security agents to hand them over to the state’s COVID-19 task force. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Olugbenga Fadeyi, said, “The people were coming from Abidjan and they were accosted. Efforts are in place to hand them over to the COVID-19 team in Oyo State for assessment.” Fadeyi, however, could not give details on the number of the arrested persons, their sex, age, mission and where they were heading for as of the time of filing this report. Meanwhile, the Aseyin of Iseyin in Oyo State, Oba Abdul-Ganiy Adekunle, has brought traditional dimension to the battle against coronavirus by appeasing the dieties in the land to ward off the virus from the state. As part of the ritual, adherents of Oro, Elegbara and Egungun deities, led by the Owolewa masquerade, were at the palace. The monarch said, “This appeasement is in consonance with historical activities of our forefathers, especially whenever there was outbreak of epidemic.” Copyright PUNCH.
