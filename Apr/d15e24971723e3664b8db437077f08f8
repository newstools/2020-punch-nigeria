Anna Okon The Trade Union of Congress of Nigeria has called on the Federal Government to drop the idea of flying in medical doctors from China to help combat the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic. The workers’ body said the move wouldn’t be necessary since Nigerian doctors were  on top of the challenge. TUC made this call on Monday,  in a statement by its president, Quadri Olaleye, and secretary general, Musa-Lawal Ozigi. It stated, “As an organisation, we sincerely appreciate the Chinese authorities  for releasing their doctors and some of their best hands despite the catastrophic effect the virus had on the country recently. “However, it is important to state here that the minimal number of people infected and deaths is a proof that we are not doing badly in our effort to handle the situation. “Truly the Chinese authorities have done well by not recording more cases in their country. It is novel and also shows their proactiveness and commitment to crises. “That notwithstanding, we insist that we do not need them now; rather we shall continue to adhere to the precautions reeled out by the health professionals to make the job easy.” Speaking about the controversy surrounding the planned rollout of 5G technology in the country, TUC said although the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Patanmi, had said no licence had been issued for deployment of 5G in Nigeria. “That makes it a bit confusing. We would want the Federal Government to set up a committee of professionals to research on the development as it will help to address the fears of many Nigerians. We must collectively work to ensure the welfare, health and security of Nigerians are not taken for granted,” it added. Copyright PUNCH.
