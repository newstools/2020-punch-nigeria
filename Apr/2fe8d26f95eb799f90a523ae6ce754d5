The governor said, “I am happy to inform you that 10 more #COVID19 patients; three females and seven males including three foreign nationals, two Indians and one Filipino have been discharged from our isolation facilities at Yaba and Onikan to reunite with the society. “The patients, three from Mainland Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba and seven from Onikan Isolation Centre were discharged today having fully recovered and tested negative for #COVID19 in two consecutive test readings. “With this, the total number of cases successfully managed and discharged from our isolation facilities has risen to 117. “What this shows is that as the number of confirmed cases rise, we are also maintaining a significant discharge rate of our active cases which unequivocally shows that our medical interventions and management of the cases are working. “While I am encouraged by the support we have received so far from the good citizens of the State in the battle against #COVID19, I urge you all not to relent, keep faith with us trusting that this war is a must-win! “Remember to practice hand hygiene, join our #MaskUpLagos campaign by using a facemask especially when outdoor, and do not forget to observe strictly the Social Distancing principle.”
