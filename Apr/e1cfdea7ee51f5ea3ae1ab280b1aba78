Football legend Pele recognised at 79 that he was always a Vasco de Gama fan despite playing for Santos and New York Cosmos. Pelé said in an interview that Santos, the team that made him famous and which he played almost his whole career for, was never the team of his dreams. In an interview with the Youtube channel ‘Pilhado’, Edson Arantes do Nascimento recognised that he has always been a Vasco da Gama fan. “Most of my friends and my father’s friends were Corinthians fans, or Club Atlético Bauru or Club Noroeste de Bauru fans, but from Brazil, most of them are Corinthians fans”, he began by narrating his beginnings in football. However, It came as a surprise that Vasco da Gama stayed as his favourite team despite playing all his life at Santos. “I don’t know why I stopped being a Vasco da Gama fan. I started to like Vasco and I became a Vasco fan. I didn’t leave, I’m a Vasco fan. In case you don’t remember, I’m a Vasco fan”, he stressed several times.
