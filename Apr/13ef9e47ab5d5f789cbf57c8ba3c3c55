Peter Dada, Akure An unidentified airforce officer, a corpse and over 50 people were ‘arrested’ by the Ondo State Task Force for violating the curfew imposed by the government. The state governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, had imposed an indefinite curfew from 7pm to 7am as part of measures to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus disease in the state. Aside  the curfew, the governor also ordered the closure of its borders to all persons and vehicles except the ones conveying food and other essentials. Meanwhile, a source said many travellers passing through the state had been arrested for allegedly violating the government’s order. The source explained that the corpse was being taken to Kogi State for burial while the task force arrested the driver and some other persons along the Akure-Ilesa Expressway at Owena border town. In his reaction, the Special Adviser to Akeredolu on Transport and member of the Transport and Public Hygiene, Mr Tobi Ogunleye, explained that the persons were apprehended and their vehicles impounded for violating the restriction order. Ogunleye, however, alleged that some security operatives were frustrating the efforts to curb COVID-19 spread by allowing travellers to pass through the state. He said, “An airforce officer who became a commercial driver during the curfew hours was arrested. The passengers in the buses said they were returning to their villages in Kano State so they could feed because ‘Lagos is now dry.’” It was gathered that a special team was organised to escort the travellers to the Kogi State border to enable them to continue their journey.
