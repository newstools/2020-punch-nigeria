Olaleye Aluko The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, have expressed shock over the death of the Chief of Staff to the President, Mallam Abba Kyari, saying his dedication to the Presidency would be missed. In a statement by Lawan’s Special Adviser on Media, Ola Awoniyi, the Senate President said, “I also extend heartfelt sympathy to the government and people of Borno State over the passage of a great son of the state. “He was deep, firm, focused and unassuming in his national assignment until his death. He was a man of deep convictions and courage who understood his role and performed it with uncommon dedication and effectiveness.” Also, Gbajabiamila condoled with the President and Kyari’s family, saying the “deaths of Mallam Abba Kyari and other Nigerians at this time call for us all to rise as a nation and fight the COVID-19 pandemic in every possible way we can.” Meanwhile, a former Senate President and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, said in a condolence letter to the President that Kyari “was a hard-working, loyal and dependable Chief of Staff, who discharged his duties with uncommon commitment and diligence.” A former Senator of Kogi West District, Dino Melaye, also condoled with the President over Kyari’s death.
