British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s fiancée, Carrie Symonds, on Wednesday, gave birth to a “healthy baby boy” in a London hospital, a spokesman for the couple said. “Both mother and baby are doing very well,” the spokesman said in a surprise announcement, as Symonds was not thought to be due until later in the year.
