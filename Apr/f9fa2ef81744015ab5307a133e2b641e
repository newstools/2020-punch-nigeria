Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja In the wake of the death of the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, from the dreaded coronavirus, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has warned Nigerians to refrain from attending mass gatherings. The centre asked Nigerians to adhere to its guidelines on safe burial of victims of the virus. The NCDC made the appeal in a message it posted across its social media handles on Saturday. The message read, “Even at this time, as we mourn loved ones lost to COVID-19, including recently deceased Chief of Staff to the President, Mallam Abba Kyari, we need to refrain from attending mass gatherings to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. “Let us #StaySafe and protect each other.” The centre said its guidance on ensuring safe and dignified burial while preventing the spread of COVID-19 can be found on its website. The guidelines read in part, “Whether a COVID-19 patient died in the health facility or in the community, the body must be granted a safe and dignified burial. The safety and well-being of everyone who tends to bodies should be the first priority. “Only burial team members that have been trained in IPC and safe burial practices should be allowed to handle dead bodies and conduct burials. “The team should have the necessary resources such as PPEs, body bags, disinfectant and appropriate transportation. “Family members, religious leaders, health care workers or mortuary staff preparing the body should wear appropriate PPE according to standard precautions (gloves, impermeable disposable gown [or disposable gown with an impermeable apron, medical mask, eye protection).”
