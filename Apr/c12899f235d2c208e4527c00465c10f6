Standard Chartered has announced that it will commit $1 billion of financing for companies that provide goods and services to help the fight against COVID-19, and those planning the switch into making products that are in high demand to fight the global pandemic. A statement from the institution listed companies to include manufacturers and distributors in the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare providers, as well as non-medical companies that have volunteered to add this capability to their manufacturing output – ventilators, face masks, protective equipment, sanitisers, and other consumables. Simon Cooper, CEO of Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking at Standard Chartered, said, “Clearly there’s a cost for companies to switch into these hugely in-demand items, so it’s an area where we can potentially help them get these processes up and running more quickly; and at the same time, we want to make sure that existing manufacturers and service providers get the support they need. “Our industry teams are looking across our client base and, given our understanding of clients’ current manufacturing processes, we’re assessing which companies might want to consider adding these items to their production line,” Simon added. “All financing will be subject to companies having received regulatory approvals to manufacture the goods.”
