Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Nigerian Consulate in New York, United States, has begun compiling names of stranded Nigerians willing to return home on account of the coronavirus pandemic. It said the purpose of the exercise was to enable the Federal Government to provide the necessary assistance to Nigerian nationals in the US. This was disclosed by the Consul in charge of Information and Community Relations, Mrs Ninikanwa Okey-Uche, in a statement in New York on Sunday. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had on Friday directed foreign missions to compile the names of Nigerians interested in returning home, noting that the cost would be borne by the prospective evacuees, who will be compulsorily quarantined on arrival. The consulate had directed the individuals to email their detailed information to bnura@nigeriahouse.com and cgnny@nigeriahouse.com. The statement read in part, “Information received will be compiled and forwarded to the Nigerian Government for appropriate action. As soon as necessary arrangements are made, all concerned individuals will be informed accordingly. Please, note that the financial implications of the evacuation will be borne by the prospective evacuee.” Meanwhile, the MFA has described the commendation by the Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, on the strategies put in place to curb COVID-19 pandemic in the country as “a morale booster and laudable development.” The MFA spokesman, Ferdinand Nwonye, in a statement, reassured Nigerians of government’s continued commitment “to ensuring that those who have tested positive for COVID-19 are given good medical attention.” Copyright PUNCH.
