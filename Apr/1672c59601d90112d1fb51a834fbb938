Samuel Awoyinfa Cement manufacturing firm, Lafarge Africa Plc, says it has provided three of its facilities to serve as isolation centres for coronavirus patients in its host states during the pandemic. The Country Chief Executive Officer, Mr Khaled El- Dokani, also said the company had donated ambulances, generators, test kits and other equipment in the isolation facilities. He said, “Lafarge Africa is providing the use of three of its facilities in its host states for use as isolation centres during the pandemic. “In addition, the company is donating equipment for facilities, products for infrastructural support including generators, ambulances and critical personal protection equipment for professionals at the forefront of the battle against the coronavirus pandemic.” El- Dokani said Lafarge had provided other interventions that supported water sanitation and hygiene tagged WASH initiatives in host communities. Furthermore, he said the company’s host community engagements and sensitisation programmes on COVID-19 had so far directly impacted thousands of people at the grassroots level. He added, “Our intervention will be used to support healthcare facilities in Lagos and in our host communities. “Infrastructure and kits to protect the healthcare personnel and support staff who take care of patients are very important to ensure that our compatriots fighting to help contain COVID-19 do the job professionally and safely. “The personal protective equipment we are providing will also play an important role in containing the spread of COVID-19. Our communities have been standing by us over the years in making building materials for the development of Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
