A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Ondo State, Akinola Awodeyi-Akinsehinwa, on Sunday urged Nigerians to cooperate with the government on the efforts to check the spread of coronavirus. He also urged leaders at all levels to learn lessons from COVID-19 and take the welfare of Nigerians, particularly the poor, seriously. Akinsehinwa, who said this in a statement on Sunday, urged the nation’s leaders to take the lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritise local health care delivery by investing more in the sector. He said, “Our people should please cooperate with the Federal Government as well as the state governments on all the efforts to curtail the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. “I also advise that anybody who is sick with any of the symptoms of the virus to go to the hospital; after all coronavirus is not a death sentence if those who contracted it reported to the medical doctor early. “I think the people in government should learn from this global pandemic to build good hospitals, good schools, and provide employment for our youths. “This pandemic has taught us so many lessons in leadership. One is that before you do father Christmas, feed you immediate family first. By this I mean that before we help other nations, our people should come first; before you go on medical tourism abroad, build good hospitals for your people at home because you may need the hospital at a time like this. As politicians, we should care for our people.” Akinsehinwa, who also aspire to govern the state on the platform of the APC, urged the people to reflect on their condition and support his push for change.
