Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia The new Commissioner of Police in Abia State, Jane Agbede, has warned criminals to leave the state or face hard times. Agbede, who took over from Ene Okon on Friday, said she would improve on the structures built by her predecessor to ensure that the state was hot for criminals to operate in. The CP stated, “Those, who feel that Abia State is the centre of criminality should find their way out of the state. I am going to ensure that businesses thrive in the state and people sleep with their two eyes closed. “Though Abia is tough, I will build upon the structures on the ground.” She called for the support of the citizens to enable her to succeed in the task.
