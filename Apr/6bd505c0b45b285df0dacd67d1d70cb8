Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Independent Electoral Commission on Sunday declared that the postponed local government election earlier scheduled to hold on April 18, would now hold at a later date. The ODIEC had announced the postponement of the poll as part of measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. Spokesperson for the commission, Mr Rotimi Olorunfemi, said ODIEC was in full support of measures put in place by the state government to curtail the spread of COVID-19. Olorunfemi explained that, “Most of our local and international partners and support groups, like the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, who were supposed to train and retrain our staff and some categories of ad hoc staff, had shut down their offices. “Since the announcement of the suspension of the election, however, the commission and the public space have been inundated with lots of misinformation, insinuations and misgivings as to the motives of the commission and the reason for the indefinite suspension of the election. “The commission wishes to make it abundantly clear that the 2020 local government election in Ondo State has not been aborted or cancelled.” Copyright PUNCH.
