Sola Shittu, Benin The Nigerian Medical Association, Edo State chapter on Tuesday called for stiffer measures in the fight against the coronavirus in the state. The NMA’s call is coming on the heels of the upsurge in the number of COVID-19 cases which rose from two to 11 within 14 days in the state. In a letter written to the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, the NMA asked the stated government to move from partial lockdown of the state to a full lockdown to protect its citizens from contracting the virus. The letter jointly signed by the Chairman, Dr Valentine Omoifo; and the Secretary, Dr Anthonia Njoku, specifically called for the closure of all boundaries to the state. “We reiterate the earlier advice given by the NMA on the need to close all entry points leading into Edo State. Sadly, Edo State has continued to have increasing numbers of cases of the Covid-19 largely from new entrants into the state or those they have had contacts with. “It is our well considered opinion that Edo State immediately closes all its boundaries as several other states have done to protect their citizens with positive results. “There is need to provide incentives for medical frontline staff such as extra allowances and possible tax reliefs. The NMA is monitoring the situation very closely as uninterrupted clinical services in the hospitals may not be guaranteed in the face of obvious dangers faced by our members and other healthcare personnel.” Copyright PUNCH.
