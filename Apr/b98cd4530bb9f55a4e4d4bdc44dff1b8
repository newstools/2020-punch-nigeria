Ebenezer Bajela The Confederation of African Football has paid tribute to the all-conquering 1998 Super Falcons coached by Ismaila Mabo, The PUNCH reports. Nigeria hosted the maiden African Women’s Championship (now African Women’s Cup of Nations) 22 years ago and the Falcons took the title in an unbeaten run of five matches, scoring a remarkable 26 goals and conceding none. The Falcons started their campaign with a stunning 8-0 win over Morocco at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium in Kaduna. Captained by the then 23-year-old Florence Omagbemi, the Falcons were pure class as they subsequently decimated DR Congo 4-0 and Egypt 6-0 to finish top of their group with maximum nine points. The unstoppable Falcons would go on to hit Cameroon another six without a reply in the semi-final and defeated the Black Queens of Ghana 2-0 in the final with goals in either half by Nkiru Okosieme and Stella Mbachu.
