Wale Oyewole, Ibadan The All Progressives Congress in Oyo State has urged Governor Seyi Makinde-led administration to be more proactive in its efforts at curtailing the spread of COVID-19 in the state rather than engaging in blame game and disparaging comments to score cheap political point. The APC, in a statement in Ibadan, on Tuesday, by its Assistant Publicity Secretary, Prince Ayobami Adejumo, accused Makinde of attempting to undermine the efforts of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus. The governor, in a radio interview on Monday, faulted the Federal Government’s allocation of COVID-19 palliatives to the state. The APC in its statement said, “We are not disputing the fact that much still needed to be done to align with the rest of the world in the quest to completely defeat coronavirus and it is on this premise that we are calling for more concerted efforts from the Oyo State Government to raise its game and ensure that no stone is  left unturned in the bid to protect the people of the state from further spread.” ”Copyright PUNCH.
