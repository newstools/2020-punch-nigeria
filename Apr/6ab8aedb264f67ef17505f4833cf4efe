Toni Ufoh Former Super Winger Emmanuel Amuneke has come denied having any financial dealings with former Super Eagles coach Clemens Westerhof. Amuneke’s teammate at the 1994 World Cup in the United States, Emeka Ezeugo,  was quoted by Brila.net as saying Dutchman Westerhof fielded players who he had financial dealings with, claiming it cost the Eagles the second round 2-1 defeat against Italy in World Cup. “Clemence Westerhof wasn’t tactically focused as he was more interested in using the players that he was managing (as an agent) instead of the best players,” Bila.net quoted Ezeugo as saying. But former Tanzania coach Amuneke rubbished Ezeugo’s claims, saying as a player in the team, he earned his place and didn’t have any financial dealings with Westerhof. Amuneke told Brila.net, “Clemens Westerhof was not an agent, he was not my agent and I don’t think he was an agent. People should stop creating unnecessary controversy.” Copyright PUNCH.
