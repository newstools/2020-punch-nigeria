Dayo Ojerinde The Coca-Cola Foundation has provided a grant to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. The President of the Foundation, Ms. Helen Price, in a statement said the intervention was to scale up community sensitisation and procure essential protective kits such as medical masks, face shields, hand gloves and hand sanitisers needed by health care workers and others. She said, “We are concerned about the coronavirus outbreak across the globe. Through The Coca-Cola Foundation, we are supporting the IFRC and their efforts to distribute medical supplies to frontline workers in Africa. As a longtime partner of the IFRC, we are proud to support critical relief efforts in impacted communities.” Price added that the Nigeria Bottling Company and Chi Limited have donated table waters and Evap milk to provide hydration and nourishment for health care workers and their patients at the quarantine and treatment centres across many states of the federation. The IFRC’s Regional Director for Africa, Dr Simon Missiri, said, “The potential humanitarian impact of this partnership with The Coca-Cola Foundation is significant – aiming to directly impact 1.3 million people in Nigeria and other countries in the region. “With 1.4 million volunteers and over 12,000 local branches across Africa, the Red Cross and Red Crescent, in collaboration with partners, communities and national authorities, can help even the most remote marginalised populations to protect themselves from COVID-19.” Copyright PUNCH.
