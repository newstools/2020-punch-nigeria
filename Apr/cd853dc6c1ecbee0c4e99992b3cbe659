Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has cautioned members of the public against the fraudulent activities of some persons offering fake palliative funds with the aim of defrauding Nigerians. The acting Chairman of the EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, gave the advice on Tuesday, pointing out that some faceless elements were circulating “free N5,000 lockdown funds during the lockdown,” through a phishing link on WhatsApp. The acting Head, Media and Publicity, EFCC, Tony Orilade, in a statement, said Magu had ordered an investigation into the Internet scam and the phishing website hosted on a Google server. “However, the registration information of the website is being investigated and members of the public are advised to be wary of any lockdown funds dressed in any suspicious garb,” he cautioned. Magu reiterated the commitment of the EFCC to monitor closely the antics of fraudsters cashing in on the government lockdown directives to perpetrate criminal acts. “We would not stop bursting every scheme designed to defraud Nigerians of their hard-earned money”, he said.
