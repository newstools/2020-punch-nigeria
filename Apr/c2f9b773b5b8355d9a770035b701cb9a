Umar Muhammed, Lafia THE Special Adviser to Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State on Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Community Development, Mr John Mamman, has been kidnapped. Mamman was abducted around 8pm on Saturday from his home at Dari in the Kokona Local Government Area of the state. A source told our correspondent that Mamman and his associates were relaxing in his compound when the gunmen invaded his residence and whisked him away. The kidnappers reportedly surrounded the house and shot indiscriminately in the air before going for their target. Our correspondent gathered that luck ran out on one of the suspected kidnappers as he was nabbed by some members of the community. It was learnt that the gunmen had yet to contact Mamman’s family since the incident. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr Ramhan Nansel, confirmed the incident in a telephone interview with PUNCH Metro in Lafia. He stated that Mamman was abducted in his country home in Dari, while relaxing with his friends and associates. “The state Commissioner of Police, Mr Bola Longe, has directed the Divisional Police Officer of Garagu and the Area Commander to mobilise their men and comb the bush to ensure the rescue of the special adviser,” he said.
