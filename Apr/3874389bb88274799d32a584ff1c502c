Peter Dada, Akure As Nigerians react to the death of the Chief of Staff to the President, Mr Abba Kyari, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, said, on Sunday, the government should provide sound health-care system for the citizens . The Secretary General of the association, Sehinde Arogbofa, who spoke with our correspondent, said, “The death of Abba Kyari was disturbing to us, he was a very powerful man in the Presidency, he used his power very well. He was a de facto president of this country. “This should be a wake-up call to the government to provide standard health care for the people of this country. Our leaders are caught in the web as they had no place to run to during this pandemic. If our health sector has been well taken care of, perhaps Abba Kyari would not have died. So our government must brace up.” Meanwhile, traditional rulers in Ondo State have expressed shock and sadness over the demise of Kyari. The royal fathers, under the auspices of the Ondo State 130 Krown Obas Club, in a statement, commiserated with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), over the loss of his chief of staff. The statement was issued by the President of the royal club and the monarch of Ikare Akoko, Oba Kolapo Adegbite-Adedoyin. The statement read in part, “The obas also commiserate with the President over the death of his chief of staff, Mallam Abba Kyari, and other deceased persons who died as a result of complications from the COVID-19 pandemic.” Copyright PUNCH.
