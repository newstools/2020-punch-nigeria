Ebenezer Bajela Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Vincent Enyeama, is considering a potential switch to the ABSA Premiership with Orlando Pirates or Kaizer Chiefs as possible destinations. Enyeama, who describes South Africa as a good place to be, says he will love to go there if he gets the right offer. The 37-year-old has been without a club since he left Ligue 1 side Lille in 2018, but has refused to rule out the chance of playing again. The 2013 Africa Cup of Nations winner moved to Europe with Bnei Yehuda in 2005 from Iwuanyanwu Nationale (now Heartland) and is set to make a return to Africa as he eyes offers from the Soweto giants. Speaking to African Football HQ, Enyeama admitted that it would be difficult to let go of football which is part of his life. “Yeah, why not? Johannesburg is a good place to be,” Enyeama said. If there’s an opportunity to play at Chiefs or Pirates, why not? “Football is my life, football is my blood and if there is an opportunity to play, and if the terms and details are okay and my family and wife are okay with it, then we move.” Enyeama is Super Eagles’ most-capped player, with the two-time CAF Champions League winner making a total of 101 appearances for Nigeria between 2002 and 2015. The former Enyimba keeper called it quits with the national team in 2015. Copyright PUNCH.
