With the COVID-19 crisis affecting almost every facet of society, Apple and Google have announced that they’re partnering to work on Bluetooth technology that will allow governments and health agencies to better conduct coronavirus contact tracing. The companies stress user privacy and security will be central to the tools they develop, according to https://engadget.com. The solution they’re developing will consist of application programming interfaces and operating system-level support to “assist in enabling contact tracing.” They say they plan to deploy the tools in two steps. To start, next month they’ll release APIs that will allow for interoperability between iOS and Android devices when using public health apps. Health care professionals who use those apps will be able to download them in the App Store and Google Play Store. Afterward, Apple and Google plan to allow for “broader” Bluetooth-based contact tracing by building support for the functionality directly into their mobile operating systems. They say system-level support will allow more people to participate, as well as support more interaction with a broader number of apps used by government health organizations. To address potential privacy concerns, the companies plan to develop the technologies in collaboration with “interested stakeholders.” They’ll also publish information about their ongoing work so experts and other organizations can analyze the work they’re doing. “All of us at Apple and Google believe there has never been a more important moment to work together to solve one of the world’s most pressing problems,” Google and Apple said in a joint statement. “Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.”
