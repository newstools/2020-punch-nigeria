Daud Olatunji Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has expressed shock over a N950 donation made by a nine-year-old girl, Oluwashikemi Ogunleye, to the designated state government’s account to fight against coronavirus in the state. Abiodun said he was thrilled by the small but significant donation from the girl, describing her as a “symbol of the future we are building together.” Abiodun stated this during a press briefing held at his Iperu Remo residence in Ikenne Local Government Area of the state. The governor explained that Ogunleye used the USSD code designed for the state to donate the money. He said, “I am particularly thrilled by the small but very significant donation from the youngest donor so far, Oluwashikemi Ogunleye. “She used our USSD Code to donate N950. “Oluwashikemi, I am proud to be the governor of a philanthropist like you. You are indeed the symbol of giving of ourselves to ourselves and the future we are building together. I call on others to come forward and support the fight against COVID.” Copyright PUNCH.
