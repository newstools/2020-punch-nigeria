DAUD OLATUNJI The Federal Road Safety Corps in Ogun State says it has impounded 70 vehicles which defied government’s directives since the COVID-19 lockdown started in the state. The FRSC Sector Commander in the state, Clement Oladele, said on Saturday that only vehicles not covered by the presidential waiver were seized. Oladele added that the goal of the presidential directive special operations was to arrest motorists but to ensure stoppage of vehicular traffic. He however explained that only vehicles whose drivers were being prosecuted by the FRSC would remain impounded until after the court judgment He said, “They disobeyed government’s directive, except for vehicles with presidential waivers, especially vehicles conveying petroleum products or those transporting agricultural goods and vehicles of persons categorised as being on essential services. “This, therefore, has removed about 85 per cent of the 380,000 vehicles operating on highways across Ogun State. The corps has not changed its policy on release of impounded vehicles. “Those apprehended but could make online payments either through their mobile devices or with the POS were released immediately.’’ Oladele said the level of compliance with the lockdown order remained high in the state He added that there were still some motorists feigning ignorance of the dangers COVID-19 portended in the community.
