Eniola Akinkuotu Robbers in the early hours of Wednesday attacked Anthony Village as well as Iju Ishaga area of Lagos State, The PUNCH has learnt. Residents in the affected communities told our correspondent that the assailants, who were mostly youths, were over 50 in number. A resident of Adebayo Mokuolu Street, Anthony Village, said the hoodlums came through the Gbagada Expressway. He said, “Some hoodlums came into our community through the Newcastle Hotel and they vandalised vehicles. They couldn’t make their way around Anthony easily because most of the streets have gates. “Luckily, some local security men were able to repel them but they threatened to return in their numbers. We reported the matter to the Anthony Police Division.” A resident of Iju told The PUNCH that hoodlums also attacked several persons on Monday and Tuesday even in broad daylight. The resident, who wished to remain anonymous, told our correspondent that the hoodlums, who wielded knives, vandalised many vehicles and even entered people’s homes. He said, “We formed groups of vigilantes last night and kept vigil in order to prevent those boys from coming into our houses. These young guys are less than age 25. Even during the day time, they attack people, snatch phones and ATM cards. “On Tuesday they went on the rampage on Alfred Williams Street. So, at night, we prepared ourselves by forming vigilance groups. We usually inform the policemen at Iju Police Station, Red House, but they never arrive on time. “We seriously need increased police presence here if this lockdown will last longer.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, told The PUNCH that security is being beefed up across the state, adding that any hoodlum caught disturbing the peace would be dealt with. He said, “We have stationed our men in strategic places across the state. We have increased our presence more than ever.”
