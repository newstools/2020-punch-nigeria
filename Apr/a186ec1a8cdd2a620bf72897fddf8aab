Up-and-coming defender, Timisire Adedoyin, says he is eager to return to Europe to further his career after an earlier stint in Azerbaijan. The 20-year-old,  who spent a year in Azerbaijan league playing for Insensor  FK,  a third division side,  admitted that the path to professional football stardom for many Nigerian players was fraught with daunting challenges, adding that with hard work and perseverance, the road to glory was assured. The right-back stated, “My time in Azerbaijan wasn’t bad, it was an eye-opener in more ways than one.  I am a right-back but I can play as a wing-back depending on the formation of the coach. “I want to play for a European team that would offer me the chance to develop technically and become a better professional player who can compete with the best in the world.” He added, “My role model is Dani Alves because he is one of the best players and every footballer playing in that position look up to him for inspiration. Football has always been my passion and there is nothing more I want than to play professional football for a living.” Copyright PUNCH.
