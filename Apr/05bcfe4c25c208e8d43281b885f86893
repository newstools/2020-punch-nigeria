Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki Ebonyi State on Wednesday recorded its second COVID-19 case. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Dan Umezuruike, said the suspect was a 27-year-old man, who was arrested on Saturday by the police at Ishieke Junction in (Ebonyi State), on his way from Asaba, Delta State. Umezuruike said, “Ebonyi State has recorded another case of COVID-19. It involves a 27-year-old man returning from Asaba, Delta State. He was coming with his seven-month pregnant wife and  his house-help. “The bus carrying them stopped at Isheke Junction and because of the curfew, they could not proceed on their journey before they encountered some policemen who arrested them and took them to the stadium which is our standard. “So we conducted test on them. The man tested positive. The wife’s result is still inconclusive; while the house-help’s result tested negative.” The commissioner further said the patient had been taken to the isolation centre for medical attention, adding that he had only shown intermittent headache.
