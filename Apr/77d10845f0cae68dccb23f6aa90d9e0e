Nike Popoola The board of directors of the African Development Bank Group has approved a new trust fund aimed at pushing forward gender equality and women’s empowerment across the continent. Funded by donors, the AfDB said the fund would support the delivery and scale-up of the bank’s Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa programme and promote gender transformative lending and non-lending operations. It added that it was the first thematic fund on gender in the bank’s history. The fund would be established for an initial period of 10 years, it stated. Copyright PUNCH.
