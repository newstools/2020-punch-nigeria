Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt RIVERS State Governor, Nyesom Wike, on Sunday, said his administration had set in motion a process for the distribution of foods to residents of the state following the sit-at-home directive to check the spread of coronavirus. Wike, who disclosed this in Port Harcourt on Sunday after inspecting the state food bank, said a state committee would soon be set up to implement the distribution of the foodstuffs. “We are going to set up a committee for the distribution of the foodstuffs meant to serve as palliative for Rivers people,” he said. Wike warned against the politicisation of the fight against coronavirus, saying all stakeholders must make sacrifices. “We say to our people, this is not a time to play politics. Nobody should play politics with the lives of people. Everybody has to make sacrifices to make sure everyone stays alive,” he said. “For now, we are not 100 per cent ready, but we are about 90 per cent ready. Luckily for us, we have no serious cases. The confirmed case is doing very well. They have sent her samples and it came out negative. The final sample has been sent and we are expecting the results.” Wike identified some of the food items at the state food bank as rice, garri, beans, noodles, yam, palm oil and salt, adding that they would be distributed to the less privileged in all the 23 local government areas of the state. On the monitoring of compliance by churches, the governor said the task force was happy with the level of cooperation from the churches. Wike also inspected the progress of work at the State Isolation/Treatment Centre under construction. Copyright PUNCH.
