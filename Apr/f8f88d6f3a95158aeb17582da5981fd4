Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State on Tuesday said the Amotekun security network might become a failure with the appointment of Amitolu Shittu as its director-general in the state. According to a statement by the party Chairman, Olasoji Adagunodo, the new Amotekun boss is a member of the All Progressives Congress. Adagunodo said although Oyetola could engage whoever he considered good enough for the position, such appointment should not be done at the expense of people’s security. He said, “Amotekun may be heading for the rocks if technical handlers of the outfit are highly partisan persons, which the appointment of Mr Amitolu seems to represent. “The appointment patently runs foul of the state House of Assembly legislation establishing Amotekun in the state, either in title or descriptive stipulations of persons suitable for such an appointment.” However, the APC Director of Publicity, Research and Strategy, Kunle Oyatomi, queried the PDP’s opposition to the appointment of Shittu, labelling the opposition party a noisemaker. “The governor, after due and widespread consultations with stakeholders to tackle insecurity on a long-term basis, appointed Amitolu Shittu as the director-general of Amotekun, the well-received South-West security outfit,” Oyatomi said.
