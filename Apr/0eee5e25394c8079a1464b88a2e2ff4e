SOLA SHITTU Three persons were on Friday injured in an alleged attack on vigilante men by Amendo worshippers and Internet fraudsters (popularly known as Yahoo boys) at Dagbala, in the Akoko-Edo area of Edo state. An eyewitness, Mr. Kehinde Livinus, said the leader of the community vigilance group, Mr Steven Felix, said the security men were attacked while trying to enforce the stay-at-home directive by the state government. He said they had gone to disperse a gathering of the Amendo worshippers and some Yahoo boys before the situation turned violent. Livinus stated that three vigilantes sustained injuries in the attack. He said, “Those that were injured were immediately rushed to a private hospital at Ososo for medical attention. One of us required N150,000 for operation but the community could only raise N50,000 for it. “The traditional ruler of the community had earlier in the week directed that festivals, burials, weddings and all public gatherings should be discouraged to prevent the spread of coronavirus in and around Dagbala and directed the vigilantes to enforce compliance.” Our correspondent learnt that four suspects had been arrested by the police in Ososo in connection with the incident. Efforts to get the reactions of the state police Commissioner, Mr. Lawan Jimeta, and the spokesperson for the police, Mr. Chidi Nwabuzor on the matter proved abortive as they neither picked up phone calls nor replied to messages sent to their mobiles.
