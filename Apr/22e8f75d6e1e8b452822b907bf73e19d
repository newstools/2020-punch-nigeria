Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives has asked the Federal Government to ensure equal distribution of COVID-19 palliative funds and other essential materials to the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The opposition lawmakers said this in a statement signed by the Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, on Wednesday. They warned that the “current selective approach adopted by the Federal Government in allotting palliatives to states is unacceptable and counter-productive to the overall national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.” They noted that the alleged selective approach by the Federal Government was already sending “wrong signals, fuelling avoidable divisiveness, allegations and counter-allegations of political and sectional marginalisation in the polity and must be checked immediately.” Elumelu added, “The Federal Government should bear in mind that the social and economic challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic cut across all the states of the federation. “It affects all Nigerians because they operate under the same economy and lockdown directives. Therefore, the selective approach in dissemination of aids and palliatives is not in the best interest of our nation. It will only send a very wrong signal and exacerbate the situation. “What is expected at the moment is an even distribution of aids and palliatives to all states of the federation in a manner that extensively addresses the needs of the masses at this critical time.” Copyright PUNCH.
