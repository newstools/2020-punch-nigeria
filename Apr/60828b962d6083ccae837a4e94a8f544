Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi The Bauchi Government has lifted the curfew it earlier placed on the state barely five hours to its commencement. The government said the decision was taken in view of the fact that it did not make any arrangement for palliatives for the people. The state government had on Tuesday ordered a total lockdown of the state beginning from 6pm on Thursday for a period of 14 days to curtail the spread of coronavirus. But at a press conference at the Government House on Thursday, the Deputy Governor, Baba Tela, said having observed that no palliative measures had been introduced to cushion the effects of the lockdown, the  government felt that the process must be addressed in a manner that wold not create harm or social dislocation. “Consequently, we are putting emphasises on borders so that unsuspected carriers of the virus do not infiltrate and spread the virus.” He said all the borders leading to the state would be shut down from  April 2 by 6pm, so that unsuspecting carriers of the virus would not infiltrate or spread the virus in the state. “This social distance is to be maintained in mosques and churches, markets, weddings and social ceremonies,” he said. The Deputy Governor said  two out of the three confirmed COVID-19 patients in the state would soon be discharged. He said 99 people had so far been tested for the deadly disease in the state, however, only three had been confirmed positive and 96 tested negative. “Out of the three that have turned positive, two would soon be discharged after the mandatory 14 days isolation,” Tela said.
