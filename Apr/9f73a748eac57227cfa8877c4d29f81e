Tukur Muntari, Kano The Kano State Government says it has cordoned off all the Tsangaya schools in Kano metropolis where the five Almajiris who tested positive for coronavirus in Kaduna came from. Recall that the Kaduna State Government had, on Monday, announced that five of the 195 Almajiri children evacuated from Kano tested positive for the virus. The Kano State Commissioner for Education and Chairman of the Almajiri Evacuation Committee, Alhaji Sanusi Kiru, said on Wednesday that the measure was to ensure that the schools were disinfected to prevent the spread of the disease in the state. He said all suspected children and their teachers would be quarantined while contact tracing of those who had contact with the infected Almajiris had commenced. “Before we evacuated those children to their various states of origin, some medical personnel checked their health status and their temperature was normal,” Kiru said. According to him, the state government had medical records of all the evacuated Almajiris in addition to knowing which Tsangaya school they came from. The Kano State Government had within the last one week evacuated over 1,000 Almajiris to Katsina, Jigawa and Kaduna states. Copyright PUNCH.
