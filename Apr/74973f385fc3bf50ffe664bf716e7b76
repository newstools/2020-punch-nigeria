Oladimeji Ramon The District Governor of Rotary International, District 9125, Dr Victor Onukwugha, has advised government against a total lockdown of the country. Onukwugha said total lockdown would create tension and anxiety among Nigerians. A statement in Lagos on Monday said Onukwugha spoke in the Abuja Municipal Area Council when Rotary Club distributed foodstuffs to 1,000 poor people. He said, “The lockdown for one month is not a joke. People have to eat. They are already hungry. It is actually individual Rotarians who have contributed their money through their clubs to do this. We have beans, garri, oil, tomatoes, rice and other condiments in a bag. “The lockdown is a temporary thing and for me we cannot lockdown permanently otherwise, we will create another problem which is already surfacing, which has to do with the economy. “In develop countries where they have lockdown, people are still working from home but in Nigeria, there is no infrastructure to work from home. People cannot stay out of work for too long. “And in Nigeria, apart from government, the construction industry is the second largest employer in the country. And when you look at that industry, 70 per cent of those who are employed in that industry depend on daily work.” Copyright PUNCH.
