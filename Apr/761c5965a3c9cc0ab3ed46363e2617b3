Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Some gunmen in the early hours of Friday invaded Gbagyi Villa in the Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing a polytechnic student and kidnapping two others. The incident took place between 1am and 2am, an eyewitness said, adding that those abducted by the hoodlums were a couple. The latest attack is coming as the state is on lockdown aimed at curtailing the spread of coronavirus pandemic in the state.  The eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the residents alerted the police when the incident occurred. “When the police arrived at the scene, they got another distressed call from a nearby community and left immediately,” he said. It was also gathered that a National Diploma student in Zamfara State, who came out on hearing the cry of the couple, was shot dead by the gunmen. Chairman of the Vigilance Group in Gbagyi Villa, Emmanuel Martins, confirmed the incident, describing it as disturbing and unfortunate. The Chairman Gbagyi Villa Property Owners Association, Mr Chris Obodumu, appealed to the government to beef up security around communities in the state. He said, “The gunmen in large numbers broke into the home of the couple, Mr and Mrs Jack Uwenke and abducted them. They left their children crying.” “A National Diploma student at Kaura Namoda Polytechnic, Gusau, Zamfara State, Stephen Sebastin, who was a neighbour to the abducted couple, came out on hearing noises to help but was shot dead in the process.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, ASP Mohammed Jalige, did not pick our correspondent’s calls to his mobile and had yet to reply to a text message on the incident as of press time.
