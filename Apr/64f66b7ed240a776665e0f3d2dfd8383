Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri United Nations Children’s Fund in order to minimize the effect of COVID-19 on education in Borno State is distributing 1,500 radio sets in communities. The United Nations agency, in conjunction with the Borno State Universal Basic Education Board, is also introducing a pilot radio learning programme to educate more than 250,000 vulnerable children in the North-East state. The Education Manager, UNICEF Borno Field Office, Dr Nasser Kaddoura, made this known on Monday in Maiduguri after a meeting of a 13-member committee set up by SUBEB to implement response strategies to the impact of COVID-19 on basic education in the state. According to Kaddoura, the programme will minimise the impact of school closure on learners. Kaddoura said, “Children in North-East Nigeria are conflict-affected and behind in terms of school enrolment and retention. UNICEF, with support from Education Cannot Wait, will continue to initiate novel learning patterns and support the state government in its resolve to expand education access to conflict-affected children.” In a statement, the Chairman of the SUBEB Committee, Ali Bukar Dogo, noted that SUBEB had mobilised relevant stakeholders to facilitate the success of the programme.
