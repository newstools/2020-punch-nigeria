Kayode Oyero The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) has said coronavirus treatment and isolation centres would be built around the country’s airports and land borders. He made this known on Monday night in an address to the nation. The PUNCH reports that the retired major general extended a two-week lockdown in Abuja as well as Lagos and Ogun States which ends on Monday night by another 14 days. This was as the total number of cases in the country hit 343 with 189 and 56 infections in Lagos and Abuja respectively. Buhari said, “To date, we have identified 92% of all identified contacts while doubling the number of testing laboratories in the country and raising our testing capacity to 1,500 tests per day. “Lagos and Abuja today have the capacity to admit some 1,000 patients each across several treatment centres. “Many State Governments have also made provisions for isolation wards and treatment centres. We will also build similar centers near our airports and land borders. “Using our resources and those provided through donations, we will adequately equip and man these centres in the coming weeks. “Our hope and prayers are that we do not have to use all these centres. But we will be ready for all eventualities.”
