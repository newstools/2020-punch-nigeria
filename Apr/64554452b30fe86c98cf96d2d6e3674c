Enyioha Opara, Minna The Niger State Government has relaxed the curfew imposed as part of measures to curb the spread of coronavirus disease in the state. The new curfew takes effect from 2 pm to 10 pm beginning from April 5 as against the earlier order of 10 a.m. to 12 midnight. Secretary to the State Government and Chairman Niger Task Force on COVID-19, Ahmed Matane, disclosed this on Sunday while addressing newsmen in Minna. Matane said that the measure was to enable people to stock food and other essentials needs. He said markets would now be opened from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. to enable people to buy foodstuffs and other essentials, adding that marketers should adhere strictly to the precautionary measures of the Ministry of Health. He explained that civil servants on grade level 1-12, earlier directed to stay at home, are to resume work on April 6 from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Matane said, “Government had earlier imposed a curfew from 10 am to midnight following residents non-compliance to the sit-at-home order as well as nonchalant attitude of some people towards the prevention of COVID-19 in the state. “In this new order of relaxing curfew from 2 pm to 10 pm, civil servants on grade level 1-12 earlier directed to stay at home as part of measures taken by the government to curb the spread of COVID-19 are now to resume work on Monday, April 6, 2020, from 8 am to 2 pm.” He said that intra and inter-state movement of people and vehicles across the state remained banned. “All entry point to the state remain closed except to those on essential services,” he added.
