John Charles, Makurdi Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has reinstated 33 sacked resident doctors of the Benue State Teaching Hospital, Makurdi. Recall that the management of the teaching hospital served the affected doctors with termination letters few days ago. However, the state President of the Association of Resident Doctors, Benue State University Teaching Hospital Makurdi, Dr Amina Onyewuchi, in a statement she issued on Wednesday said they had been recalled. Onyewuchi, who praised the governor for his prompt intervention, explained that following their meeting with the governor on Easter day and his subsequent intervention, the association had decided to suspend the strike and toe the line of peace. “From the governor’s antecedents with the association, there was no reason to doubt his ability to amicably resolve the problem. Thank God, the governor has ordered the hospital management to withdraw the letters of expiration/termination of residency training issued to over 30 of our members. “To be candid, since Samuel Ortom came into office, there has never been any challenge confronting us that has not been solved by the governor starting from the implementation of our teaching allowances in 2017 to the payment of our skipping arrears in 2019. “We know the antecedent of our governor and that is why we tried to use every available means to get his attention when 33 of our members were issued letters of expiration / termination of their residency training,” Onyewuchi stated. The president, however, apologised to the governor for taken the “in-house” matter to the media, stressing that it was not aimed at tarnishing Ortom’s image or that of his government.
