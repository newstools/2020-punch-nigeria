Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, on Monday said he did not have a hand in the crisis rocking the Unity Forum bloc in the All Progressives Congress. The forum is a group in the party, led by a former deputy governor of the state, Alhaji Ali Olanusi, and had vowed to present the candidate of the party for the October governorship election at the expense of the governor. Speaking through the state Commissioner for Information, Mr Donald Ojogo, Akeredolu denied sponsoring the crisis in the forum. He said, “There is none among those governorship aspirants that the governor had not had personal encounter with in terms of conflicting relationship but they will always come together as leaders of the party and they will settle. “We have Olusola Oke there; we have Ife Oyedele, Segun Abraham, Senator Boroffice. Who among them will now make himself available to be used? In any case, they all know that the most unexpected person to strike such a deal with in that manner is Akeredolu because he won’t have time for that (distabilising the group). So, these are stories that are being concocted and sponsored by people who are already losing out.” He also cautioned against using the present COVID-19 pandemic as a political weapon, saying the APC did not manufacture it and the disease did not differentiate between the APC and the PDP members.
