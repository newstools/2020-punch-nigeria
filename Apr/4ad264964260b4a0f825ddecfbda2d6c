Raphael Ede A former university lecturer, Professor David Ngene, has accused a Chief Superintendent of Police, Danladi Mashat, of using his powers to harass and intimidate him. In a petition addressed to the chairman of the Police Service Commission, Musiliu Smith, the Enugu-born professor recalled how CSP Mashat, the Divisional Police Officer, Independence Layout Station, Enugu, allegedly arrested and harassed workers at his proposed university site. He said despite his limited knowledge of the law, he was aware that the police had no powers to interfere in land matters unless there was a violent dispute. He wrote, “I am also aware that except a piece of land is the subject of a violent dispute leading to crimes, the Nigeria Police have no right whatsoever over lands. “With my limited knowledge of the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as it relates to the extent of the powers of the Nigeria Police, it amazes me why CSP Danladi Mashat has made himself a law over the land I procured with all of my life’s earnings, having laboured and retired in the United States almost two decades ago and whose title transfer was authorised by accredited representatives of the six villages that make up Ugwuaji Awkunanaw as of the said material time and as is the practice with land procurement in these parts.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
