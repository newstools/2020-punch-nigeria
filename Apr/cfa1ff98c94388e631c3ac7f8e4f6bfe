At UTL Trust Management Services, we believe everyone has a role to play in Nigeria’s fight against the spread of the novel Coronavirus disease. That is why we are pleased to support NIMR’s plan to procure 1 million Personal Protective Equipment for Testing Centres. Our donation will ensure at least 2,000 Nigerians receive free tests. As we individually stay safe by maintaining social distancing and washing our hands, we must also ensure that our healthcare workers on the frontlines are protected too. Therefore, availability of PPE is crucial to Nigeria’s fight against COVID-19. We are reminded of how intricately connected we are as humans and stress the importance of collaboration, partnership and unity during these challenging times. Finally, we celebrate the commendable efforts of Federal and State Governments, our health officials, volunteers and other authorities working tirelessly in the fight against COVID-19. Our thoughts and prayers are with all Nigerians. Signed, UTL Trustees
