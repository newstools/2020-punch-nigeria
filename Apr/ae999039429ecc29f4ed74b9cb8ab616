Samuel Awoyinfa seven-Up Bottling Company has announced the donation of two million bottles of premium drinking water and other beverages from its portfolio to the Lagos State Government and other communities across the country. The firm said the gesture was part of its corporate social responsibility aimed at boosting the emergency food response targeted at people in vulnerable communities as cases of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to rise. A statement from the company quoted the Managing Director of SBC, Mr Ziad Maalouf, as saying the items would also be used to cater to patients and health workers at various isolation centres. He added that to help reduce misinformation and better protect the citizens across the country, the firm had allocated its media assets to help with the sensitisation of the public on what they could do to keep safe. He said, â€œAs cases of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to rise, Nigerians have had to battle with both the possibility of getting infected and the panic created by varying pieces of information being circulated.
