Dele Ogunyemi, Warri Deputy Speaker, Delta State House of Assembly, Christopher Ochor Ochor, has donated food items to orphanages and his constituents in Ukwuani Local Government Area. He presented the items to leaders of various communities through two of his aides, Mr. Emmanuel Enebeli, his Press Secretary and his Senior Special Assistant (Political), Moses Osemeke, who coordinated the distribution of the items including over 200 bags of rice, bags of beans, indomie noodles, canned tomatoes and tubers of yams among others.
