Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo One person was killed and another injured when hoodlums attacked residents of the Odemuyiwa village in the Ife South Local Government Area of Osun State and also clashed with the police. Policemen, who were responding to a distress call, reportedly engaged the hoodlums in an exchange of gunfire on Friday. The cops were said to have seized three motorcycles from the hoodlums, who sometime in February this year, allegedly attacked the palace of the Baale of Odemuyiwa. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, confirmed the incident. She said the state Commissioner of Police, Johnson Kokumo, had given directive that other fleeing hoodlums involved in the attack should be apprehended. According to her, some of the items recovered from the hoodlums include one locally-made single-barrelled gun, machete, charms and three motorcycles. Opalola said, “Around 6am on Friday, a group of armed arsonists, who were attacking Odemuyiwa village, engaged in a shootout with police personnel who were responding to a distress call from the traditional ruler of Odemuyiwa village. “Consequently, two of the attackers were wounded. One died on the way to hospital and his corpse has been deposited in the morgue of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife. “The second, 44-year-old Timothy Elugbindin, from Ile-Ife, is receiving treatment at the Police Hospital, Osogbo. The suspects had been under security watch for randomly terrorising the village. They set ablaze the palace of the Baale of Odemuyiwa over a chieftaincy dispute in the past.” Copyright PUNCH.
