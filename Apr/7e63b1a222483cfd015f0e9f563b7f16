Toni Ufoh arsenal rising star, Bukayo Saka, whose contract with the Gunners is yet to be extended, has come under scrutiny by Football London. The British-born Nigerian youngster’s contract expires in 2021. “Out of those whose contracts expire in 2021, (Saka), the 18-year-old probably stands as the player who Arsenal need to secure an extension for the most. Although losing Aubameyang would hurt greatly, failing to tie down Saka’s would be nothing short of a travesty,” Football London said. “The main drawback of losing Saka will no doubt be what he offers on a match day. Not just his quality on the ball but his application to ensure he gives his best possible performance wherever he’s playing. But if the Gunners cannot secure an extension for the 18-year-old, it will prove yet again, that they still need to learn from their mistakes. “If Saka – who has been linked with Borussia Dortmund – also chooses to leave for pastures new before he turns 20-years-old, this won’t only hurt Arsenal in the short-term.” “For Saka, Arsenal simply must come out on top. Not just to prove they can keep their best talent in the present day, but to send a message to youngsters following in Saka’s footsteps that they can succeed in north London,” it added. Saka, having represented England’s U-16, 17, 18 and 19s respectively, is eligible for the Super Eagles as he has parents of Nigerian descent. Copyright PUNCH.
