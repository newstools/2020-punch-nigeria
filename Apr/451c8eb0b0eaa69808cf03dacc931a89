Peter Dada, Akure Eighteen commercial sex workers have been arrested by the Ondo State Task Force on COVID-19 for violating the curfew imposed by the state government. Governor Rotimi Akeredolu had announced a dusk to dawn curfew as part of efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus disease. It was gathered that the violators were caught in a brothel at the Shasha area of Akure around 10.30pm on Sunday, while the task force was monitoring compliance with the government order. The suspects were said to have been placed in isolation and their samples taken to ascertain their COVID-19 status. It was also gathered that they would be in the isolation centre pending when their results would be out. Confirming the development, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Special Duties and Strategies, Dr Doyin Odebowale, said the women were caught in a brothel in defiance of the curfew. “We caught them around 10.30pm. “We have brought the medical team to come and take their samples. The brothel has been shut. We will invite the owner,” Odebowale urged residents of the state to always cooperate with the government by obeying instructions on how to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Copyright PUNCH.
