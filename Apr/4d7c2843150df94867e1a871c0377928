Kayode Oyero Fourth-time African Women’s Player of the Year, Asisat Oshoala, has advised everyone to maintain social distancing and obey government-ordered lockdowns in places affected by the coronavirus pandemic. In a 34-second video on Monday, Oshoala stressed that the lethal virus is real and thereby called on her fans and everyone to stay indoors to curb the circle of transmission of the virus which has infected over two million people globally. The Nigerian professional footballer, who plays for the Spanish side, FC Barcelona Femení in the Primera Division as a forward, cautioned that people should exercise within their localities but not risk the lives of others by mingling during the outbreak. She said, “My name is Asisat Oshoala. I just want to use this medium to let everyone know it’s not safe out there right now. I urge everyone to stay indoors, stay at home. “You want to work out, try to work out within your area. Stay indoors, don’t go outside. Just to save all the people’s lives and also not to put other people’s lives at risk as well. COVID-19 is real. Please stay indoors and stay safe everyone.” The PUNCH had reported earlier that Actress Funke Akindele also advised Nigerians to maintain social distancing and safe hygiene practices as part of measures to reduce the spread of the virus. World over, governments have placed lockdowns on affected parts of their countries to enforce social distancing and beat the virus. According to the World Health Organisation, the virus has killed no fewer than 150,000 people since it broke out some four months ago. Although no vaccine has been announced as the treatment or cure for the virus, the United Nations’ specialised body on global health continues to emphasise social distancing as an important way of reducing the spread of the infection.
