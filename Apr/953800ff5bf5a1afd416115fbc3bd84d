’Femi Asu The Oyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, has said his administration is ready to upgrade the Akufo Farm Settlement to an agricultural estate. Makinde said this during an on-the-spot inspection tour of the Akufo Farm Settlement, according to a statement issued by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Taiwo Adisa, on Monday. He said his administration was working round the clock to make commercial agriculture the backbone of the state’s economy by upgrading some farm settlements in the state to agricultural estates. The governor said, “Agriculture is where we think we have comparative advantage, and we are looking at agro-processing to expand our economy. This place used to be a farm settlement but we are upgrading it to a farm estate. “People are already here; so, we came to find out first-hand what is really going on here and how things can be done meaningfully in a way that can drive the economic expansion agenda of our government.” Makinde said the state government was ready to partner with the private sector to expand the economy of the state in line with one of the four cardinal points of his administration’s service agenda. He also said his administration would incorporate other stakeholders to harness the benefits for the local market and export. Copyright PUNCH.
