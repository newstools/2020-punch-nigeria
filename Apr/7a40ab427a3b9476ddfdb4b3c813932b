‘Tosin Oluwalowo English Premier League side Arsenal have joined the race for Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen. According to French outlet Le Quotidien du Foot, Arsenal have joined other Premier League clubs Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester United, who are also reportedly interested in the Nigerian. The 21-year-old has been in top form for Lille since joining the French side in the summer from German side Wolfsburg, and Arsenal are looking at using him to replace captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Aubameayang’s present contract with Arsenal is due to expire in 2021 and the club has not opened contract talks with the Gabonese. Aubameyang has also courted interest from Barcelona, Real Madrid and Inter Milan and Arsenal might be forced to sell him to avoid losing him on a free transfer. If he joins Arsenal, Osimhen will be the third Super Eagles player after Nwankwo Kanu and Alex Iwobi to play for the club. Osimhen has 18 goals in 38 appearances for Lille this season.
