Tony Okafor, Awka The Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, on Sunday tackled  those who criticised measures he had taken on coronavirus in the state. Comparing them to “mass murderers and genocide perpetrators,” the governor said he would remain focused and ensure that the pandemic did not spread into the state. In a statement on Sunday by the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr C-Don Adinuba, Obiano said, “Those who are hell-bent on politicising a pandemic which puts the lives of millions of our people at grave risk are no different from those who commit mass murder and genocide.” He accused the politicians of refusing to contribute to the coffers of the state government or the Federal Government’s in the fight against the virus, but  would attempt to demonise those who donated to the campaign. He thanked a former Central Bank Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, who had donated N10m to the Anambra State Fund on COVID-19. “They shut down their businesses in Lagos and Abuja so as to maintain social distancing for themselves and their staff members, but attempted to goad traders in Anambra State to resist the market closure,” the governor added.
