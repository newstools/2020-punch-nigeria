Samuel Awoyinfa The Organised Private Sector in Nigeria through an initiative tagged Coalition Against COVID-19 has donated over N21bn to support government’s efforts to tackle the pandemic in the country. This was disclosed by a business mogul, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, on the occasion of his 63rd birthday, which is today (Friday). In a statement made available to our correspondent, the richest man in Africa assured Nigerians that ultimately Nigeria and Africa as a whole would record victory over the deadly virus. Dangote, who through his philanthropic organisation, Aliko Dangote Foundation, donated N2bn in cash and other materials to the CACOVID Fund, commended the efforts of the government at all levels and those on the front line of the fight against COVID-19, ravaging the economic, health and social sectors of the country. In the message issued by the Dangote Group’s Chief Corporate Communications Officer, Mr Anthony Chiejina, Dangote said all hands must be on deck to fight the coronavirus pandemic. It stated, “Every gesture of support from other stakeholders outside government and the business community in Nigeria and Africa would go a long way to help tackle an issue which has assumed a global dimension, with its impact felt all over the world. If we all work together to combat this virus, then there is light at the end of the tunnel.” Dangote and the Central Bank of Nigeria are the biggest donors to the Coalition Against Covid-19 account domiciled in the CBN.
