Ebenezer Bajela Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, has debunked claims that he influenced teammate Kelechi Iheancho’s move to the King Power Stadium after he quit Manchester City for more game time. Iheanacho joined the Foxes after two seasons playing at the Etihad Stadium where he made 46 appearances and scored 12 goals. Speaking on Instagram Live with ng_supereagles, Ndidi said, “No, I don’t think so. Myself and Kelechi are cool but I never influenced his move.” He added that he had never had close friends since his move to Leicester. “I don’t have any best friend at Leicester City but I have always been cool with Iheanacho.” However, the midfielder refused to comment when asked which football club he supported as a kid but his response had people thinking he had a soft spot for London giants Chelsea. “Growing up, I always admired Mikel,” Ndidi said.
