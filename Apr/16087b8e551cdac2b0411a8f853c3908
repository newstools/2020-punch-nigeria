Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt The Rivers State Government on Thursday arrested 22 traders, who were brought into the state in a container fitted to a truck. Our correspondent learnt that the traders were entering the state from Abia State. The traders said they were from Anambra and Abia states, but conduct their business in Rivers State. The Rivers State Health Commissioner, Prof. Chike Princewill, said the 22 traders would be screened to ascertain their coronavirus status. He said the screening was vital to ensure that they did not infect people of the state. He said, “After screening, the traders will be tried in line with the extant laws in place to protect Rivers people.” Copyright PUNCH.
