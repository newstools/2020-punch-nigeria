Nike Popoola Zenith Bank Plc says it has introduced an automated voice banking service, an interactive voice response solution which enables customers to perform basic banking transactions by dialling a dedicated phone line through their registered phone numbers and following the prompts. Speaking on the launch of the product, the Group Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ebenezer Onyeagwu, said that the “Zenith automated voice banking service is designed to ensure a truly amazing experience that will offer convenience for our teeming customers.” He added that the self-service product would offer quick response to customers in addition to security entrenched by the multilayer authentication mechanism. He urged the bank’s customers to take advantage of the unique service particularly at this critical time when the physical interface with the bank had been adversely impacted due to social distancing, and the restriction of movement in some states due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Zenith Bank stated that it had clearly distinguished itself in the Nigerian financial services industry through superior service quality, unique customer experience and sound financial indices. “The bank remains a clear leader in the digital space with several firsts in the deployment of innovative products, solutions and alternative channels that ensure convenience, speed and safety of transactions,” it stated.
