Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, has mourned the death  of a member of his cabinet, Markus Senlo, who was until his death in the early hours of Monday the Commissioner for Rural Development. Ishaku in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Bala Dan-Abu, said the news of the sudden and untimely death of Senlo shocked him. Ishaku described the late Senlo as a grass roots politician and a loyal party man. “He was an asset to our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party. As a member of the State Executive Council, he made very useful contributions to debates, especially in areas that had to do with the extension of amenities to the rural populace. “His death at this time has left a big gap that will be difficult to fill.” The governor expressed deep sympathy to the family of the late Senlo and the entire people of the Zing Local Government Area for what he described as a sad and unfortunate development.
