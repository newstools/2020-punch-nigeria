Oladimeji Ramon The Ajia Balogun Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oloye Adegboyega Adegoke, has said it is unrealistic that Nigerians will obey the government’s stay-at-order if they have not received any palliative from government. He said faced with hunger, people who live on daily earnings would find it difficult to comply with the government’s stay-at-home order. To encourage compliance, Adegoke called for effectiveness in the manner government’s palliatives were being distributed to ensure they reach the targeted vulnerable citizens. He made the call while giving out cash to widows across six local governments areas in Ibadan, according to a statement on Tuesday. The statement said each of the 120 widows received N5,000. Adegoke said, “The only way to ensure that people stay at home is to provide palliatives for them. To ensure that this coronavirus does not spread among our people, we have to ensure that we give them what they will use to stay at home.

If government fails to give palliatives to the people, they will not stay at home; but if they are given what they will use to stay at home, they will comply. “We need to stop the spread of coronavirus, that is why it is compulsory to give palliatives to the people before we can stop them from going out.” Copyright PUNCH.
