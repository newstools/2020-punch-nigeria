Chima Azubuike, Gombe The Secretary of the Kumo East Ward of the All Progressives Congress in Gombe State, Shuaibu Adamu, along with 19 other members of the executive, have distanced themselves from the purported dismissal of the member representing Akko Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Usman Kumo. The APC ward chairman, Musa Barade, had last week expelled the Rep member citing anti-party activities as his offence. Adamu, who spoke during a press briefing organised by the ward executives at the state party secretariat in Gombe, said, “Some unscrupulous elements in the party forged our signatures and expelled Usman Kumo from the party. This was done without our knowledge. “For this damage of reputation and credibility, we therefore suspend Musa Barade as the APC chairman, Kumo East Ward, for six months with effect from today April 2, 2020.” Copyright PUNCH.
