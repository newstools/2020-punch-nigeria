’Femi Asu A total of 60 Nigerian crude oil cargoes have not been sold despite the reduction of the official selling prices by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. A glut of Nigerian and Angolan crude weighed on the market on Tuesday with demand from China slower than in the last few weeks, Reuters reports. “It’s a buyer’s market right now,” one trader was quoted as saying, adding that nothing was shifting. According to Reuters, the glut of unsold Nigerian oil was around 60 cargoes for April and May, and cargoes of Qua Iboe and Bonny Light crude continued to be offered at around dated Brent minus $3. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation was reported in March to have cut its April official selling prices for Bonny Light and Qua Iboe, two of the nation’s major grades, by $5 per barrel to dated Brent minus $3.29 and minus $3.10 per barrel, respectively.
