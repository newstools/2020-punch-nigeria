Ebenezer Bajela Ex-Super Eagles striker, Ikechukwu Uche, has urged Samuel Chukuweze to shun offers from the English Premier League and remain with Villarreal to continue his development. Chukwueze has been severally linked with Chelsea and Liverpool following his impressive displays for the Yellow Submarines since he broke into the first team last season. The 20-year-old has scored eight goals in 52 matches for Villarreal since he made his debut for the senior team in 2018. But he’s been told by Uche to remain at his Spanish club saying that the youngster will get better in La Liga. In an interview with Nigeria Info monitored by our correspondent, Uche, who spent 13 years playing in Spain, said, “He (Chukwueze) is very good; everything is working very fast for him. He’s doing well, he’s growing. “With the games he’s been playing, it shows he can get better. Where he is, it is obvious that he would get better. “He would do well because they are one of the best teams at the moment in the Spanish league. “They’ve had important players and like bringing up players from the second team and make them stars. “He’s doing well, he’s growing. With the games he’s been playing it shows he can get better.” Uche, 36, despite a bright career in Spain, did not play in the Premier League, but the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations winner said he had no regrets not playing in England. “No, even though I had one or two offers back then. I cannot really go into details, but I can remember I had offers from there but it didn’t work out. “When you play football, you get offers from everywhere, so if it didn’t work out it means it wasn’t real.” Copyright PUNCH.
