John Charles, Makurdi Some suspected herdsmen on Monday invaded Tse Vambe community in Mbawa ward of the Guma Local Government Area of Benue State and beheaded one farmer while several others were injured. This is coming barely one week after suspected herdsmen attacked and beheaded two young men in the Agatu LGA of the state. According to a source, the suspected herdsmen attacked the community around 2.30pm on Monday. He explained that the victim was on his farm clearing bush when the herdsmen captured him and later beheaded him before they proceeded to the village, shooting indiscriminately and setting houses on fire. “Shooting is still going on at Tse Vambe. One person was  killed and beheaded while three others who  were in the farm are still missing “People have deserted the area and have run to Daudu to take refuge. The whereabouts of those people captured is still unknown.” When contacted, the Force Commander, Operation Whirl Stroke, Maj. Gen. Adeyemi Yekini, said he was not aware of the attack, adding that his troops in the Guma LGA were patrolling the areas. Copyright PUNCH.
