Nike Popoola Unitrust Insurance says it has provided alternative communication lines for business continuity aside from its self-service website. The company said this was in view of the escalating health concerns relating to COVID-19 outbreak and the restriction of movements by the governments. A statement said aside from its self-service website, it had closely been monitoring developments, especially as it concerned the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. The company said it was conscious of the complexities and challenges the pandemic virus posed. Unitrust  said as the government was putting in measures to further prevent the spread of this pandemic, and as the World Health Organisation and Federal Ministry of Health were taking necessary steps, it had also been proactive to protect its clients , employees and their families. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officers, Mr John Ijerheime, said the company remained very accessible through its e-commerce site and its e-portals for motor third party, travels insurance, which could be purchased and renewed seamlessly. “We urge our staff and clients to keep safe by maintaining good hygiene and observing all directives given by the health authorities,” he stated.
