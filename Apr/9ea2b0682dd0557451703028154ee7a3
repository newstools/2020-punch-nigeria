Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, on Tuesday, ordered an investigation into the alleged invasion of some villages in the Akure North Local Government Area of the state by Fulani herdsmen. The affected villages are Adejubu, Adewole, Olotin, Olondan and Jojo. Many houses were allegedly burnt by the herders, but no life was lost in the alleged attack, which reportedly occurred on Sunday. Speaking on the development on Tuesday, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Security Matters, Alhaji Jimoh Dojumo, said Akeredolu had ordered a full-scale investigation into the incident. According to him, all parties concerned in the matter have been invited to the governor’s office in Akure in a bid to resolve the crisis. “I led the team of security men to the villages to see the level of things and we have invited all the parties to Akure on the orders of the governor. So, the issue will be resolved,” Dojumo stated. He promised that the state government would do its best to unravel the cause(s) of the incident so that the parties involved could be reconciled in due course. The state Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Phillip Ayuba, also expressed the readiness of the Agro Rangers Squad of the NSCDC to provide adequate security and to mediate between farmers and herders in the state. The state Commissioner of Police, Mr Undie Adie, accused the villagers of raising a false alarm, adding that there was no crisis. “When we got the information, our men quickly moved to the villages, only to get there and discovered that it was a false alarm. We did not find out about any crisis there,” the CP stated. Copyright PUNCH.
