Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Nigeria Union of Pensioners, Ogun State chapter, has urged the state governor, Dapo Abiodun, to pay its members N10,000 each so as to cushion the effect of the lockdown on the senior citizens in the state. The pensioners stated this on Monday in a release by the state secretary,  Bola Lawal. Lawal lamented that members in the state were currently faced with different untold hardships during the COVID-19 lockdown currently going on in the state. Lawal further complained that the money they received as   pensioners was not enough to feed for three days. He stressed that there was the need for the government to pay N10,000 into each pensioner’s account as a means of palliative to soothe the pain of the lockdown on them. The NUP, however, urged the government to give five trailer loads of food items to the pensioners out of the 100 trailers that would be sent by the Federal Government. He said, “Nigeria Union of Pensioners, Ogun State council wishes to express the untold hardship experienced by the pensioners of Ogun State as a result of COVID-19 lockdown. “Most of these pensioners earn N5,000 and below as monthly pension.  This amount cannot carry them for three days as food allowances. How then do we expect them to survive the 14 days lockdown without food? “In view of the above, NUP calls on Ogun State governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, to pay N10,000 into each pensioner’s accounts as a means of palliative to soothe the pain of the lockdown. “It would be appreciated if Ogun State pensioners are allowed five trailer loads of food items out of the 100 loads of food items sent by the Federal Government.” Copyright PUNCH.
