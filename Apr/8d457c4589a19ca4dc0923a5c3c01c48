A reliable source at LASUTH said the patient was delivered of her baby at the Lagos State Government-owned Alimosho General Hospital. The source narrated that the woman had developed infections in the course of the childbirth, and was subsequently brought to LASUTH, also state-owned, where she was placed on admission for medical treatment. The reliable source confirmed to PUNCH HealthWise that the late patient’s result confirmed her COVID-19 status after she had passed on. The source, who preferred anonymity, said, “The result came out after she had died, but we had suspected after she came in.
