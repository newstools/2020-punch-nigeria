Matthew Ochei, Asaba The kidnapped Anglican priest from Issele-Mkpitime in the Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State, Rev. Anthony  Oyi, has regained his freedom. Oyi, who was abducted alongside his family members by gunmen alleged to be herdsmen on his farm on Saturday, was released by his abductors on Monday after the payment of over N600,000 as ransom. The abductors had released the priest’s wife and children after three hours, but kept Anthony and another man. The abductors had asked the wife to go and look for money to pay the ransom for the priest’s release. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, who confirmed the release of the priest, said she was not aware if ransom was paid. “Yes, the priest was released on Monday around 6pm, but I don’t know whether the family paid ransom; maybe they paid, but it didn’t reflect in the situation report that I got. But they said the man was seriously beaten, so he is receiving treatment in hospital,” Onovwakpoyeya stated. She added that the police were making efforts to arrest the abductors. But a family source told our correspondent that over N600,000 was paid to secure Anthony’s release. Copyright PUNCH.
