The Nigeria Labour Congress on Friday said it was opposed to the use of contributory pension as palliatives for workers as part of the move to cushion the effect of the coronavirus lockdown in the country. NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, said this while fielding questions from newsmen at the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 daily press briefing in Abuja. This was sequel to a question posed to the NLC President if the contributory pension could be used as palliatives as the lockdown entered the fourth week in Abuja as well as Lagos and Ogun States.

Wabba, however, lauded the PTF members for the work they were doing to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that the chairman of PTF, Boss Mustapha, must be commended for the interface between the PTF and the NLC. He said the NLC would continue to be reasonable by engaging the government and the PTF while commending the frontline workers for their sacrifices to contain the virus. He added that the NLC had produced locally-made face masks, stating that it would be distributed free to some Nigerians. (NAN)
