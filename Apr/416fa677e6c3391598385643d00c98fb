Ife Ogunfuwa 9mobile on Tuesday announced free access to health and educational websites, including the National Open University, to its customers. The company said this service was aimed at mitigating the impact of the lockdown and restricted movements occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. The telecom company identified some of the educational pre-selected websites on this service as Schoolgate, Mobile Classroom (in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Education) National Open University, Khan Academy and Seesaw. It highlighted other health-related websites as Mobihealth, World Health Organisation, Nigeria Health Watch, HealthLine and Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, among others. 9mobile said access to these websites ensured that 9mobile customers and Nigerians remained connected and had more access to basic essential services which they required. Speaking on this contribution, the Executive Director, Regulatory and Corporate Affairs at 9mobile, Abdulrahman Ado, explained that health and education were two out of the three pillars of 9mobileâ€™s Corporate Social Responsibility programmes.
