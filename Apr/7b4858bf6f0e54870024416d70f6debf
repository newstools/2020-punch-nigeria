Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps has threatened to shut markets that are not complying with the social distancing rule. The Corps Marshal of the agency, Gbemisola Akinpelu, who stated this on Monday, said the social distancing measure was necessary to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Akinpelu urged traders to comply with the social distancing rule to avoid being sanctioned. According to her, the agency will continue to ensure that all markets in the state adhere strictly to the directive through advocacy campaigns and sensitisation. She said, “As a way of ensuring compliance with the social distancing order in markets, the Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps advises traders to ensure strict compliance with the order and defaulters will be appropriately sanctioned by the state government and the markets will be shut down as directed by the Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources. “Overcrowded areas such as our market places will help to increase the spread of this coronavirus pandemic if social distancing is not adhered to and this will pose a great danger to the efforts of the state government at combating the spread of the virus. “I want to urge the traders to maintain cleanliness around the markets and stop trading on road setbacks and drainages, and engage in regular hand-washing with soap and water as well as regular use of hand sanitizers and face mask.” Akinpelu urged persons, who had no business in the markets, to stay away in order to reduce the numbers of people in the markets.
