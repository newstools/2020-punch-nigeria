Olufemi Atoyebi, Abuja The Nigeria Medical Association on Friday called on some state governments not to place religious consideration above public health issues in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement signed by the president of the association, Dr Francis Faduyile, and the secretary-general, Dr Olumuyiwa Odustote, NMA called on states not to relax the lockdown measure because of Easter celebration or Jumaat service. The statement said, “The attention of the Nigerian Medical Association has been drawn to some statements negating the established measure of preventing COVID-19 social distancing, and orders by some state governors authorising the mass observance of Jumat prayers and Easter Sunday services. “Of particular concern is the declaration by the Cross River State Governor that social distancing is not needed while wearing a face mask; a moratorium on the lockdown to allow mass gathering in mosques and churches starting from Friday to Sunday in Rivers State, and the lifting of the ban on Friday prayers by Katsina and Kogi states government. “We are aware that similar orders have also been given in Ondo, Ebonyi and Imo states which have approved mass attendance of Easter services.” NMA warned that with more community transmission of COVID-19 being reported in the country, it was vital to eschew any measure that would promote mass gathering. It added, “While appreciating the prime place of religion in our national lives and especially the value Christians place on Easter, we place on record that there is now the evidence of community transmission of COVID-19. “As such, relaxing any guideline that promotes mass gatherings in any part of our nation now can only heighten and not flatten the curve of transmission dynamics. “We, therefore, pray all authorities concerned to rescind their decision in the interest of the safety of lives and implore the Nigerian Police force and other security agencies to ensure that such gatherings do not take place.”
