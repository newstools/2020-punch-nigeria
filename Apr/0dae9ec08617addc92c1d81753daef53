Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt TRADITIONAL rulers in Rivers State have called on the Federal Government to ensure that no zone was marginalised in the ongoing distribution of palliatives meant to cushion the adverse effects COVID-19 across the country. The Chairman, Rivers State Council of Traditional Rulers, His Majesty, Amanyanabo of Opobo, King Douglas Jaja, who made this call in Port Harcourt on Saturday after the traditional rulers’ meeting, said the call was necessary to make sure that no zone would feel cheated or marginalised. He said, “The Federal Government should make sure that no zone is marginalised. Equity should be considered in the distribution of grants and other things as palliatives, so that no one will feel cheated in the entire scenario. “The fight against COVID-19 is a fight that everybody is involved in. COVID-19 does not choose where it goes; everybody is involved. Therefore, the Federal Government should treat people as equal because all of us; both the big and the small, can suffer from it.” In a communiqué signed by the monarchs after the traditional rulers’ meeting, the traditional rulers demanded that the Federal Government should support Rivers State and the South-South zone .
