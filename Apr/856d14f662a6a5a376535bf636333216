Johnson Okafor Wema Bank Plc has launched a self-service banking platform for its customers. According to a statement by the bank, the new banking feature, which is hosted on the bank’s digital platform, ALAT, uses an Interactive Voice Response to generate information for customers and from help them perform other banking needs. Customers, it stated, could confirm account balance, resolve account security issues and check their financial statements in varying period stretches. Issues around failed, delayed or non-reflecting transactions, app sign-up and login issues and other account-related matters could also be resolved using the platform, it added. Managing Director and CEO, Wema Bank, Ademola Adebise, said, “This in no way should impale on customer’s ability to carry out their banking transactions. “With the launch of ALAT in 2017 being a solution to a problem of the future, it seems that that future is now.” The bank recently noted that its ALAT was supporting salary earners with instant loans. ALAT salary-based loan is a low-interest loan available to the bank’s existing as well as new salary-earning customers who may or may not have their salary account domiciled with Wema Bank. The bank in a statement made available to newsmen said riding on its reputation of offering seamless financial services, ALAT customers would be able to access the salary-based loan without any form of paperwork, using their ALAT app or the ALAT web page without any collateral. Salary earners will be able to receive a minimum of N50,000 and up to N4,000,000 within hours and will have between three to 24 months to pay back with only two per cent interest rate per month on a reducing balance basis.
