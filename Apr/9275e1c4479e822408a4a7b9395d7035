Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has endorsed Joe Biden for US president in a video statement released Monday. “Today I am proud to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States because he will be an extraordinary president,” the speaker of the House of Representatives said in the pre-recorded message. Pelosi had ripped up her copy of Donald Trump’s State of the Union address in February, in a pointed political gesture after listening tight-lipped to the president tout his achievements to Congress.
