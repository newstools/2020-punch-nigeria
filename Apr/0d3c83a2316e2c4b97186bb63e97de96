Wale Oyewale, Ibadan Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has expressed his readiness to donate his blood as a sample for research in a bid to find a cure to the COVID-19 pandemic. Where necessary, he said his blood could be taken for evaluation by experts on post infection protection against the deadly viral infection. Makinde, who is a survivor of COVID-19, indicated his intention on Wednesday via his official Twitter account. He wrote, “We have been advocating for local solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic in Oyo State. So, as a COVID-19 survivor, I volunteered to donate my blood to be studied by our experts researching on the ‘Evaluation of Post Infection Protection Against SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) in Nigeria.” Shorty after testing negative to the virus after the initial test that came positive, the governor advocated local solutions to the COVID-19. Makinde had said, “We are looking at local solutions. I know that a lot of people have been calling me all sorts of names on the social media but, from my experience, one thing that I know you have to do to conquer the virus is that you have to boost your immunity. We do have local solutions and, of course, we have to defer to experts’ opinion as part of the home-grown solution to deal with COVID-19. Copyright PUNCH.
