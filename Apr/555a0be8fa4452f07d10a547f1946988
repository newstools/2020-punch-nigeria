Toni Ufoh Super Eagles invitee, Cyriel Dessers, said he is not sure of his next destination as the supposed big clubs no longer have the budget it takes due to the suspension of leagues. The Belgian-born Nigerian emerged joint top scorer in the just-cancelled Eredivisie season with 15 goals, five assists in 25 appearances for Heracles Almelo. Dessers, following in his superb performance for the Zeus, has been a subject of a transfer away from the Eredivisie. The former   NAC Breda striker told TC Tubantia, “I think next summer is the worst time to make a transfer in about a hundred years. “That is a strange feeling. The big clubs that were interested no longer have the budget to spend a lot on new players. “I don’t expect a bid or club like this to be the case last January, I cannot help but wait and that’s fine. I’m not in control. Nobody saw this coming, life intervened,” he said. Dessers is currently valued €3.2m by Transfer market. Copyright PUNCH.
