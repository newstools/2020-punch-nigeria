Anna Okon A group, the Council of Managing Directors of Customs Licensed Agents, has lamented the inability of clearing agents in the country to get to the seaports owing to lack of public transportation. The group equally noted that port operations had remained skeletal four weeks after the lockdown due to minimal bank and seaport terminal services. The National President, MDCLA, Mr Lucky Amiwero, stated this in a letter made available to our correspondent on Monday. He said, “Majority of Customs agents are still at home due to their inability to access the ports from their various homes as a result of non-availability of public transportation. “Also, port operations are still skeletal till date.” Recall that the NPA had directed the ports to remain open as the lockdown went into force.
