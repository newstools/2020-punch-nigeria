Wale Oyewale, Ibadan An Ibadan-based social-cultural group, Ibadan Mesi Ogo, has faulted the decision of the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, to hand over the coordination of the state COVID-19 task force to the former Chief Medical Director, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Prof. Temitope Alonge. The governor, who chaired the task force, relinquished the position shortly after testing positive to coronavirus. The group, in a statement by its President, Dr Jide Oriolowo, and Secretary, Adetunji Maroof, said the governor’s decision violated the ethics of the medical profession. The statement read in part, “The decision of the governor to hand over the coordination of COVID-19 activities to the former CMD of UCH is an aberration. Prof. Alonge is a specialist in orthopedics; hence, he is not fit for the purpose. “There are many professors of virology in the UCH who should be saddled with such huge tasks. The appointment of Alonge doesn’t conform with the modern practice of medicine. A virologist who specialises in the control, prevention and eradication of diseases should have been appointed by the governor.” According to the group, the governor should, as a matter of public importance, rescind his decision and appoint a virologist to head the state task force on COVID-19.
