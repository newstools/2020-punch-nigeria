JUSTIN TYOPUUSU The Speaker of the Taraba State House of Assembly, Dr Joseph Kunini, on Saturday, urged security agencies in the state to commence full investigation into the recent attack on Shomoh in the Lau Local Government Area of the state. Shomoh communities on Easter Sunday came under attack by suspected Jole militia, leading to the death of over 18 persons. Kunini made the call when he visited the affected communities to condole with the people and access the level of damage caused by the attack. The speaker, who condemned the attack, stressed that available evidence suggested that the perpetrators would not be difficult to unmask. He told security agencies that the crisis had drawn the attention of the Federal Government, pointing out that President Muhammadu Buhari also showed concern over the killings. “It will amount to an act of irresponsibility if the perpetrators are allowed to go unpunished,” he said. He emphasised that quick apprehension of the culprit would give the victims some sense of justice and avoid the possibility of reprisal which could cause more deaths and destruction. Kunini commended the people of the area for not resorting to self-help, assuring them of government commitment to ameliorate their plight. Some of the victims, who spoke to journalists, said that the crisis had brought untold hardship on them. Copyright PUNCH.
