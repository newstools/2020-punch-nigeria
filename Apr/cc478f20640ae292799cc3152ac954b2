Raphael Ede, Enugu A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Adaku Ogbu-Aguocha, has condemned what she described as continuous attacks on the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, by the leadership of the party in Enugu State. The Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Unit, had on Friday arrested the APC Youth Leader in Enugu West Senatorial Zone, Mr Nwanjoku Okugo, over a social media post alleging that the minister had tested positive for coronavirus, and, instead of quarantining himself, proceeded to Enugu. Following the development, the Enugu State APC Chairman, Dr Ben Nwoye, addressed journalists, accusing the minister of using his office to harass and intimidate party members in the state. Reacting to the verbal attack on the minister, Ogbu-Aguocha, who was the Enugu East senatorial candidate of the APC in the 2019 general elections, absolved him of blame. In a statement on Sunday, she said Okugo’s arrest followed a petition by a party chieftain to the Inspector-General of Police. Ogbu-Aguocha said, “People cannot, under the cover of social media, maliciously concoct and spread fictitious stories to malign the image and integrity of our leaders, then turn around to cry intimidation. Mr Nwanjoku and his sponsors should face the consequences of their fake news peddling and leave Mr Onyeama out of it.” Another APC chieftain in the state, Ambassador Ginika Tor, claimed that Okugo was being sponsored to scandalise Onyeama. Tor, who described the social media post as shameful, said, “This is the height of irresponsibility. Definitely, we cannot continue to look the other way, while our leader’s name and reputation is constantly tarnished.” Copyright PUNCH.
