Samuel Awoyinfa One of the home-grown retail outlets, Justrite Super Stores, has made a donation of truckloads of noodles and Golden Morn as palliatives to Lagos and Ogun state governments. In Lagos, it donated a total of 800 cartons of Indomie, and 100 cartons of Golden Morn. In Ogun, it donated 400 cartons of Indomie and 50 cartons of Golden Morn to the state government. While delivering the food products in Lagos, the Chairman, Justrite Super Stores, Ayo Aderinwale, said, “We have a situation where the world is facing an unusual challenge, particularly in Nigeria. “We as a company came out to see how we can support the efforts of the government in reaching out to Nigerians, mostly residents of Lagos State, because of the impact of the pandemic on the state.” While receiving the items on behalf of the state government, the Lagos State Director, Ministry of Agriculture, Omirin Adeyinka, said the gesture was a wonderful development, seeing individuals coming out to support the government in a time like this. While handing over the donations to the Ogun State Government, the Assistant General Manager of the company, Kadiri Agboola, said the gesture was to give back to the society. Agboola added that the company donated the food items to the government so as to cushion the effects of the lockdown on the state. According to him, the organisation has taken the community into consideration and “if you even actually look at what we do, it is service to the people.” The company, according to Aderinwale, also operates WhatsApp ordering system where consumers can make orders via WhatsApp and the company will have the goods delivered to them.
