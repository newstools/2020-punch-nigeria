John Alechenu, Abuja Indigenes of Ebonyi State in the diaspora have urged the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party to caution Governor Dave Umahi over his growing tilt towards dictatorship. The indigenes, under the aegis of the Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora, made the call in Abuja on Monday. They spoke against the backdrop of the governor’s recent ban on two journalists working in Ebonyi State. Chairman of the group, Pascal Oluchukwu, said the PDP had a duty to caution the Ebonyi State governor against what he described as “undemocratic practices and ensure that his actions, on behalf of the party, do not undermine its enviable democratic credentials.” Oluchukwu added, “The recent disgraceful and most unwarranted ban placed on two journalists covering Ebonyi State for Vanguard and The Sun newspapers respectively, is not ideal of a democratic party which the PDP represents. “The journalists were punished, not because of their incompetence, but because they have demonstrated independent reasoning and have refused to be corrupted or intimidated on the discharge of their duties. “The PDP needs to caution Governor Dave Umahi against making unguarded and careless utterances capable of undermining the democratic gains of the party in the state.” The group urged the PDP national leadership to rise up to the challenges and rein in the governor.
