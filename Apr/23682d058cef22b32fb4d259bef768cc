Sola Shittu Members of the Edo State House of Assembly have donated one-month salary to the Edo State Government to complement its fight against coronavirus. The Speaker of the House, Frank Okiye, disclosed this when he led other lawmakers to donate 200 bags of rice and 200 bags of beans to support the state government’s efforts at cushioning the economic effects of the pandemic on Edo people. In a statement in Benin on Wednesday, Okiye said government alone could not win the war against the pandemic as such it would require the support and collaboration of public-spirited Nigerians. He said, “We are aware of the reality on the ground; we are in a state of war against an invisible enemy and have decided to play our role by collaborating with the Edo State Government in ensuring that we win this fight.” Copyright PUNCH.
