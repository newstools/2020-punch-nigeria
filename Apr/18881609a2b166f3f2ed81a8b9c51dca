Tobi Aworinde, Abuja The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 has said the number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus would have been significantly higher without the lockdown order. The National Coordinator in the fight against COVID-19, Dr Sani Aliyu, who appeared on Sunday Politics, a live programme of Channels Television, noted that the it was important for people to observe the lockdown for as long as it is in effect. Aliyu said, “Some of the modeling studies we have done show that if we hadn’t put through the lockdown, we probably would have had much higher numbers. “Certainly, if you look at Europe and North America, the numbers doubles every three to four days and this is not what is happening in Nigeria. “So, to a certain extent, we are doing something right in this country. The numbers remain relatively low compared to the trend in other countries.” He also lauded those in states unaffected by restrictions who were also observing it. Copyright PUNCH.
