Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State, on Monday, launched the Federal Government’s conditional cash transfer to 25,000 households in the state. AbdulRasaq, who spoke during the commencement of the payment in Ilorin, said each beneficiary would get at least N20,000. He stated, “Today, I begin the disbursement of conditional cash transfer initiative of the Federal Government to 25,000 households in Kwara. Each benefiting household is to get N20,000 cumulatively for the months of January, February, March and April. “This is to assist the poor in this time of global pandemic when our people are asked to stay at home to halt the spread of the virus. I commend the Federal Government for increasing the number of beneficiaries in Kwara from 10,000 to 25,000. “I, especially, thank Mr President for this gesture as well as the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development for their efforts in coordinating these actions at this crucial time.” According to AbdulRasaq, the Federal Government’s initiative complements the measures taken by his administration to alleviate the consequences caused by the pandemic and the restriction of movement resulting from it. The governor added that he had proceeded into self-isolation shortly after returning from the National Economic Council meeting in Abuja on March 19, in full compliance with the safety protocols of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control on COVID-19. The Head of Unit of the National Cash Transfer Office, Hajia Amina Bagudu, noted that the payment to the beneficiaries gulped N550,405,000, including arrears.
