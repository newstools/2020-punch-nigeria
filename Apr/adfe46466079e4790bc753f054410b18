Ebenezer Bajela Plateau United coach, Abdu Maikaba, has said it will be okay if the table toppers are awarded the title if the season was not completed because of coronavirus. United are four points clear of second-place Rivers United, who have 45 points from 25 matches, but the league was suspended on March 18 because of the pandemic. Asked by The PUNCH about the prospect of United being awarded the title, Maikaba said, “I think it would be fair to hand us the NPFL title. “If you look at the number of match-days, out of the 25 match-days we have been on top of the log for 21 match-days. So, I think we really deserve to be given the trophy as the winner of the league peradventure things continue like this. Though, we don’t pray for that because we want the league to finish so that we can make sure that we satisfy ourselves as the real champions of the 2019/2020 seasons. “I believe we will finish and remain consistent because from the beginning of the season, we have been able to keep the distance between us and the second-place team to at least two points, but at the moment we have been able to extend the gap to four points, which I believe shows a clear sign of improvement moving towards the end of the competition.” On how the other coaches in the NPFL would react if United were to be handed the trophy, the 55-year-old said, “Whether they are happy or not, I believed we started this competition together and we have shown that sign of consistency from Day 1 up to Day 25. “I believe the other teams will not show any sign of unhappiness if the title is given to us, instead we will all celebrate it together and forge on.” Copyright PUNCH.
