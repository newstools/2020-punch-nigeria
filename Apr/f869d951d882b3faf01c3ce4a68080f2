Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Some suspected sea robbers have attacked a passenger boat in Bayelsa State. It was gathered that the incident happened on Saturday near Okoroma Creek around the Akassa-Brass-Yenagoa sea route. The boat driver was said to have escaped with some passengers while a few others fell into the water amidst the panic created by sporadic shooting by the hoodlums. It was learnt that one of the victims, a health worker, who was returning from a COVID-19 sensitisation campaign in the Brass Local Government Area, sustained bullet wounds in the attack. Another passenger, Mr Enoch Iduate, said he stayed in water for about 45 minutes before getting help from security operatives as the driver of the boat managed to escape with other travellers. Iduate, who is currently recuperating in one of the hospitals in Yenagoa, said he was hit by two bullets, one on his right shoulder and the other on his left arm. He appealed to the government to beef up security along the axis. He said, “The issue of robbers’ attacks in Bayelsa State is quite alarming. I really want the state government and the security agencies to put measures in place to curtail it. For us to travel, we have to pray very well, carry anointing oil. They (the sea robbers) lay ambush, target the driver and go away with the boat and all your belongings. People are scared to go to their villages.” The spokesman for the police in the state, Mr Asinim Butswat, said the state police command had yet to receive the report of the incident. Copyright PUNCH.
