’Tosin Oluwalowo Manchester United legend,  Andy Cole, has hailed ex-Super Eagles forward, Odion Ighalo, for his contributions since joining the club. Ighalo moved to United on a six-month loan deal from Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua during the January transfer window. Since his return to the English Premier League, the former Watford forward has been in good form, scoring four goals in eight appearances. This has caught the attention of Cole, who scored 93 goals in his six years spell with United, praising the Nigerian for fitting in perfectly. Speaking in a Striker’s Master Class featuring himself and Ighalo on Manchester United’s Youtube page, the ex-England international said, “I am really pleased with him. When you come to a club like Manchester United as a centre forward, everyone expects you to score straightaway, but it takes a little bit of time.” “And like Odion said himself, he wasn’t fit and was just coming in from pre-season in China, so, his coming in. “I think he has done pretty well  when he has been given the opportunity, he has applied himself really well in the club and has scored four good goals, four centre forward goals, you can’t ask for much more,” the 48 year-old said.
