Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo The Speaker of the Taraba State House of Assembly, Dr Joseph Albasu-Kunini, on Wednesday condemned the attack on Shomoh Sarki village in the Lau Local Government Area of the state by suspected Jole militia. The attack led to the death of over 18 persons and destruction of property. Kunini in an interview with journalists in Jalingo said it was barbaric and highly insensitive for any group of persons to take up arms against another group. The Jole militia had allegedly invaded the Shomoh Sarki village in the early hours of Sunday, killing and maiming the villagers as some drowned after jumping into River Benue. “I feel highly saddened by the event of Easter Sunday night, where some militia attacked the Shomoh village and killed several persons before destroying the whole village. “The cruelty of this attack is further worsened by the timing which is coming when the whole world is battling to contain the global pandemic of COVID-19. “At this point, we are supposed to be our brothers’ keepers and to work for the common good rather than taking up arms against one another,” he said.
