Kayode Oyero A policeman in the Okota axis of the Oshodi/Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State has been arrested for taking bribe from a motorist. The inspector, whose name tag gave away in the video as ‘Taloju Martins’, was seen to be counting N1000 notes said to be 40 pieces. The money was a ‘ransom’ paid by an unidentified motorist to free his vehicle. The motorist had allegedly violated the lockdown order of the government to curb the community transmission of coronavirus in the nation’s commercial capital. The motorist, whose car was seized by the police, was told to pay N50,000 but he pleaded to pay N40,000. But unknown to Martins, the motorist recorded the transaction. In the video posted by @RuggedyBaba, a Nigerian entertainer, the incident happened on Friday, April 10 at Ago Palace Road Okota. Confirming the incident, Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, told our correspondent over the phone that the culprit has been arrested. He added that the inspector would be subjected to disciplinary proceedings in accordance with the regulations of the Nigeria Police Force. “We have seen the video and the inspector has been arrested.
