Oladimeji Ramon The Minister of Youths and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has pledged support for a 27-year-old man, Jerry Mallo, who designed a no-contact handwashing and sanitising machine. The dual-purpose machine is operated with the legs, according to a statement on Thursday. Dare received Mallo in Abuja and alongside members of the National Youth Service Corps who designed face masks and produced hand sanitisers to support the battle against coronavirus. The minister said, “This is a very symbolic occasion as these youths have come up with innovations in the fight against the COVID-19 scourge. Their response in partnering with the ministry would go a long way to curtail the spread of the virus. “Mass production of these products will further help to achieve government’s aim of job creation. “The ministry will support Bennie to build capacity to train youths in welding and fabrication at our youth centres across the geopolitical zones. “The ministry will work with the government to explore how we can empower them to produce more so as to reach out to our teeming populace. We are excited as we promote local content from the Nigerian youth.” The Director-General of the NYSC, Brig. Gen. Ibrahim Shaibu, who presented corpers that produced the face masks and hand sanitisers to the minister, said they could produce 12,000 face masks; and 15,000 bottles of hand sanitisers in a day. The Minister of State for Labour and Productivity, Festus Keyamo, commended Dare for encouraging the youths. Copyright PUNCH.
