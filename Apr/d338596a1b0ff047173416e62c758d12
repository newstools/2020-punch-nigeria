Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Government on Thursday disclosed plans to reorder the 2020 N1.168tn budget following current economic challenges as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. The Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Mr Sam Egube; and Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, said this during an inter-ministerial press briefing in Alausa, Ikeja on Thursday. Other commissioners present at the event were Finance, Rabiu Olowo, Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello, Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, Agriculture, Gbolahan Lawal, Home Affairs, Anofiu Elegushi, Local Government and Community Affairs, Wale Ahmed, among others. Egube said the reordering became necessary in view of the slump in world oil price as well as the reduction in Internally Generated Revenue of the state. He said, “We are working assiduously, to review the budget to refocus, reorder and take into consideration the current challenges. We need to do this to give us the best chance of stimulating the economy and ensuring that the post-COVID-19 response economy will be strong, and enduring. Omotoso said the Presidential lockdown directive in the state was still in force, saying Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had not relaxed the directive. The commissioner was reacting to a trending story on the social media that the governor had lifted the ongoing restriction of movement for Good Friday, from 8am to 4pm in the state. According to Omotoso, “The lockdown is still on. Governor Sanwo-Olu has always reiterated that only President Muhammadu Buhari can only give any order if it is going to be relaxed or not.” Copyright PUNCH.
