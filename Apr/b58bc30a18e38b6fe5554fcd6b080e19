Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party Caucus in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, described the large number of deaths witnessed in Kano State last week as unacceptable. It urged the Federal Government to investigate the incident and immediately set up a testing centre for COVID-19 in every state of the federation. The PDP reps scolded the Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, saying his efforts and that of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control were “largely lame, clueless and indeed devoid of any practical solutions.” The lawmakers’ position was contained in a statement signed by the leader of the caucus, Kingsley Chinda. Chinda said, “The health crisis and mysterious deaths of Nigerian citizens in Kano State are worrisome coming in the midst of the current coronavirus pandemic ravaging the world with Nigeria not left out. “It is apparent that so far, the efforts of the Kano State Government and particularly, that of the Federal Government through the NCDC and the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 seem to have been largely lame, clueless and indeed devoid of any practical solutions. “Silence in the face of mass deaths of our citizens is nothing but a heinous crime. “Consequently, we hereby demand an urgent and thorough investigation into it. “We equally demand practical and affirmative steps by the Federal Government into the circumstances surrounding the disturbing mass death in Kano State, with a view to finding lasting solutions to the problem.” Copyright PUNCH.
