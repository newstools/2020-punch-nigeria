Adeniyi Olugbemi, Sokoto Residents of Tamaje area in Sokoto have been exempted from paying electricity bill for the month of March. This is the outcome of the meeting with management of Kaduna Electric Company, following a protest march by the residents to the company’s Sokoto zonal office on Monday. Spokesman of the landlord’s association, Alhaji Saka Sadiq, while speaking with newsmen at the KAEDCO zonal office in Sokoto, commended the management for their decision to wave the payment of one-month bill for non-supply of electricity to the community. He further appealed for the quick restoration of light to the community, adding that the blackout resulted from cable theft by vandals. He said, “We spoke with the representative of the company and we were assured that our case was already in Kaduna and would be sorted out soon. “On our part, we assured them that the community had set up a security team to guard a new transformer when installed.” Copyright PUNCH.
