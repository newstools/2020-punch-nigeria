Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, has lamented the influx of people from other states despite the ban on inter-state movement. Speaking through his Special Adviser on Special Duties, Dr Doyin Odebowale, who visited the state boundaries on Sunday, alleged that the police were frustrating the effort of the government at containing the spread of the deadly disease by allowing people to enter the state after paying a bribe to the police. Addressing the policemen, Odebowale said, “You people are supposed to turn back any unauthorised vehicles but you allow them to pass through. You are corrupt. You are not doing your work.” However, the head of the police team, Mr Ebisine Amy, denied the allegation, saying the policemen at the boundary were doing the work professionally.
