Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has signed the certificates of occupancy pending since 2016. The state government described the development as a step that was certain to help businesses raise capital from banks and strengthen the local economy. Director General, Bureau of Land, Bolaji Edun, said in a statement on Friday that the feat was unprecedented in the recent history of the state. He said, “All in all, the governor has signed 175 C of Os. He also gave approval for 102 subsequent transactions like mortgages, leases, assignments that had been pending since 2016. “The effect of this singular act of the governor is that the economy of the state will pick up immediately after the COVID-19 lockdown.” He said the step would enable owners to access loans in the capital market to start or expand their businesses. “There will be inflow of capital to the state and this will have spiraling effects on the economy including the informal sector. It is going to be a win-win situation for everyone,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
