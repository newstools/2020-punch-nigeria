Kelvin Ekerete Super Eagles assistant coach, Joseph Yobo, says he will bring motivation, inspiration and consistency to the national team. The Nigeria Football Federation on February 12 announced the appointment of the former Eagles captain, a decision that has been questioned by sections of the football family who claim the ex-international does not have the required certification for the position. Yobo in an Instagram live chat with Colin Udoh monitored by our correspondent revealed that he was ready for the challenge. “I am bringing back that motivation. As a former captain, I’m bringing inspiration. I’ve been there and I’ve done it all. “I was a fan of the team before I became an assistant coach, so I’ve seen from a fanatical point of view how people feel when they are watching the team. We as players, while playing, don’t notice these things but after my retirement, I’ve been a pundit, I’ve given my opinion about what should be done in the team.” The 40-year-old also noted that having had a good career at club and country level for about 15 years, it will be time for him to add that sort of consistency to the team. “I’m bringing in my experience. Having over 15 years of consistency in my career, I think that is a lot. The good thing is that the spirit is going to improve. “Having been a pundit and looking at this team, I think we can go a lot higher with the quality we have.” Copyright PUNCH.
