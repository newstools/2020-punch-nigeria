Kelvin Ekerete Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr says it will be difficult for Odion Ighalo to return to the national team despite playing for English giants Manchester United. Ighalo called it quits with the national team after the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, where he emerged as tournament’s top scorer as Nigeria finished in third place. But Rohr believes Holland-based striker Cyriel Dessers and Lille hot prospect Victor Osimhen have what it takes to score goals for the national team in the absence of the retired Ighalo. He said, “We have Cyriel Dessers now. We have great strikers who can play the position too. There is a good foundation. We go forward all the time to find our players abroad. “For wingers, forwards, we have Samuel Chukwueze, Ahmed Musa, Samuel Kalu, Alex Iwobi and others too. We have what we need. These are players who have been to the World Cup and have played at some of the biggest stages in the world.” Rohr also stated that he had been in touch with Ighalo since he made his dream move to Manchester United. “We keep in touch all the time. There’s friendship between us (me and him), it’s more than business.” Copyright PUNCH.
