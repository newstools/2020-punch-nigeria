UMAR MUHAMMED Forty-two persons have been arrested and prosecuted for allegedly violating sanitation laws across the 13 local government areas of Nasarawa State. The Chief Prosecutor, Mr Abubakar Mohammed, told the court on Saturday in Lafia, that the suspects were apprehended while engaging in their private businesses when they should be observing the exercise. He said the mobile court handling environmental-related cases prosecuted about 42 persons who allegedly flouted sanitation laws. According to him, the offences contravened Section 9(2), of the State Environmental Sanitation Laws, and admonished the court to sanction them accordingly, to serve as deterrent to others. After listening to the submission of the prosecutor, the judge, Shittu Umar, sentenced the offenders to between two and four monthsâ€™ imprisonment. The judge, however, gave some of them options of fines. Briefing journalists, the state Commissioner for Environment and Natural Resources, Mr Musa Ibrahim, said the ministry had intensified monitoring to ensure that residents improved environmental hygiene. He urged members of the public to always keep their environment clean to guard against diseases. The last Saturday of every month is set aside for sanitation in the state. Copyright PUNCH.
