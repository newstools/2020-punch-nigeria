Dayo Ojerinde The lawmaker representing Ikeja Constituency 1 in the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mr Jimi Lai-Mohammed, has urged people not to panic about COVID-19, saying contracting the virus is not a death sentence. Lai-Mohammed said this while donating 2,000 sanitisers, two hand-held thermometers, 2,000 facemasks, and foodstuffs to his constituents. He said the donation, was in collaboration with the Citi Trust Group, to cushion the effect of COVID-19 on members of the Ikeja 1 constituency. Lai-Mohammed said, “Even as we must recognise that this virus does not mean death, we must recognise our urgent human duties and responsibilities. Life depends on sustenance; right now, at these times of contagion, life depends on breathing space literally. “Life depends on what we are fortunate enough to be able to give to others less fortunate today.” He expressed gratitude to the group for partnering with him on the initiative.
