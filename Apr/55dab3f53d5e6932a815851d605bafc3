Inter Milan are reportedly willing to entertain a straight-swap deal involving Lautaro Martinez and Barcelona forward Antoine Griezmann. Throughout the majority of the season, Martinez has been linked with a future switch to Camp Nou as Barcelona look to find a long-term replacement for Luis Suarez. However, as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, it remains to be seen whether European footballâ€™s top clubs will be able to spend big money in the transfer market. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter are prepared to consider exchanging Martinez for World Cup winner Griezmann without involving a fee. Despite netting 14 times during his first campaign at Barcelona, the 29-year-old may be allowed to leave the Catalan giants later in 2020. As it stands, however, the La Liga leaders are not ready to agree to a potential proposal which would effectively see Martinez replace Griezmann, rather than Suarez.
