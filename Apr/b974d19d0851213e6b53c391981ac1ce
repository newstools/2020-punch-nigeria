Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti A United States based-leader of Atunse Ekiti, a political movement of former Ekiti State Governor, Chief Segun Oni’s supporters, Chief Ayo Omolade, has said Oni’s return to the Peoples Democratic Party will help resolve the party’s leadership crisis in the state. Omolade, who said this in a telephone interview, on Tuesday, described Oni as a man of peace, who was able to use his position as the All Progressives Congress Deputy National Chairman (South), to resolve the crisis within the state APC. He expressed confidence that Oni would use his wealth of experience to resolve issues within the PDP. The recent PDP ward congresses held in Ekiti, saw a renewal of hostilities between supporters of former Governor Ayodele Fayose and Senator Biodun Olujimi, The political leader also gave an insight into why Oni decided to leave the APC. Omolade said, “There is no hope for the future aspirations of Chief Oni and his followers should they remain in the APC in view of the persecution they had faced. “Chief Oni used his position to bring together all factions and groups including the Action Group, the Restoration, the Ekiti APC Stakeholders and the Bibiire Group within Ekiti APC. “The settlement of conflicts enabled him to reposition the party to win the 2019 general elections in addition to mobilising votes across the 177 wards for APC. “The problem in PDP is not up to 20 per cent of the problem he met in the APC which God used him to solve. Chief Oni is a man of peace and he has the magic wand to settle quarrels between people.” Copyright PUNCH.
