Olufemi Atoyebi, Abuja The Nigeria Labour Congress on Tuesday called for the suspension of debt payment by Nigeria and other developing countries. In a statement signed by the President of the union, Ayuba Wabba, the NLC said that the country’s economy was weak and needed assistance. The union said that it aligned with the position of the International Trade Union Confederation which warned that failure to address the debt and financing needs of developing countries could trigger large-scale loss of lives and livelihoods. Ayuba said, “First, Nigeria is facing a dire economic crisis given the recent plunge in the price of crude oil, Nigeria’s major foreign exchange earner. This has already led to the downsizing of the capital expenditure in the 2020 national budget. “Second, in December 2019, Nigeria’s external debt hit a 16-year high of $27bn with a debt servicing commitment of $1.5bn.” In order to mobilise the necessary financial resources to fight and defeat COVID-19, the NLC boss called for a temporary suspension of debt payments.
