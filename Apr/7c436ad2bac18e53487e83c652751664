Consequently, the All-Share Index dipped 425.24 basis points or 2.02  per cent to close at 20,669.38 index points as against 21.094.62 recorded the previous trading session while market capitalisation of equities depreciated by N222bn from N10.993tn last Friday to N10.771tn as market sentiment remained on the negative territory.
