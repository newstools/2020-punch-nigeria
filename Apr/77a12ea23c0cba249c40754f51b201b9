Five bodies have been found during the search for 27 people that were swept overboard from an inter-island ferry that was travelling during a weather warning in the Solomon Islands. The bodies which include three females and two males were recovered on Sunday from the sea near Malaita Province, Solomon Islands Police said in a statement. “They were among 27 missing from the MV Taimareho, which was travelling from the capital Honiara to Malaita late Thursday. “The search will be suspended overnight and resume Monday morning,” the police said.

Late Thursday, the “only ship that made it out from here was the Taimareho,” Aonima said, adding the captain found out about them only after a headcount at the port of disembarkation. Cyclone Harold is now heading towards Vanuatu. (dpa/NAN)
