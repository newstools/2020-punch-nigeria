Dayo Ojerinde An entrepreneur, Mr Taiwo Olatoye, has appealed to the Federal Government to provide tax reliefs and waivers on loan repayment to schools, companies and other businesses in the country, saying the reliefs will cushion the hardship brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. Olatoye, who made the request in a statement on Friday, added that the pandemic called for strategic measures to save businesses from imminent collapse. According to him, with the decline in prices of oil on the international market, and the uncertainties that surround earnings, revitalising the economy by helping small businesses, industries and others to pull through the crisis is crucial. The entrepreneur, who congratulated the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on his appointment as ECOWAS COVID-19 Response Champion, drew his attention to the plight of industries, companies, schools and many others servicing loans from the Bank of Industry, banks, She Ventures by FCMB for women in business, individual entrepreneurs and other financial institutions. He said the businesses were facing increment in interest rates and repayment of loans and would need government intervention to remain afloat. Olatoye said, “The Federal Government should take measures to save small/large scale businesses, companies, institutions, private schools and organisations that are in great difficulty in paying back loans, salaries, settlement of outstanding bills, and logistics due to the pandemic.” Olatoye also urged governments at all levels to apply waiver on levies and taxes to help struggling businesses to avoid bankruptcy during the crisis.
