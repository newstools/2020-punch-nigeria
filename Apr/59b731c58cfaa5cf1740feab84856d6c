Sola Shittu, Benin The University of Benin Teaching Hospital, UBTH on Thursday dismissed report of panic in the hospital and called on anyone suspected to have coronavirus disease not to hesitate to visit the hospital. Dr Benson Okwara, head of Rapid Response for COVID-19  team of UBTH and Prof Ezekiel Ugiagbe, a consultant histopathology, said the two coronavirus patients in the hospital were in a stable condition and were anxious to go home and reunite with their families. The duo warned against creating fears among members of the public on the novel COVID-19, saying it was capable of sending patients, whose lives could be saved from the disease, away from receiving adequate and appropriate treatment. “There is no panic here at all and there is no reason for us to panic. For instance, if you remember the time of HIV-AIDS, if you were asked to come for HIV test, you would feel somehow, but does that mean you are afraid? Definitely not. We all face it and I want us to be clear about that. I should actually be on quarantine, if that is the word we should use, because I was the one that took samples and that means I am exposed,” he said. According to him, UBTH staff,  especially the Rapid Response Team, had been properly trained, adequately equipped and were motivated to help any person who might become infected with the disease. Ugiagbe, who is also the chairman, Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria, UBTH branch, said the hospital was still open for people and activities were still going on even in the face of Covid-19 lockdown. “Like in the health sector, activities are still going on but cannot be as high as before because people are scaling down because of the social distancing,” he said.
