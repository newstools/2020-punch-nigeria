Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate in the 2019 governorship election in Ogun State, Senator Buruji Kashamu, has said that the party’s suspended chairman, Chief Adebayo Dayo, is not interested in reconciling members of the party. Kashamu said this in a statement on Monday. He said, contrary to Dayo’s claim to facilitating reconciliation, he was only after “what he could grab before leaving office. That is the only reason why he betrayed the Ogun State PDP structure and its leadership by selling 70 per cent of the party structure to Ladi Adebutu and 30 per cent for himself.” Kashamu noted that while reconciliation was important to return the party in Ogun State to its winning ways, it is only the national body of the party that could broker it. He said, “I have never opposed any reconciliatory move because I know a tree does not make a forest. But, having shown his hands, Dayo cannot preside over any reconciliatory move. He cannot even be part of it because he does not have the integrity to do so. Rather, it should be championed by those who have the trust and confidence of the two main tendencies. The national leadership of the party is in a better position to call everyone, hear from them and resolve the issues in order for the PDP to move forward in Ogun State.” Kashamu said the attempt by Dayo to share the PDP exco among some people would fall through. He said, “Any purported agreement that Chief Dayo signed with anyone would not stand. Doing so after he was suspended for anti-party activities renders the whole move a nullity. It can never work. When we get to that bridge, we would cross it.” Copyright PUNCH.
