John Charles Makurdi The over 30 medical doctors allegedly sacked by the management of the Benue State University Teaching Hospital, Makurdi, have called on the state governor, Samuel Ortom, to intervene on the matter. The sacked doctors made the call at a press briefing in Makurdi where they displayed their sack letters to the public. Speaking during the press conference, the state president of the Association of Resident Doctors in the institution,  Dr Japhet Onyewuchi, said about 32 of their members were being unjustly laid off by the management. He explained that the sacking was done in bad faith and not in accordance with the laws regulating residency training in Nigeria. She dispelled the statement of the hospital management that the institution had not domesticated the Residency Training law in the hospital, hence its action which was based on the hospital policy. She said, “The Medical Residency Training Act (MRTA) was passed by the National Assembly in 2017. A year later, it was signed into law by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Mohammadu Buhari. “The Act regulates Residency Training in institutions anywhere in Nigeria and Benue State University Teaching Hospital is in Nigeria and ought to abide by the law.” “I therefore call on the Benue State governor, Dr Samuel Ortom, to intervene to avert further crisis in the health sector of the state,” Onyewuchi stressed.
