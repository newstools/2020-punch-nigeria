Oladimeji Ramon The National Union of Road Transport Workers in Oyo State has said its members have been faced with financial hardship since Governor Seyi Makinde proscribed the union about a year ago. It, therefore, appealed to the Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes and prominent individuals in the state to plead with the governor on its behalf to lift the proscription. The union made the appeal in a statement signed by its leaders — Alhaji Abideen Olajide, aka Ejiogbe; Alhaji Lateef Opeyemi; Alhaji Waheed Adeoyo; Alhaji Abass Amolese, Alhaji Raufu Oloruntobi and Alhaji Lekan Aleshinloye, on Monday. They urged the governor to note that the union members had been law-abiding since about 11 months that the union was proscribed by the government. They said, “The NURTW in the state has continued to be law-abiding almost a year after the proscription of its activities by the administration of Governor Seyi Makinde, despite the fact that the teeming members are suffering with many of them not having means to take care of their families. “We are therefore appealing to our traditional rulers, the CCII and prominent indigenes of the state to prevail on the governor to lift the proscription in the interest of the members who have continued to work for the development of the state.” Meanwhile, the union commended the state’s efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and appealed to residents to cooperate with government.
