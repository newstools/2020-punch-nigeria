Samuel Awoyinfa One of Nigeria’s non-bank financial services providers, Rosabon Financial Services, says it has a personal loan package up to N6m at a low-interest rate to eligible salary earners in the light of the coronavirus crisis. The firm, in a statement, said eligible individuals could get non-collateralised personal loans up to that amount, with a flexible repayment plan of up to 15 months. It added that the loan would be available to both new and existing customers as many had suffered financial strain during the lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic. The firm noted that the rapid spread of the virus and the sudden measures implemented by the authorities to curtail its spread had put a heavy financial strain on individuals, their families and the economy, as many households already had their incomes cut or stopped altogether. The loan, it stated, would ensure financial access to sustain livelihood and meet pressing needs, be it feeding, rent or other financial emergencies. Speaking on the provision of the private sector loan facility, the Managing Director of Rosabon Financial Services, Mr Chukwuma Ochonogor, said, “As Nigerians deal with the growing challenges of COVID-19, our priority is to support them in any way possible. “The goal is to provide critical cash flow during this economic crisis at a low-interest rate.” Ochonogor added that the provision of the company’s loan service became imperative “in the wake of the lockdown due to the ongoing spread of coronavirus.” Copyright PUNCH.
