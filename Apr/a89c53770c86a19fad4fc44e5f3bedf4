Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Kaduna State Commissioner of Health, Dr Amina Mohammed-Baloni, said one of the six COVID-19 patients in the state has been discharged from the Infectious Disease Centre. The commissioner, who stated this on Wednesday, said the patient has recovered following treatment at the isolation centre. She said the patient had tested negative for coronavirus twice and the second result came in on Tuesday,  April 14. She said the government is looking forward to the recovery and discharge of the five other patients. “We also wish to pay tribute to the medical professionals at the Infectious Disease Centre for the successful management of this patient,” she said while appreciating health officials. “The Ministry of Health wishes to remind residents of Kaduna State that it is safer and cheaper to observe preventive measures than to treat COVID-19. Citizens must wash their hands regularly with soap and water and scrupulously observe social distancing. “They are also advised to avoid large gatherings and stay at home, except it is absolutely necessary to go out. Wherever they are, they should also practise respiratory hygiene,” she advised.
