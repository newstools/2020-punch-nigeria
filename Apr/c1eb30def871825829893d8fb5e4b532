’Femi Asu The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council said on Wednesday that it had engaged 650 small and medium-sized enterprises in a bid to provide support to them at this time of crisis. PEBEC said in a statement that it commenced its fifth 60-day National Action Plan on February 5, 2020 aimed at the rapid implementation of targeted reforms for the improvement of Nigeria’s business environment. It said the NAP 5.0 was billed to run from February 5, 2020 to April 4, 2020, but the reforms implemented so far covered only the first 38 days of the 60-day accelerator, due to disruptions to work caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Special Adviser to the President on Ease of Doing Business, Dr Jumoke Oduwole, said, “While the NAP 5.0 reform window is on hold for now, the implementation of outstanding reforms will resume in earnest immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown comes to an end.” Oduwole, who is the secretary to PEBEC, said during the lockdown, the PEBEC Secretariat had maintained close contact with small and medium-sized businesses and key organised private sector bodies nationwide.
