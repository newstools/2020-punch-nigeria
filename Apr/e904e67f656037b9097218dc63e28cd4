Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri Governor Hope Uzodinma has debunked the speculation that he intended to rename Imo State University, Owerri, after late Chief of Staff to the president, Abba Kyari. Uzodinma’s spokesperson, Oguwike Nwachuku, made this known in a press statement on Tuesday. He said that the speculation was “false”. The statement read in part, “The author(s) of the fake news had not only credited to the governor what he could not have said, but they criminally wrote the name of his Chief Press Secretary/Media Adviser, Mr. Oguwike Nwachuku, as the one who signed the purported statement.
