Kayode Oyero Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has said one of the coronavirus patients in the state was tested in Lagos State but receiving treatment at an isolation facility in Akure, the state capital. The governor, who made this known on Saturday via Twitter, said the patient, a police officer, who was tested in Lagos but came to Ondo endangered the lives of residents in the state. Akeredolu described the officer’s action as reckless and one that posed a risk to public health and safety. He said, “Earlier today, I got news of another positive case of COVID-19 admitted to our facility in Akure. “The case of this individual who is a police officer is unique. He was tested in Lagos but came to Ondo state while awaiting his results. “Upon receiving a positive result, he claimed to have returned back to Lagos. “According to him, he waited a few days in Lagos to be picked up. When this failed, he panicked and rushed back to Akure for treatment. “While we appreciate the confidence reposed in our facilities, we do find it most reckless on the part of the officer of the law to risk the lives of others. The police officer should know better. “I am most disappointed in the level of porosity of the entry points to the state. “I have contacted the commissioner of police to double up on securing our entry points.” According to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control as of Saturday night, four of the 1182 cases of the infection in Nigeria were reported in Ondo State. Meanwhile, the Nigeria Governors’ Forum restricted interstate movement in all the 36 states of the federation as part of measures to curb the spread of coronavirus.
