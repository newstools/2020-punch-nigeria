Maiharaji Altine, Gusau The Zamfara State Police Command has succeeded in arresting a notorious bandit, one Junaidu Shehu, of the Fasa Gora village in the Bukkuyum Local Government Area of the state. The command’s spokesperson, SP Mohammed Shehu, said in a statement that the suspect and his gang had for long been terrorising the people of the state, particularly residents of his own community. “The suspect had on several occasions conspired with members of his gang to perpetrate most of the attacks and kidnappings against the people of his own community,” the police spokesperson said. According to Shehu, there are several pieces of evidence that expose his active involvement in killings and kidnappings against the residents of his village. Shehu said, “Sometime in 2019, the suspect, in concert with other bandits at large, invaded the Fasa Gora village and kidnapped the daughter of the district head of the village and collected N1m before the girl regained her freedom. “Similarly, in the same year 2019, the suspect and his co-conspirators brutally ambushed and killed four vigilante members, who were defending the village against all forms of attacks by the bandits. “Similarly, the suspect and his cohorts attacked the same village and killed substantial number of people.” The PPRO added that the suspect was currently in custody and assisting the police to arrest other members of his gang.
