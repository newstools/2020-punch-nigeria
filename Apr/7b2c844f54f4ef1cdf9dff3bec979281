Ihuoma Chiedozie, The Bureau of Public Enterprises has said it will provide palliatives to 1,200 vulnerable households in the Federal Capital Territory towards cushioning the harsh effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The Director-General of the BPE, Mr. Alex Okoh, said this during the distribution of food items to some households in Yimitu village, in the Apo area of the FCT, on Friday. Three hundred bags of assorted foodstuffs were distributed during the programme. Okoh explained that the Bureau was moved to embark on the gesture given the hardship many Nigerians were subjected to as a result of the lockdown ordered by the Federal Government to curb the spread of the pandemic. According to him, the gesture was initiated and supported solely by the management and staff of the BPE. “Contrary to the belief that privatised enterprises in the country are part of the initiative, their contribution is to the Federal Government’s Presidential Committee on COVID-19,” he explained. He added that in line with the criterion set up for the distribution of the items, preference would be given to widows and single mothers. Copyright PUNCH.
