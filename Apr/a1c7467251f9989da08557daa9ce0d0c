Femi Makinde The Arogbo Ijaw Community Organisation  of Ese-Local Government Area of Ondo State has warned Governor Rotimi Akeredolu against instigating the suspension of the lawmaker representing Ese-Odo Constituency at the House of Assembly, Chief Success Torukerijo. The community group also passed a vote of confidence in the lawmaker, who they said spoke to condemn the  exclusion of Ijaw people from the state COVID-19 Palliative Committee recently constituted by the governor. The Chairman of AICO,  James Ashidi,  said  in a statement on Friday that the lawmaker spoke the mind of his people when he decried the alleged marginalisation of  his constituents by the governor. He added that the lawmaker did well by crying out against the ‘repeated marginalisation’ of the Ijaw people by the Akeredolu government. The statement read, “Governor Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN) and the leadership of the All Progressives Congress are  engrossed in moves to suspend the lawmaker from the  House of Assembly for crying out against years of deprivation, intimidation and oppression against the minority Ijaw in the state. “Those involved in the devilish plot against the cry of the Ijaw for recognition as citizens of Ondo State under a seeming apartheid regime should desist from it. The constituents of the lawmaker would stand by him.” The Ijaw group also opposed the alleged handing over the development of Arogbo Ijaw to the Ondo State Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi.
