The Nigerian Communications Commission says there is no relationship between the Fifth Generation Technology and the coronavirus pandemic. The commission’s Director of Public Affairs, Dr Henry Nkemadu, made this clarification in a statement following recent materials being circulated on social media, linking COVID-19 with 5G Technology. The statement, which was signed by Nkemadu, on Monday in Abuja, said it has become imperative for the commission to provide some clarifications. According to him, there is no correlation between 5G Technology and COVID-19. He said, “5G is an advancement on today’s 4G technology designed to transform the world positively. “Secondly, there is no deployment of 5G in Nigeria at the moment. “The NCC back in November 2019 approved trial test for 5G for a period of three months and that the trial has been concluded and installation decommissioned. “The trial among others was to study and observe any health or security challenges the 5G network might present. Relevant stakeholders including members of the security agencies were invited to participate during the trial. “We have spectrum, particularly the millimetre wave spectrum from 24GHz and above are available. We have not given out 5G spectrum to operators. It will be auctioned at the appropriate time. “The NCC will continue to maintain its policy of technology neutrality and will continue to encourage service providers to deploy the best technology that will meet the needs of the society in a secured and friendly manner,” he said.
