Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The South African Government on Sunday evacuated about 136 of its citizens from Nigeria through the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. The citizens were evacuated by the national carrier, South African Airways, which departed the airport at about 7pm. The evacuation is the latest in the series of ongoing repatriation of foreign nationals from Nigeria due to the coronavirus pandemic. The United States Mission in Nigeria last week said it had helped 997 Americans return home through organised chartered flights operated by Delta Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines. The US Consulate said it had repatriated 850 American citizens from the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos in addition to the 147 who departed from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja on April 4. Germany, France, Netherlands, Canada and Isreal had also repatriated their citizens from Nigeria, in the past two weeks. Copyright PUNCH.
