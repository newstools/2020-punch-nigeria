Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Osun State Government has said it will begin distribution of palliatives to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 induced lockdown on residents as from today, Wednesday. The government had ordered a 14-day lockdown, starting from Wednesday, April 1, to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the state. Secretary to the State Government, Wole Oyebamiji, announced the decision while receiving donations of food items from Wema Bank on Tuesday. He said the distribution would be done across all polling units in the state. Oyebamiji said, “The distribution would start as from Wednesday (today) at each of the polling centres. It is believed that people within a particular polling centre know themselves and they will distribute among themselves. It will cut across party lines and it will be done door to door to avoid unnecessary crowd.” Earlier, before presenting the donated items, the Osun State Zonal Manager, Wema Bank PLC, Adeyeni Adeniji, said the bank was donating over 3,000 bags of rice, noodles and vegetable oil worth over N10m.
