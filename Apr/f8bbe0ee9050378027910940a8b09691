Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia The Abia State Government said it would commence the distribution of relief materials to the vulnerable people to cushion the effect of the lockdown of the State starting today (Tuesday). The state Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, said this after inspecting materials which included bags of rice, beans, garri, tubers of yam, noodles as well as hand sanitizers and face masks meant for distribution to the people of the state. Ikpeazu said the distribution would be done in a segregated manner to cover about six churches at a time. He pointed out that the strategy was to distribute the items through the churches, mosques, traditional rulers and president generals of town unions to reach out to the less privileged individuals in their communities, adding that by so doing, 70 per cent of Abia people would be reached. According to him, the government could not provide all that was required to alleviate the sufferings of the people as a result of the lockdown. The governor also said the fumigation of markets and institutions in the state would also commence today. Ikpeazu explained that after the first 14 days, it will become compulsory for every resident of the state to wear a mask. He also said the Inter-ministerial Committee would today (Tuesday), do a review of the lockdown with a view to determining the next step to take. Copyright PUNCH.
