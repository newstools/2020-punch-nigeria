Umar Muhammed, Lafia The Nasarawa State Government has yet to fulfil its promise to equip the Internally Displaced Persons camp, which was recently converted to isolation centre in the Shabu area of Lafia-East Development Area of the state. The Chairman of Task Force Committee on COVID-19, who is also the state Deputy Governor, Dr Emmanuel Akabe, had on Tuesday last week told The Punch that the Shabu Isolation Centre would be ready this week Tuesday. Alabe had said, “As I am talking to you now, there are over 360 mattresses already and we have placed order for 200 beds which will be coming next week.” But, our correspondent, who visited the centre on Thursday, observed that the 48 rooms remained empty. Our correspondent, who monitored the ongoing work at the centre, however, observed that about 48 rooms had been painted and renovated. Akabe told our correspondent, “We are going to evacuate all the mattresses and beds at the isolation centre in the Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital, Lafia to Shabu isolation centre.” Copyright PUNCH.
