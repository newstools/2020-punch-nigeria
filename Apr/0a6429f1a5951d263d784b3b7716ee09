Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The former Kogi State Commissioner for Culture and Tourism, Paul Ebije, has been ordered to account for about N69m, money allegedly meant for the rehabilitation of eleven tourist sites in the state. Our correspondent gathered that the former commissioner allegedly diverted the funds, a matter that has now become an issue that would have to be unravelled by men of the Criminal Investigation Department, Kogi State Police Command. As at press time, all heads of department of the ministry and the immediate past permanent secretary of the ministry had been invited for questioning over the missing funds and were seen at the command headquarters of the Nigerian Police. The HoDs who were all gripped by fear following the invitation and arrest, however, feigned ignorance of the way the money developed wings, as many of them claimed not to be in the know of the amount allegedly diverted. The state police Command while confirming the development through the public relations, DSP William Aya, said the matter was before the police criminal investigation department and that investigation into the matter is on to unravel those behind the missing funds. The matter according to source came up following a petition by an insider of the ministry and the state government is not taking the matter with kids gloves. Copyright PUNCH.
