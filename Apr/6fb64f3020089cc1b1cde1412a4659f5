Sola Shittu, Benin A governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, in Edo State, Mr Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has expressed confidence that the party will elect the right candidate in order to retain power in the governorship election scheduled for September this year. Ize-Iyamu said this in a statement by his campaign organisation in Benin on Thursday. Ize-Iyamu said, “As I have told my followers across the state before, this is not the time to throw jibes or offer disrespect to the aspirants or members of the party. We must regard each other with peace, love, and unwavering respect knowing that at the end of the day, our desire for a better Edo State is one and the same.” The governorship hopeful who held a meeting with the members of the Ize-Iyamu Support Organisation, urged them to among other things, examine ways to help the state in the fight against COVID-19. He called for a united front to achieve the party’s founding ideology of equitable distribution of resources and purposeful governance. Copyright PUNCH.
