Sola Shittu, Benin Col. David Imuse (retd.), a leader of the All Progressives Congress in Edo State loyal to the National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, on Monday described the exit of Governor Godwin Obaseki’s Chief of Staff, Mr Taiwo Akerele, from his government as a sign of failure. Imuse in a statement in Benin on Monday congratulated the former Chief of Staff for the courage and wisdom he displayed in resigning from the state government. He said, “The government of Obaseki has failed to meet the yearnings and wellbeing of the people of Edo State and the APC, the party that brought him to power. “It is very unfortunate that a governor that was elected via a political party suddenly grew to be rude, insubordinate and never meant well for the party through which he was elected. “The APC as a disciplined political party believes in party supremacy, loyalty to constituted authority and to act otherwise is very alien to the party.” Imuse condemned the use of security agents and hoodlums to harass Akerele whose house was searched by security operatives on Sunday while his Personal Assistant, Jaspa Olowojoba and security man were arrested. “I condemn the use of hoodlums, thugs and security agents to harass Akerele for his wise decision in very severe terms by Governor Obaseki,” said Imuse. He also appealed to other party members who had found themselves in the same shoes like Akerele to come to the main stream of the party. Copyright PUNCH.
