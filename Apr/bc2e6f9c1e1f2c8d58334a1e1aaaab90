Our gratitude goes to these gallant men and women and all warriors making the nation proud in the face of this scourge,” the hospital tweeted. The Chairman of the Medical Advisory Committee of the hospital, Prof. Wasiu Adeyemo, in an interview with our correspondent, said the newborn was doing well, but her sample would be taken for a test soon.
