Success Nwogu and Daniels Igoni Former President Goodluck Jonathan and the Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri, have described the death of former Peoples Democratic Party governorship aspirant, Keniebi Okoko, as shocking. In separate statements, on Thursday, the two leaders said news of the demise of the PDP chieftain was shocking. Okoko, who was a businessman and a co-contestant in the PDP’s September 4, 2019 governorship primary which produced Diri as the party candidate, died in a Lagos hospital on Tuesday, at the age of 42. The former President in a condolence message to the father of the deceased, Prof. Kimse Okoko, noted that the billionaire died in his prime. Jonathan said, “His death is shocking and most painful as he was in his prime. Without a doubt, Keniebe still had a lot to offer to the progress and development of Bayelsa State and Nigeria as he was a young man full of great ideas and lofty dreams.” Speaking in a similar vein, Diri, who described the late 42-year-old Okoko as “an Ijaw icon, pillar and astute businessman,” added that Bayelsa, the Ijaw nation and indeed Nigeria, had lost a philanthropist and young politician with great potential. In a statement by his acting Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, the governor condoled with the Okoko family and Obunagha community in Gbarain clan, in Yenagoa Local Government Area.
