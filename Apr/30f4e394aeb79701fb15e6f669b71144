Nike Popoola Access Bank Plc says it is at the forefront of the interventions deployed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic by big players in the private sector. In a statement, the bank said it played a major role in the formation of the coalition against COVID-19, a task force instituted to ensure the minimisation of the impact of coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria. “With a guiding strategy of making impactful social investments, and giving back to the society, this new joint effort with other members of CACOVID has seen the bank donate N1bn to facilitate the building of 1000-bed isolation centres across the six geopolitical zones of the country,” it stated. The bank said the building of the test and isolation centres would be in phases. It added that the first phase of the project was the construction of additional testing and isolation centres in Lagos (Yaba and Gbagada), Enugu, Kano, Port Harcourt, Borno and Abuja. “The next phase of the project will see the construction of additional centres in more states of the federation to enable early detection and testing of suspected COVID-19 cases as well as treatment of confirmed cases,” it stated. Speaking on the bank’s activities, the Group Managing Director, Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, said, “In our characteristic manner of offering ‘more than banking’, Access Bank is at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19.
