The Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnibe Mamora, has said that part of the protocol in the management of COVID-19 cases was that health workers in the forefront would undergo testing. He said this in Abuja at a media briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, The PUNCH reports. He said, “Testing for health workers will be routine and as indicated, if any health worker comes up with symptoms that are suggesting, that health worker will be tested. If any health worker has come in contact with any case, that health worker will have to go into self-isolation. What we are doing is to ensure that health workers are properly protected so that they are not unduly exposed. It is the minimum we owe them.” The Chairman of the task force and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, noted members were touring some states to assess their infrastructure and their readiness for COVID-19.
