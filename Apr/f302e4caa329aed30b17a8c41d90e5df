Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi The Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has said no fewer than  345 Almajiri have been received by the state from other states. The governor who stated this at a press conference on Wednesday at the Government House, Bauchi, said over 198 almajiris brought into the state from Plateau State had been quarantined. He said the teacher of the almajiris children from Plateau State had shown symptoms of COVID-19. He said, “We have received a total of 345 from some states in the north.” Mohammed gave a breakdown of some of the Almajiri to include ‘198 from Plateau State, with only the Mallam having symptoms and he will be treated; 42 almajiris returning from Kano which is a high risk area. All their samples have been taken and they have been quarantined.” He added that 38 Almajiris from Gombe State were returned while “six of the Kaduna returnees have symptoms (of COVID-19) and they are under quarantined and we are going to take their samples.” The governor said the state had started profiling some of the Almajiris that were not from Bauchi with intention of repatriating them to their respective states, adding that there were some Almajiris from other countries like Niger in the state who will also be taken back. “In the whole north, we are the state with the least number of Almajiris and we are the ones with the highest number of Almajiris.” Copyright PUNCH.
