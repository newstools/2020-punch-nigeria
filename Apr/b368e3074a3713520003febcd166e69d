Kelvin Ekerete Manchester United are ready to lift the purchase option in the loan contract of striker, Odion Ighalo. Ighalo has scored four goals in eight appearances for the Red Devils since making a loan move to the Manchester side from Chinese club, Shanghai Shenhua during the January transfer window. According to Manchester Evening News, the Mancunian executives are ready to exercise the option to buy Ighalo in the summer after the expiration of his loan deal at the club. Ighalo recently revealed that there was no offer on the table yet from United majorly due to the fact that his loan deal is not yet complete. The decision to keep Ighalo in the team beyond the summer will lie on players the team will be willing to bring into the team. The Red Devils have been linked to high profile strikers including Borussia Dortmund’s Jordon Sancho and Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane. Copyright PUNCH.
