Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has directed that salaries of all political appointees in the state be slashed by 50 per cent with immediate effect. Fayemi said savings from the pay cut would be channelled to the execution and completion of developmental projects in the state. The directive is contained in a statement issued by the Commissioner for Information, Muyiwa Olumilua, in Ado Ekiti, on Tuesday. Fayemi explained that the pay cut was due to slump in the global economy as a result of the adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic. Olumilua said, “The pay cut will affect the governor, the deputy governor and all political appointees down the line. “Salaries of civil servants will not be affected by this directive, and shall maintain status quo. “This sacrifice is for the welfare of the Ekiti people, which should take pre-eminence over and above all other considerations. “As a responsive and responsible government, the Fayemi-led administration has taken stock of our financial situation, vis-a-vis our constantly decreasing receipts from the Federation Account, as well as our dwindling internally generated revenue and has been forced to wake up to the current realities of our fiscal position. “With promises made to the Ekiti people while seeking their mandate, coupled with the moral duty of improving their welfare, a time for making difficult decisions is at hand, and make them we must.” Copyright PUNCH.
