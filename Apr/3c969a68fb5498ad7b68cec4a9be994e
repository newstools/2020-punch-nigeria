Ebenezer Bajela Villarreal striker Samuel Chukwueze says he is a big fan of Chelsea and admitted that  he cried after watching the English giants lose in the Champions League final to rivals Manchester United in 2008. Chukwueze added that he was on the verge of joining Arsenal before a  break down in talks with Diamond Football Academy and the Gunners. Responding to questions on Instagram Live, the 20-year-old opened up on his ambition to one day play in the English Premier League. “My favourite team in England is Chelsea,” Chukwueze said in an Instagram Live. “I was supporting Chelsea when I was young. When Chelsea lost that Champions League final against Manchester United, I was crying all through the night. “Playing in England is still an ambition for me. “I really want to play in England. It was very close for me to sign for Arsenal, I almost had the contract in my hands. “Unfortunately, it did not work out fine with my academy due to the side of agreement and payment. “They did not agree with the terms of the contract.” Copyright PUNCH.
