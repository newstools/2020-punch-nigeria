Raphael Ede, Enugu The Civil Liberties Organisation on Tuesday called on the Federal Government to take urgent steps to evacuate Nigerians trapped in China and other parts of the world. In its letter to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), on Tuesday signed by its Executive Director, Ibuchukwu Ezike, the CLO’s stated that over 300 Nigerians, who travelled to China for business activities before the coronavirus pandemic, had been trapped and had cried out to the organisation for help. The letter read, “In several distress phone communications to the CLO on Monday night, the Nigerians said that they had been disallowed to return to Nigeria after they had completed their business activities in China. They said they had been subjected to various inhuman and degrading treatments including repeated tests, being quarantined in hotels, denial of access to Nigerian foods and serial taking away of their colleagues from their hotel rooms to unknown places. “The Nigerians prayed the CLO to appeal to President Muhammad Buhari and the United Nations to come to their aid and save them from avoidable hardship and death. They said the Nigerian Embassy in China had failed woefully to intervene in their interest.” The organisation appealed to the President to ask the Chinese Government to allow Nigerians to return without further delay. ”Copyright PUNCH.
