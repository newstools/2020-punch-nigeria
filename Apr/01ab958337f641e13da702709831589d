Ebenezer Bajela The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has commiserated with the family of the late President of the Nigeria Weightlifting Federation, Yahaya Muhammed, who died on Saturday in Kano after a brief illness. In a statement signed by the media office of the minister, Dare acknowledged that the leadership of the wrestling federation would be greatly missed. “The minister noted that the sterling leadership provided for the federation by Muhammed in his lifetime would be greatly missed by the wrestling federation and the sporting industry in Nigeria at large,” the media statement read. Nigeria won its highest number of medals in weightlifting under the stewardship of Muhammed with, 16 gold, 13 silver and 18 bronze medals at the 2019 African Games. Copyright PUNCH.
