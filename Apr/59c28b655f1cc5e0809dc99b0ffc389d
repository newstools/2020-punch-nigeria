Ebenezer Bajela President of the National Association of Nigeria Professional Footballers, Tijani Babangida, has expressed optimism over the well-being of the Nigeria Professional Football League players, saying NANPF was working to ensure that clubs paid their players’ salaries. The coronavirus has seen all sporting activities in the world halted, with a massive effects on clubs’ finances, forcing owners to slash players’ salaries in the European leagues, which has led to concerns over the fate of the NPFL payers. However, former Super Eagles winger Babangida, in a chat with Sports Yarn Class on Sunday, assured that they would ensure players’ salaries were taken care of. “This is a trying time, not for only Tijani Babangida but the whole people in the world and for sure I am keeping safe which is the best thing to do,” Babangida said. “When you talk of players union and football, you are definitely talking about FIFA and those that are affiliated to them and we are affiliated to NFF and FIFPro as well. “And of course we are talking to FIFA, LMC and even with NFF at the same time and trying to see how we can be able to work together. “For instance the case that happened with Yobe Stars where the club just woke up one day and said 75 per cent of the players’ salaries should be cut off, which we immediately reacted to.” The ex-Ajax forward added that they had already written to the NFF to have a stakeholders meeting to discuss issues with the clubs so that they could pay salaries. “You will see that aside Yobe Stars, I don’t think any club in Nigeria in the Premier League has any issue with that. “We are opening and watching to see where players are having issues so that we can intercept.” Copyright PUNCH.
