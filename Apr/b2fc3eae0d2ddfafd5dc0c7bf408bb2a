Tukur Muntari, Kano The Kano State Government has commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for the measures so far taken to curb the Covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria as a whole and the state in particular. The state Commissioner for Information, Mallam Muhammad Garba, said this in a statement in Kano on Tuesday. He expressed hope that the lockdown announced by the President coupled with the efforts of the Ganduje-led administration would go a long way in curbing further spread of the virus. Garba said, “With the ongoing comprehensive investigation into the pandemic in the state, the deployment of additional Federal Government manpower, material and technical resources as announced by the President to strengthen and support the state government’s efforts would equally help in extenuating the pandemic.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
