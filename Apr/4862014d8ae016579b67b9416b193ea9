Enyioha Opara, Minna The Niger State Government has, with effect from Sunday, relaxed the ongoing curfew to enable the people to stock food and other essentials. The Secretary to the State Government, Ibrahim Maitane, said this in Minna, on Sunday. Maitane said government had earlier imposed a curfew from 10am to 12 midnight following residents’ non-compliance with the sit-at-home order towards the spread of COVID-19 in the state. He said, “In this new order of relaxing curfew, civil servants on grade levels one to 12, earlier directed to stay off work as part of measures taken by government to curb the spread of COVID-19, are now to resume work on Monday, April 6, 2020 from 8 am to 2pm. “All entering points to the state remain close except those on essential services. Markets are to open from 8am to 2pm.” Maitane, however, said, “If drastic and sustained actions are not taken and the disease spreads in Niger State, the existing health facilities and infrastructures will grossly be inadequate to deal with the challenges.” Copyright PUNCH.
