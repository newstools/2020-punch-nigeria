Raphael Ede, Enugu The Enugu State High Court, presided over by Justice K.I. Okpe, has restrained the Inspector-General of Police, Adamu Abubakar, from arresting the state Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Dr Ben Nwoye. Nwoye had approached the court to seek a restraining order following persistent calls from operatives of the IGP Response Command from the force headquarters, Abuja, asking him to report. The suit, marked E/228/2020, which our correspondent sighted on Monday, had Dr Ben Nwoye; the APC Legal Adviser, Benjamin Nebe, and the APC state Administrative Secretary, Evarestus Asadu, as applicants, while the Foreign Affairs Minister, Geoffrey Onyema, his personal Assistant, Flavour Eze, the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, and the officer in-charge IGP Intelligence Response Team Command were listed as respondents. Justice Okpe said, “It is hereby ordered as follows: That an order of interim injunction is hereby granted to the applicants restraining the respondents whether by themselves, their agents, men, officers or privies from arresting, detaining or in any manner restricting the applicants’ rights to personal liberty and freedom of movement pending the hearing and determination of the substantive motion on notice. “This suit is further adjourned to 6/5/2020 as next return date.” Nwoye said he had approached the court for protection as his life was being allegedly threatened.
