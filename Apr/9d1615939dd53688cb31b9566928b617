Peter Dada, Akure A group, the Indigenous People of Ondo, on Monday, faulted the committees set up by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to source for funds and to distribute palliatives to the people of the state. The governor had last week set up fundraising and palliatives committees to ameliorate the sufferings of the people of the state during the lockdown. He named Mr Kayode Falowo and Mr Akin Olotu, respectively as heads. In an interview with journalists, in Akure, on Monday, the Chairman of the IPO, Mr Austin Pelemo, faulted the composition of the committees, saying notable indigenes of the state were left out. He also said the inclusion of the governor’s son, Babajide Akeredolu, in the fundraising committee, was an act of nepotism. Pelemo said, “The preponderance of the opinion of the people of Ondo State (is to) reject the composition of the list submitted by the governor, particularly the nomination of Babajide, who is the governor’s son, as the secretary of the committee and the auditing company, SIAO, which is managed by Akeredolu’s in-law, Mr Runsewe, a brother to Lakunle Runsewe, the husband of Yejide Runsewe, Akeredolu’s daughter. “Further to this nepotism is the fact that majority of the people in the committee are from Owo, the governor’s hometown. The chairman, secretary, and two members of the committee are from Owo. The implication of this is that, Arakunrin Akeredolu does not trust anybody outside his family and relatives from Owo to handle cash on behalf of the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
