Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Perekeme Kpodoh, has expressed confidence that the immediate past governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, will win the forthcoming Bayelsa West senatorial bye-election. He said this would happen should Dickson emerge as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party. The Bayelsa West Senatorial District is made up of Sagbama and Ekeremor local government areas. It became vacant following the election of the former occupant, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, as the state deputy governor. The APC chieftain said, “It is not about the disagreements we had when he was a governor. It is about Dickson’s political sagacity and dogged style. “He is the first (person) to complete two terms as a governor. He also took development to his senatorial district when he was a governor.” Copyright PUNCH.
