Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The Federal Government has taken delivery of medical supplies from Istanbul, Turkey, to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The supplies were delivered by an Air Peace aircraft, a Boeing 777 with registration number, 5N-BWI, which arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja on Saturday night. It was gathered that the flight left Nigeria early Saturday morning for the seven-hour flight to Turkey and was able to airlift the supplies and returned to Nigeria before midnight. The medical supplies are said to be the first batch as an Air Peace Boeing 777 ER with registration number 5N-BVE is expected to leave for Beijing, China on Monday (today) for another batch. The Chief Operating Officer of Air Peace, Mrs Toyin Olajide, said the Federal Government deserved commendation for its efforts to rid the country of coronavirus. “The management of Air Peace commends the Federal Government for being proactive in the preparation for emergencies, preventing the spread of the virus and also providing the kits and other medical equipment for the treatment of those infected by the pandemic,” Olajide said. According to the COO, the effort shows that government is ready to fight the disease. Copyright PUNCH.
