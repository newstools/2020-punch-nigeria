Oladimeji Ramon The immediate-past governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, has donated N10m to the state to fight coronavirus. Dickson disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday personally signed by him. He said he gave the N10m to the Bayelsa State COVID-19 Committee, through his Henry Seriake Dickson Foundation. The former governor said the N10m was only an addition to “the several support measures I have given to individuals and groups across the state.” He said now that Bayelsa had recorded its index case of COVID-19, all leaders in the state must rally round the governor to ensure that the dreadful coronavirus was defeated.
