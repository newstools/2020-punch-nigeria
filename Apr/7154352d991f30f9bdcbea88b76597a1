Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Health and Managed Care Association of Nigeria has asked the Federal Government to monitor the deployment of funds for the containment of COVID-19 by state governments. The association which is the umbrella group of health maintenance organisations in the country said the donations from the big players in the private sector and the investment in the health sector must be properly managed and utilised for the benefit of Nigerians. Speaking in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja on Friday, the HMCAN spokesman,  Mr Lekan Ewenla, said the group was concerned about the future of the isolation facilities being set up across the country, noting that they should be converted into permanent healthcare centres as a way of expanding the health infrastructure in the nation. He commended the states and federal government for investing heavily in critical health facilities to manage the coronavirus pandemic. Ewenla said, ” We want the government to meticulously monitor the expenditure of the states towards the management and control of COVID-19. “Quite a number of state governments are deploying so much funds to the procurement of medical equipment, setting up isolation centres, and what should be the major concern of every human being is what happens post-COVID-19 to all these facilities.” The HMCAN spokesman added, “For us in the organised private sector, we are quite worried because we are quite concerned about the development of this country and we feel strongly that state governments should be encouraged to convert those facilities and equipment to permanent healthcare facilities.”
