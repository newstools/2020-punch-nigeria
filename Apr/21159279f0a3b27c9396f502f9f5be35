Kayode Oyero Nigerian Air Force has configured its C130 aircraft to airlift coronavirus patients to isolation centres, The PUNCH reports. Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, said the move was to support the efforts of government in the fight against the pandemic. Speaking on TVC on Friday, Abubakar noted that the airlift was important especially for areas where vehicular movement was difficult. According to him, the aircraft has the capacity to airlift more than 70 patients at once to different isolation centres across the country. He said selected medical personnel of the Force have been trained to provide excellent and safe services to Nigerians at this critical point of the nation’s history. He added that the Force was also working on producing its ventilators and was at the final stage of the process. He said, “We have not only been able to give the required training to our personnel but we’ll also give all the support that any patient requires as we move the patients from any part of the country to any other part. “We are working with the tertiary institutions on producing a ventilator and we have gone really far. We are the point of testing that ventilator on animals. There are various stages you have to go through before it is certified as good for use of human beings. And I have been briefed even as at this morning that we have been made substantial progress.” According to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control as of Thursday night, there were about 1000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria as well as over 30 fatalities.
