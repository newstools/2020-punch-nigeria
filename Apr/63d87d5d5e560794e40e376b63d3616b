Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State Government on Sunday denied sharing a bag of its stimulus relief package per street as being alleged on the social media. The government said it had yet to commence sharing and distribution of the packages in the affected areas. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Kunle Somorin, on Sunday in Abeokuta, accused politicians of being the mastermind of the allegation. The statement read “The sourcing and distribution of such unprecedented quantum of relief packages by our state couldn’t have proceeded without initial logistical issues. “There is, however, no doubting the fact that the Ogun State Government is determined to tower above all the attendant challenges.” Somorin said the social media had been awash with many videos and still images alleging that the packages were being distributed one bag per street or Community Development Area. He said, “This is untrue and deliberately spread in a bad light.” Somorin said the government package comprised a 5kg bag of rice, a 5kg of beans, 5kg of garri, sachets of tomato sauce, sachets of groundnut oil, noodles and pasta spices. Meanwhile, the governor explained that the 500,000 stimulus packages might not take care of everyone in the state but would reach many of the poor and the vulnerable. Abiodun said this while inspecting food and other relief materials at the state Central Food Bank, ahead of the stimulus package distribution across the state. He said he was on the visit to ensure quality assurance in content, bagging and logistics. The governor, however, declared that his administration would not condone any act of sabotage, exploitation or compromise, noting that “the exercise would be closely monitored.” Copyright PUNCH.
