Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The College of Nigerian Pathologists has raised the alarm over the community transmission of COVID-19 in some parts of the country. The college also raised concerns over its members working in laboratories across the country, saying they were directly exposed to the virus. The President of the CNP, Prof. Philip Olatunji, stated this during a press briefing at the secretariat of the Ogun State chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association, Abeokuta. Olatunji advised the Federal Government to localise contact tracing and bring it to the levels of states  and local government areas. The pathologist urged the government to provide personal protective equipment to health workers taking care of patients daily. He, however, announced that the CNP had donated N2m to the Federal Government COVID-19 welfare support fund. He pledged that members of the college would continue to carry out their civic and professional responsibilities in order for the country to overcome the plague. Olatunji said, “We will like to reiterate that those who are looking after the patients daily are at the greatest risks of exposure. They must not be starved of PPE and they must be adequately trained in doffing and donning all items of PPE.” Copyright PUNCH.
