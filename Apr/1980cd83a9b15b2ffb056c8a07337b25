Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Olowu of Owu Abeokuta, Oba Adegboyega Dosunmu; and a former world court judge,  Bola Ajibola, among other prominent people on Wednesday kicked against locating a COVID-19 isolation centre in the Obasanjo Hilltop, GRA, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, Ogun State. They said this in a petition by the Chairman of Olusegun Obasanjo Hilltop Residents Association II, Bishop Reuben Olu-Oke, claiming that the isolation centre would have a negative effect on the residents of the community. The Olowu, Ajibola and others petitioned Governor Dapo Abiodun over the donation of the property owned by a foremost banker, Fola Adeola, within the area as an isolation centre.
