Former Super Eagles winger Finidi George hopes to manage the team in the future. Finidi, 49, was a key member of the Super Eagles side that won the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations title in Tunisia. “We are ex-players, we are coaches, we had played this game and we know how to interact with players,” George told Brila FM. “We also know how to manage them which is important as well, so if the opportunity arises, I would take it with open hands. “I have been handling the youth players and it’s always good to do what you know how to do best, actually I have been an assistant coach in Mallorca.” George has also served as the director of international football at La Liga club Real Betis. He retired having played 62 games for the Super Eagles and scored six goals. Copyright PUNCH.
