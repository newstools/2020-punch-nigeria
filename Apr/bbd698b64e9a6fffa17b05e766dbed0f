For the third quarter of 2019, the company’s revenue grew by 7.2 per cent to N5.78bn from N5.39bn in the previous quarter. Profit before tax grew marginally by 0.2 per cent to N1.81bn.

Addressing shareholders at an AGM recently in Lagos, acting Chairman of CAP Plc, Mr Solomon Aigbavboa, said that the company increased marketing activities and value-adding services. “The company has successfully transited to ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certifications on Quality and Environmental Management Systems respectively. We will continue to offer high quality products and services to customers while complying with regulatory requirements in a healthy and safe environment,” he said. Speaking on the outlook, the chairman said, “The economy is expected to gain traction this year, on the back of stronger household consumption and public spending. The recent slide in oil prices and OPEC’s oil output cut pose downside risks going forward. “Macroeconomic variables must significantly improve in order for the country to fully recover from recession. Therefore, we expect that the economic environment will continue to be fluid and uncertain and businesses must be proactive and make clear-cut choices about how to compete in the market place.” Aigbavboa also said, “Businesses need to make clear definition of strategy, business model and core operations in order to increase revenue and profitability. “Your company is closely following developments at all levels and is prepared to key into opportunities that will be created. We are equally poised to take advantage of other structured reforms of the Federal Government, which might impact the housing and real estate sector.” He said the business would respond appropriately to the emerging paint market trends and different economy scenarios by opening new Dulux colour centres, business development, increasing volumes, just as he promised consistent engagement with professionals, completing the DCC upgrades, introducing new products and value-added services. Other things listed for implementation are launching virtual DCC; entrenching presence in the standard market; building people capabilities and implementing impactful marketing initiatives to ensure effective customer engagement.
