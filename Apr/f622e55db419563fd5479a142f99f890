Dayo Ojerinde The Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, Mr Babatunde Irukera, has said it was regrettable that the majority of the consuming public were ignorant of their health rights. Irukera said this during a two-day public inquiry held in Lagos to address the incessant deaths of people for lack of prompt medical intervention. “The majority of Nigerians are ignorant of their health rights under the FCCPC Act and the National Health Act. Members of the panel will consider all the complaints and materials submitted during the public inquiry and come out with solutions to the grey areas. “There is no doubt that people are beginning to learn how to do things differently. Listening to some of the experts during the two-day event, we have seen that there are still quality professionals in the health sector. We found out that some doctors are fighting very hard to deliver quality service with limited resources,” Irukera said. He urged hospitals in the country to prioritise patients’ care to improve the quality of health care and prevent avoidable deaths in the country. Irukera added that the public inquiry was organised for consumers and patients to understand their rights as well as to have knowledge of first aid method to give to trauma patients. Copyright PUNCH.
