Dele Ogunyemi, Warri Inmates of the Nigeria Correctional Service Centre in the Sapele Local Government Area of Delta State on Monday protested against a new policy by the Nigeria Correctional Services preventing visitors from the facilities. Our correspondent gathered that they were also aggrieved for not receiving Covid-19 palliatives and for not being considered during the visit by the Chief Judge of Delta State, Justice Marshal Mukoro. It was gathered that the aggrieved inmates demonstrated within the facility and allegedly burnt down vital documents belonging to the prison. The Delta State Comptroller of the Nigeria Correctional Service,  F. E. Ovie, in a telephone chat, confirmed that there was riot by the inmates at the facility. He said, “I’m on my way to the place. I cannot tell you this is what happened now until when I get there to know the cause of the riot.” The Delta State Commissioner of Police, Mr Mohammed Inuwa, in a text message said the report he received from the Divisional Police Officer was “that the inmates were demonstrating over the correctional service newly introduced policy preventing their loved ones from seeing them and non-consideration in the recent reprieves/visit by the CJ.” Copyright PUNCH.
