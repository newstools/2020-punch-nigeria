Tobi Aworinde, Abuja The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, on Tuesday, commended the Lagos State Police Command for the prosecution and conviction of high-profile violators of the lockdown order by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). This may not be unrelated to a birthday party organised by popular actress, Funke Akindele, aka Jenifa, and her musician husband, Abdul Rasheed Bello, at their Lagos home on Saturday, with over 20 attendees. The couple were, on Monday, sentenced to 14-day community service for violating the lockdown order. Similarly, the Lagos governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party in the 2019 governorship election, Babatunde Gbadamosi, and his wife, who were among the guests at the party, on Monday, reported at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Panti, Yaba, and were detained. Earlier, a musician, Azeez Fashola, aka Naira Marley, who also attended the party, turned himself in at the SCIID and was detained. The Chairman of the PTF and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, who spoke during a live briefing of the task force in Lagos, said no one is above the law. Mustapha said, “Reports have been received of the general level of satisfactory compliance in Lagos with the lockdown order and we have similarly received reports of violations. “In this case, I commend the governor of Lagos State with his institutions for the instant action of the government by prosecuting and convicting notable violators, which shows that nobody is above the law.”
