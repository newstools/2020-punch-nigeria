Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Electricity distribution companies are incurring losses as payment for electricity by consumers have been hampered by the restrictions of movement imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus, Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company has said. The Osun Regional Head, IBEDC, Mr Akin Ogunleye, disclosed this to our correspondent after making a donation of food items to Osun State Government on behalf of the company in Osogbo, the state capital. He, however, said that the Federal Government, through the National Assembly, had already commenced discussions with the Discos regarding palliatives to cushion the effect of nonpayment of bills by customers on them. He said, “The Federal Government, through the National Assembly, is already in some levels of discussions with Discos, not with the IBEDC alone. “We believe the Federal Government will come in to assist in whatever capacity to bring in some palliatives to cushion the effect of non-receipt of our revenue from our various customers.” Commenting on the donation, Ogunleye explained that it was part of the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility, saying the items were meant to cushion the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residents of Osun. According to him, the items donated include 3,000 bags of 5kg of rice; 3,500 bags of 1kg of Semovita and 40 cartons of noodles. Copyright PUNCH.
