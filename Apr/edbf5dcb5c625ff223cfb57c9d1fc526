Kayode Oyero Residents of Egbe Idimu Local Council Development Area in Lagos State were terrified on Easter Monday night over the presence of One Million Boys. The PUNCH reports that there have been multiple robberies and looting in the state in the past two weeks after the coronavirus lockdown. Our correspondent gathered that the hoodlums identified as members of the ‘One Million Boys’ gang operated at the Aiko Junction of Ogunrombi-Orisumbare Road in Idimu Monday night where they looted shops and bungled some homes around the Paiko, Ogunrombi and its environs. Our correspondent also learnt that the robbery operation occurred between 8pm and 10pm. An eyewitness told The PUNCH that one of the youths in the area was injured in the head while resisting the hoodlums. “The boys operated almost unhindered until some of the few brave youths in the area tried to deter the miscreants that came from Orisumbare to rob in Idimu,” the eyewitness said. After the incident, the youths formed a vigilante group, making bonfires and erecting all sorts of barricades within the area. Efforts to reach the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, proved abortive as of the time of filing this report.
