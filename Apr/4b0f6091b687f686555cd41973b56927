Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, in Rivers State, Chris Finebone, has disagreed with the state governor, Nyesom Wike, on the decision to replace the federal security agencies manning the state boundaries with a task force. Wike had on Monday announced that the state government would establish a task force to man the state boundaries due to the likelihood of sabotage from the police and other security agencies. But Finebone, in an interview in Port Harcourt on Wednesday, said, “It will be another misstep on the part of the governor to embark on such a dangerously ignorant line of action. “More so, it will amount to exposing innocent young men who will constitute the boundary task force to enormous danger. “Opening another flank of faceoff with the federal security agencies at this time is highly unnecessary. It is even more needless to create a situation that will endanger the lives of innocent young men in the name of task force on borders. “There is no doubt that our security agencies sometime falter when needed most, but that should not be a reason to resort to self-help. Let the governor continue to work with security agents towards enforcing boundary lockdown.” Copyright PUNCH.
