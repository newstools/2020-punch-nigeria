Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja The Director General of the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, Dr Abdulrazaq Garba, has called for thorough investigations into the recent explosion that occurred at Ilu Abo, near Akure in Ondo State. There were reports that the incident was caused by explosives loaded in a truck. However, there are also insinuations in some quarters that the explosion was an act of terrorism, while others have suggested that it was caused by a meteorite. In a statement in Abuja on Thursday, Garba lauded the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, for setting up a joint investigations team to probe issues surrounding the incident. Garba said the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency would support the investigation with its technical and human resources. He also said the investigation should be conducted scientifically, with the involvement of necessary stakeholders. According to him, a detailed report should be presented to the public at the conclusion of the investigations. Copyright PUNCH.
