Chima Azubuike, Gombe As positive cases in Gombe State hits 37, Governor Inuwa Yahaya, has banned commercial motorcycles operation in the state, while tricycle operators are ordered to carry only one adult passenger, among other stringent measures. He also banned congregation at mosques. The Chairman, Gombe State COVID-19 Task force, Prof. Idris Mohammed, said the measures were meant to reduce the spread of the virus. He said, “These cases were all imported from states with significant number of COVID-19 positive persons, such as Lagos, Ogun and Kano, as well as Abuja. “The major worry now is that those 37 cases may even be the tip of the iceberg; many might have slipped in without our knowledge. Such persons would have been mingling with other members of society thereby spreading the coronavirus.” Copyright PUNCH.
