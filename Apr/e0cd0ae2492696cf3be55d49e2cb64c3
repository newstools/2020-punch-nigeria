Ada Wodu, Calabar The Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade, has imposed new restrictions on residents of the state just as its neighbour, Akwa Ibom State, recorded its first set of cases. According to a statement signed by Ayade’s media aide, Christian Ita, no resident of the state would be allowed to move without a face mask starting Friday, April 3. The statement read in part, “No citizen or resident of the state will be allowed to leave home without a face mask from Friday 3rd, April 2020. “Failure to adhere to this directive will lead to the arrest and quarantine of the offenders for 14 days. “The Cross River State garment factory has been mandated to produce face masks to be freely distributed to citizens and residents alike to meet with the demand. “Those who for one reason or the other are unable to get masks from government before the new restrictions kick in, are advised to purchase theirs from shops selling the item.” The governor also stressed that all public gatherings remain banned and all markets closed except food markets. “All exit and entry points into the state are now completely shut. No human or vehicular movement will be allowed into the state under any disguise,” the statement concluded.
