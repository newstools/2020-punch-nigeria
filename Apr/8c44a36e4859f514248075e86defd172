Kayode Oyero The Nigeria Police Force said it has dismissed two of its officers caught on video flogging a lady, Azeez Alimat, for allegedly violating a coronavirus lockdown in Osun State. The Force in a statement on Friday via Twitter said the officers, Inspector Ikuesan Taiwo and Constable Abass Ibrahim, were found guilty of the crime upon investigation. The PUNCH had reported that the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, had described the action of his men as “unwarranted, unnecessary and unjustifiable assault”. Also, the Osun State Police Commissioner, Babatunde Kokumo, had said the two culpable officers were detained and had faced an orderly room trial. In an exclusive interview with Saturday PUNCH, Alimat explained that her two-year-old daughter suddenly took ill on the morning of Saturday, April 18. She said the lad had ear discharge which caused her discomfort and she had left the house to get a drug at a nearby pharmacy when she encountered the two officers. Alimat had tweeted the video showing her being brutalised by some policemen at Odo Ori market in Iwo area of the state. In the video, the two police officers were seen violently lashing onto Alimat with whips. But the Police while giving feedback on the investigation into the case of unprofessional conduct by the two officers, said, “Inspector Ikuesan Taiwo and Police Constable Abass Ibrahim captured in a viral video assaulting a woman in Osun State have been tried and found guilty. They have been dismissed from the Force. They will be arraigned in court for prosecution.”
