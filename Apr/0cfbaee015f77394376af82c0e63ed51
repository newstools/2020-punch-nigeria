Patrick Odey, Uyo Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, says the idea of random testing for COVID-19 in the state is a waste of government resources. Speaking at a media briefing held at government house on Monday, Udom said those who needed to be tested had been tested, noting that the state is acting in accordance with the guidelines of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. He said, “It would absolutely be a waste of resources if we go on random testing. Everyone who needed to be tested has been tested. Everything we do follows NCDC guidelines.” He disclosed that, so far, the state had collected and tested 84 specimens. He said what was required of everyone is co-operation and not anything that could weaken the efforts of the government in tackling the pandemic. “We are experiencing what the entire world has never experienced before, so no one can truly boast of experience. “COVID-19 has never happened before so everyone is learning to manage it. The best medical doctor may not be the best administrator,” the governor stated.
