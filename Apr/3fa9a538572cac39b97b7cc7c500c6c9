The two young men who lived in Obagaji had gone to Ologba and on their way back they were attacked by herdsmen who beheaded them. “The two young men have been buried without their heads because the herdsmen went away with their heads. About a week ago, two people were also attacked by herdsmen who are still in my clinic receiving treatment.” A former supervisory councillor in the local government, John Ikulono, confirmed the report. He said as soon as he got the report he informed the local government chairman who, he said, had gone to the area.
