Ted Odogwu, Kano Fire, on Sunday morning, razed the popular Rijiyan Lemu Katako Market on Zaria Road, Kano. The spokesman for the market, Shamsudeen Dawarure, who confirmed the incident, said the fire started around 2.30am and razed about 50 shops. Although the cause of the inferno has yet to be ascertained as of the time of filing this report, security operatives have been invited to keep watch over the market to forestall the pilfering of the goods. The local security guard on duty when the fire started has also been invited to give an account of the incident. However, the management of the market urged the state government to bail out those who lost their wares to the inferno, as majority of them were small-scale business operators. Copyright PUNCH.
