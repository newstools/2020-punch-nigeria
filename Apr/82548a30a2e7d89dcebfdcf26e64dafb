Dayo Ojerinde Airtel Nigeria has partnered mPharma to give Nigerians access to affordable and quality medicines. The Managing Director of Airtel Nigeria, Mr Segun Ogunsanya, in a statement on Monday, said the collaboration between the two firms gave birth to the ‘mutti’ loyalty reward programme. He said, “The wealth of a nation is dependent on the health of its people. Poor access to affordable medicines and health care is a major barrier to the economic growth of many countries in Africa. To bridge this gap, mPharma unveiled its loyalty rewards programme, ‘mutti’ designed to help people access quality medicines and health care services, with a focus on affordability, accessibility and availability. “On World Health Day 2020, Airtel is partnering with mPharma to offer its subscribers across Nigeria access to ‘mutti’ for free. Subscribers will receive a notification message and would be able to sign up to join ‘mutti’ and start enjoying the benefits.” The co-founder of mPharma, Mr Gregory Rockson, urged stakeholders in the Nigerian health sector to unite to provide Nigerians with quality, safe and affordable medicines. “There is no better time than now for all stakeholders to come together to fight for affordable cost of medicines and increasing access to quality medicines for all. In these uncertain times, we restate our commitment to our clients whose ability to access quality and affordable medicines will remain our priority,” Rockson said. He added that the ‘mutti’ subscribers would have access to quality medicines at affordable prices. Copyright PUNCH.
