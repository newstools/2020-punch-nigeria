Oladimeji Ramon The Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, has described as untrue claim that the test for COVID-19 in the state costs N30,000. He stressed that the test is conducted free-of-charge. A statement on Thursday by the Director, Public Affairs in the Lagos State Ministry of Health, Tunbosun Ogunbanwo, quoted the health minister to have said this in reaction to an online publication that people who presents themselves for COVID-19 test in Lagos are requested to pay N30,000. Abayomi warned against reports targeted at discrediting frontline health workers amid the battle against COVID-19. He said, “I want to state unequivocally that there is no designated COVID-19 testing centre in Lagos that collects or is allowed to collect money for COVID-19 test. Tests at the designated testing centres are free-of-charge. “I want to assure the public that activities at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba and other approved centres for COVID-19 screening are effectively monitored in accordance with the strict guidelines of the Lagos State COVID-19 Response, under which no fees are collected for the tests. “Furthermore, we urge Lagos State residents to call 08000CORONA to report any health worker and or anyone who demands and or requests fees to conduct COVID-19 tests at any of our designated testing centres.” The health commissioner, however, warned that any health worker found demanding payment for COVID-19 test or any other illegal activities would be sanctioned.
