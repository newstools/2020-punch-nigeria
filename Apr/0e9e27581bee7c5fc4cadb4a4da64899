Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt THE Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company has condemned the attack on one of its workers at its Akwa Ibom Zonal Office in Uyo by youths of Udotang Street in the state capital. PHED Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Henry Ajagbawa, who expressed shock over the incident, identified the victim as Sylvanus James. Ajagbawa said in a statement on Wednesday signed by the company’s Manager, Corporate Communications, Mr. John Onyi, that the victim was “mercilessly battered by the youths numbering over 30 when he was on routine duty along the street.” “James who can hardly speak from his hospital bed with a bandaged leg arising from a deep cut, could not ascertain why he was subjected to such inhuman act by the youths who are still unknown. “James set out for duty early that morning, checking out on those pre-paid customers, who have not made any electricity payment for almost one year on the street before he was physically assaulted with dangerous weapons by youths, culminating in the loss of his two mobile phones and other valuables.” Describing the incident, which occurred on Tuesday as a barbaric act, Ajagbawa stated that the victim was on a legitimate assignment, adding that a petition on the attack had been sent to the office of the Commissioner of Police, Akwa Ibom State Command. He vowed that he would use every legal means to ensure that the perpetrators were brought to book to serve as a deterrent to others, who might be nursing such an illicit act. “The performance of our employees and cooperation with customers are central to the success of service delivery; we will, as a matter of fact, not welcome any act of molestation, harassment, intimidation and physical assault on any staff,” the PHED boss said.
