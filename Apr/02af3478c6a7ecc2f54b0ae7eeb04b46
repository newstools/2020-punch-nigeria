Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The Ebonyi State Police Command, on Thursday, arrested over 33 minors, who engaged in fraud, attempted abortion and violated the social distancing order of the state government. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Loveth Odah, stated this while briefing journalists in Abakaliki, the state capital. Odah stated that the minors, both females and males, were caught in a one-room apartment, thereby violating the COVID-19 law and social distancing order of the Ebonyi State Government. According to her, the minors had stayed in the apartment for some days. Southern City News reports that the minors were arrested following a tip-off by a resident, who accused them of engaging in immoral acts in the one-room apartment. Police spokesperson said, “We arrested 33 children, they were 33 in one room. That is not their parents’ house. We asked them what they were doing in that one room. “They said that they were networking. And they are living in someone’s house. The owner of the house could not report to the police that such persons were in his place. Not until the police discovered through someone who reported to one of our police divisions. “The minors came from different states namely Ogun, Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Imo, Delta, Ekiti, and many others. Apart from FCT and two other states, it would have completed 36 States of the Federation in one room. “How can parents volunteer to allow their children of that age to leave their homes without them knowing their whereabouts? “It is worrisome that it is a mix-up of males and females staying together in one room. There was a rumour that one of the girls among them is pregnant and had taken a pregnancy pill to terminate it.”
