Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta the embattled  Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ogun State, Bayo Dayo, has accused former senator representing Ogun East Senatorial District, Buruji Kashamu, of attempting to bribe him with N10m to compromise the party congresses in the state. Dayo was suspended by the party in the state for alleged anti-party activities. While reacting to his suspension by some members of the executive of the party in the state, Dayo said he remained the party chairman because he could only be punished by National Executive Committee of the party. He said,  “They (Kashamu group) came to my house day before yesterday with N10m; they told me to take the money in order to sign their papers. “The paper is to withdraw the letter I wrote to the lawyer. I was also asked to write a letter to INEC telling them we have concluded the congresses of the state. “I resisted, I said I have written a letter to the lawyer that I do not need his services anymore because we are going to unite ourselves and I cannot sign the other letter telling INEC that we have concluded the congresses.

He said, “We have the evidence of the meeting at Equity Hotel, Ijebu Ode, where Dayo collected money to sell the Ogun State structures of the PDP to Kessington Adebutu. Copyright PUNCH.
