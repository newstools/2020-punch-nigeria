Ebenezer Bajela Inter Milan right-back, Victor Moses, has been named among the worst signings made by former Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers, during his time at the Anfield. Moses, 29, was signed from rivals Chelsea on a season long loan deal ahead of the 2013/14 season. Played in the left midfield role, Moses scored a goal in 19 appearances and in a list compiled by talkSPORT, the Nigerian was included alongside other players who failed to live up to expectations under the current Leicester City boss. His performance was not convincing enough to earn him a permanent stay with the Reds and the former Nigeria international returned to Chelsea. Commenting on Moses’ time at Anfield, talkSPORT.com wrote, “It seemed unthinkable for Chelsea to let a decent player in Moses play for rivals Liverpool on loan in the 2013/14 season. However, any concerned Chelsea fan needn’t have worried as Moses really struggled to make an impact in a season on Merseyside. “Moses scored on his Reds debut, a well-placed finish at Swansea, but that was his only goal for Liverpool. “Those slightly more obsessive Kopites will remember Moses essentially missing an open goal with a fresh air shot on that infamous ‘Crystanbul’ night where Liverpool blew a 3-0 lead to draw at Crystal Palace. “It was 3-3 when Moses missed but if that went in they would have won the match and maybe, just maybe, Liverpool could have lifted the title that season…” Other players on the list are Mario Balotelli, Christian Benteke, Alberto Moreno, Adam Bogdan, Javier Manquillo, Dejan Lovren, Tiago Ilori, Alberto Moreno, Luis Alberto, Nuri Sahin and Lazar Markovic Copyright PUNCH.
