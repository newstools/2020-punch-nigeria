Femi Makinde The management of the Ecobank Plc on Friday donated food items to support the Osun State government to mitigate the effects of the lockdown in the state. The Ecobank Head of Sales, Agric-business, Mr Donald Abe, while delivering the food items to the officials of the state government, said the gesture was aimed at complementing efforts of the  government during the period. He said the organisation was  motivated to reciprocate the warm relationship  it enjoyed with the government over the years. Abe, who led other officials of the bank to Osun to deliver the items commended the administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola for creating an enabling environment for commerce and industry to grow. He said, “On behalf of the executive team of Ecobank, we have seen this gesture as a corporate social responsibility to support the state government in its efforts to stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus. “We are aware of the lockdown in the state and we have come to deliver 1000 bags of rice  ( 5kg) and 560 bags of gari (5kg) as a token to complement the efforts of the state government at this critical moment. “No doubt, the state government of Osun has done a lot for us and for the people of the state and this is a little way to reciprocate the kind gesture that we have received from the state government.
