Ebenezer Bajela Nigerians Cyriel Dessers and Chidera Ejuke have been included in the Dutch Eredivisie Team of the Season after the league was brought to an abrupt end following the decision by the Dutch government to ban all sporting events until September, due to the coronavirus outbreak. Both players were impressive for their respective clubs in the 2019-2020 season, which was recently cancelled by the KNVB. Heracles Almelo striker Dessers was named the joint top scorer of the league along with Feyenoord’s Steven Berghuis , as both players scored 15 goals each, while Ejuke contributed nine goals for his club, SC Heerenveen. In a publication by nederlands-voetbal, with a favoured 4-3-3 formation, the Nigerians were joined by Berghuis at the front. Explaining why both players were preferred in their positions, the website wrote, “Cyriel Dessers in Almelo in recent months, almost every shot was a hit. “Chidera Ejuke (SC Heerenveen), Okay, Bryan Linssen, Quincy Promes and Oussama Idrissi scored more often. But the most attractive left winger of the Premier League really played football at SC Heerenveen this season. So, Chidera Ejuke, good example of scouting work by the Frisians.” Copyright PUNCH.
