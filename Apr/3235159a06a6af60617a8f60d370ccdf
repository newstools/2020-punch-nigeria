Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Bayelsa State Government has said it can no longer sustain the welfare of Internally Displaced Persons from Peremabiri community in the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of the state. It subsequently announced plans to suspend its policy on the management of the IDPs “to promote peace and stability.” The state Deputy Governor, Mr. Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, said this during the weekly meeting with chairmen of the local government councils at the Government House, Yenagoa. In a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Mr Doubara Atasi, Ewhrudjakpo was quoted as saying, “Government should not be held responsible for the welfare of people who are displaced by unnecessary crises and crimes perpetrated by criminals shielded by the communities.” He added that the state would soon direct the Southern Ijaw Local Government Council to stop giving relief packages to people displaced from Peremabiri community during the 2015 governorship elections. The deputy governor said the measure would not only serve as a deterrent but also “promote the spirit of resilience and self-reliance which the Ijaw man is known for.” Ewhrudjakpo added, “Well, for this month, I have asked Southern Ijaw to pay the Peremabiri IDPs. But I don’t think that is what we should continue to do. It is a way of making that community people not to return to their community.” Copyright PUNCH.
