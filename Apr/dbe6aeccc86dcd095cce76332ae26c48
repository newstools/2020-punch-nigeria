The source said, “There was a hot argument between the man (suspect) and his wife and the argument led to fisticuffs.  The man started punching the wife until she fell down and became unconscious. “Immediately after that, she was rushed to the hospital but it was at the hospital that the doctor confirmed her dead.” READ ALSO: Osun Councillor using facebook to attack Oyetola arrested The source added that the remains of the deceased had been deposited at the General Hospital in Idanre.
