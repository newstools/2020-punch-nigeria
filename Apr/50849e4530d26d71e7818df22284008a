Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki Ebonyi State Government, has commenced the production of 200,000 face masks, to be distributed to residents, as part of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus disease in the State. The Special Assistant to Governor David Umahi on Vocational Education, Adaeze Nwaji, who disclosed this to journalists in Abakaliki, on Tuesday, said government took the decision after observing that masks were becoming scarce and costly in the state. She said, the Governor had directed the department of Pre-vocational Studies, School of Human Aesthetics and Fashion Designing, to immediately produce at least 200,000 face masks for distribution to the populace. Nwaji said, “Our dear Governor, Chief David Umahi has directed Ebonyi State Vocational College to produce two hundred thousand (200,000) face masks for the people of the state.” This is coming barely 24 hours after Umahi directed that that all residents of the state weak protective masks at all times. He also directed security operatives and the Anti-coronavirus taskforce to arrest defaulters. This Commissioner for Information and State Orientation, who doubles as the acting Commissioner for Human Capital Development and Monitoring, Mr. Uchenna Orji, said this in a statement. He said, “Effective from 4th of April, 2020 and throughout the entire Ebonyi State, anybody that is seen outside his or her house must wear a face mask. Note that Handkerchief/Head tie/pre-made medical mask could serve the purpose of face mask.” Copyright PUNCH.
