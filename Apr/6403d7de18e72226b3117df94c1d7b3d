Nike Popoola Paga, the payments company with operations in Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Mexico, says it has been selected for the 4th Cohort of the Ping An Cloud Accelerator, China. A statement said the five-month programme was created by Ping An Group, one of the world’s largest insurance and financial institutions with headquarters in Shenzhen, China. The General Manager, Ping An Cloud Accelerator, Jerry Quan, stated, “We are excited to have Paga as part of our current cohort for the programme. “Their goal of building formidable emerging markets focused payments business resonates with us, and we are impressed with their progress to date. “There are many opportunities to build synergies with Ping An’s technology subsidiaries and external corporate partners, and our engagement with the Paga team thus far has been great. “I expect that this is the start of larger collaborations to come between our organisations.” The statement said Paga was selected alongside 10 other companies from across the world including China, the United States, Spain, and Israel. It stated that this highly selective programme with an acceptance rate of only two per cent, focused on five verticals which were FinTech, healthTech, auto tech, real estate tech, and smart city. Participating companies in the Ping An Cloud Accelerator were growth-stage businesses that would explore collaborations with Ping An subsidiaries, it stated. Ping An’s advanced FinTech arm, OneConnect, that offered solutions in the areas of eKYC, fraud prevention, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, identified the synergy in objectives of both companies and the opportunity to work together.
