Ebenezer Bajela Rivers United coach, Stanley Eguma, says the League Management Company shouldn’t hand Nigeria Professional Football League leaders Plateau United the league, insisting the league is not over yet. Plateau are currently top of the 20-team table with 49 points from 25 matches, closely followed by Rivers United, who are four points behind the leaders. But the league was suspended on March 18 due to the coronavirus outbreak, thus sparking reactions that the LMC take a decision on the suspended season. While some have called on the league body to cancel the season, some others suggested that Plateau should be handed the 2019/20 NPFL title. Plateau United gaffer, in an interview with The PUNCH on Thursday, said, “I think it will be fair to hand us the NPFL title.” But Eguma, whose side still have a chance of becoming champions, urged the LMC not to rush into taking any decision. “It will be too early to start rushing and say the trophy should be handed to Plateau United because the league is not over,” Eguma told The PUNCH. “I will not want them to go ahead and hand over the trophy to Plateau United, but if the Nigeria Football Federation, in conjunction with the LMC, decide to do that, no problem. “I think we should allow this problem (coronavirus) go before we move on. If they (Plateau) are named champions and the problem is still there, it does not make it right. The most important thing is to allow this transition period to pass by.” Copyright PUNCH.
