Ebenezer Bajela Lille striker Victor Osimhen’s proposed move to Manchester United could hit a stumbling block should Chilean, Alexis Sanchez, make a return to the Old Trafford. The Red Devils have been a strong admirer of the Nigeria international and have been linked with a move for the striker ahead of the summer transfer window. But according to Le10 Sport, such switch has met an obstacle and may not materialise as Sanchez is set to return to the club at the end of the season. The former Barcelona striker has struggled to impress since his loan move to Inter Milan, scoring just once in 15 matches across all competitions. With Inter making it known that they are not willing to trigger the option of keeping the Chilean beyond this summer because of his poor form, the French publication said it could prove to be the stumbling block for Osimhen. “Inter Milan have already announced that they do not wish to exercise the purchase option of the Chilean striker, on loan from Manchester United, which amounts to €20m,” the website wrote. “However, the Chilean will return to the club, which could jeopardise the arrival of Victor Osimhen, which could cost around €100m.” Osimhen was in impressive form for Lille before the suspension of the league due to the coronavirus pandemic, scoring 18 goals in 38 games.
