Kayode Oyero The Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Muhammed Babandede, has said being infected with coronavirus is a humbling experience. Babandede, who spoke from isolation for the first time since he told The PUNCH that he tested positive for COVID-19 upon his return from the UK on March 22, said Nigerians should pray that the number of cases in the country doesn’t explode further. In a video he released on Wednesday night, the immigration boss said people all over the country, especially kinsmen from his village, have been gracious with their prayers and show of love towards him. He said, “Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I will like to thank all my friends, loved ones, officers and men, Muslims and Christians in Nigeria and abroad for the enormous prayers for my quick recovery. I am very grateful for your prayers. In reality, your prayers are helping me recover very quickly. “I thank Allah for giving me the opportunity to be sick because it gives me the opportunity to humble myself, to also know that I am loved by such a large number of people. “Today, the 1st of April, I am sending this short video to you to tell you I’m doing well and recovering gradually. “Please take care always, wash your hands and maintain social distance. “Continue to pray that Nigeria does not head towards any disaster. The numbers are still small but continue to pray that it does not grow. “I send my love to you, especially people from my village – people from Kano, Lagos, Abuja, everywhere I can’t even mention. Thank you for your love. Maa Salam.” Nigeria has recorded over 170 cases of COVID-19 and two attendant deaths. Lagos and Abuja, the two cities with the highest number of patients, are currently observing a 14-day lockdown while Ogun State would commence its own effective Friday as part of measures to curb the community transmission of the virus which has infected over 900,000 people globally.
