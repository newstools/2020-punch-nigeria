Femi Makinde The President-General of Yoruba World Congress, Prof Emeritus Banji Akintoye, has said the Yoruba nation has been accepted as the 45th member of the Unrepresented Nations and People’s Organisation. Akintoye, who is a Second Republic senator, announced this in a statement issued on Tuesday by the Director of Media and Communications of the  YWC, Maxwell Adeleye. Akintoye said the UNPO, in a letter addressed to him through the YWC Coordinator for Europe by her Secretary-General, Ralph Bunche, expressed his gladness to welcome the Yoruba nation as a new member of the organisation and that the UNPO was looking forward to working closely with the Yoruba people. The president-general said the recognition by the UNPO was the first stage towards self-determination, saying this represented a very important step in the quest of Yoruba to achieve dignity and self-determination. When contacted on the telephone by our correspondent for further clarification, Akintoye said Yoruba were not planning to secede but said Nigeria must be properly restructured to enable all ethnic groups to exercise their rights. He said, “What we are doing is the educated man’s approach to matters.  We will continue to pray that Nigeria mends  its ways and remains a country as well.” Copyright PUNCH.
