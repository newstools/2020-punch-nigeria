AFEEZ HANAFI A pipe constructed by suspected oil vandals to siphon fuel from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation pipeline at Aboru, Lagos State, has been uncovered. The illegal pipe was discovered on Saturday after residents raised the alarm over leakage from the NNPC pipeline in the area. A team comprising officials of the NNPC, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency and the Lagos State Fire Service, was said to have mobilised to the spot. The incident happened barely one week after a major leakage from the NNPC on Alhaji Moriamo Street, Satellite Town. LASEMA General Manager, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyitolu, in his situation report, stated that the NNPC repair team had fixed the leakage at Aboru. He urged members of the public to report such cases promptly to avert disaster. He said, “Around 8am on Saturday, we were informed of uncontrolled leakage of PMS (petrol) along NNPC Pipeline in Aboru off Cacateen Road. Consequently, LASEMA responders were deployed and it was discovered that the leakage was from a major NNPC pipeline which had been tampered with through an illegal set up designed to continuously divert and siphon fuel. “The NNPC repair team has secured the pipe and the leakage has been addressed. We have urged well meaning members of the public to report anonymously these unsavory elements who are endangering lives and property for selfish purposes.” Copyright PUNCH.
