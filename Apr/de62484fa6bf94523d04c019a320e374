Ebenezer Bajela Nigerian wrestler Odunayo Adekuoroye admits it is difficult combining sports and education as an athlete due to the stance of some of the country’s higher institutions. The 57kg world No. 1 told The PUNCH that it would have been easier to combine both if the country’s athletes were given some consideration. “I would have loved to further my education because I thought I could just finish the Olympics and go back to school, but since they’ve postponed the Olympics to 2021, I have not decided if I will be going to school now or not. “It is possible (to combine sports and education) but in Nigeria they make things too hard for you to combine. Imagine you have a competition and the federation already wrote a letter to the school that you won’t be around when an examination is going on. Some lecturers will make you carry over such courses instead of making you sit for the exams again. So, it practically makes combining sports and education difficult but not impossible. “There are some schools that encourage sports, for instance the University of Port Harcourt. I heard they encourage their athletes but I live and train in Akure, so going to Port Harcourt will be something else. And I cannot even train without my coach because we’ve been together from day one.” Adekuoroye booked a spot at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games after reaching the semi-finals of the Senior World Wrestling Championships in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan in September 2019.
