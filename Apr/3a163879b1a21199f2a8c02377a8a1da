Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has vowed tough consequences for members of the organised transport sector who continued to breach the existing restriction order by resorting to night travels. He said the violation undermined the efforts of the Federal Government at curbing the spread of the COVID-19 disease. The Force Spokesman, DCP Frank Mba, said the warning was sequel to intelligence at the disposal of the force showing that road transport workers, especially interstate operators, have continued to defy the lockdown order and cessation of movement ordered by the FG. “Consequently, the IG has directed Commissioners of Police to ensure full implementation of the restriction order, especially as it relates to night travel without being unmindful of categories of exempted persons and the fundamental human rights of Nigerians,” Mba disclosed in a statement on Wednesday. The IG restated that the lockdown was for 24 hours daily, noting that night hours were not excluded. He called on the leadership of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria and the Public Transport Owners of Nigeria Association, amongst others, to caution their members to strictly adhere to the restriction order of the Federal Government, warning that “violators will be made to face the full wrath of the law”.
