Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo There was palpable tension on Wednesday in Unity School Ejigbo, Osun State, where about 127 returnees from Côte d’Ivoire were kept in isolation following alleged threat by them to leave the facility. Many of the returnees, especially the indigenes of Ejigbo town, had insisted that they were not sick and demanded that they should be allowed to go home. Out of the 127 that arrived at the centre last Saturday, 12 had already tested positive for coronavirus, while result of samples of 56 others were still being expected. The PUNCH learnt crises started when soldiers manning the facility reportedly vacated the premises. Those in the isolation were said to have subsequently attempted to leave the premises, but for the arrival of policemen from Ejigbo division, who prevented them from leaving. The Police Public Relations Officer for Osun Command, Yemisi Opalola, said the situation was under control. Opalola said the state Commissioner of Police, Johnson Kokumo, had sent a unit of riot policemen to the facility. She said, “The situation is under control. The police commissioner is even planning to visit the facility as we talk now. He has detached unit of Mobile Police Force to the facility. No cause for concern.” Speaking in similar vein, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Ismail Omipidan, confirmed that security in the isolation centre had been fortified. Copyright PUNCH.
