Jesusegun Alagbe In a bid to support the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, Living Faith Church Worldwide, aka Winners Chapel International, said it had donated a brand new ambulance to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. While making the delivery on Thursday, the church said the ambulance, which could serve as a mobile hospital, had the capacity for testing and treating COVID-19 patients. The church said it also donated ventilators, hand gloves, face masks, infrared thermometers, personal protective equipment, pulse oximeter, and blood pressure monitor. “This donation is part of the church’s phased and continuous support to manage the health situation of the country in general and rid Nigeria of the COVID-19 in these trying times,” said a statement by Prof Sheriff Folarin, the Chairman, Editorial and Media Board, Living Faith Church Worldwide. Stating that the initiative was part of the church’s humanitarian gestures, the church said it would continue to render medical, material and spiritual support to the government and the people of Nigeria to guarantee a sane and healthy country. “The church will not relent in offering help and partnering with government at all levels and other responsible organisations to fight and defeat COVID-19 and other challenges facing the country,” Folarin added. As of the time of filing this report on Friday, Nigeria had recorded 190 coronavirus cases, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Twenty patients had recovered and discharged while two had died. Lagos State, FCT and Osun State had the highest number of cases at 98, 38 and 20, respectively. Copyright PUNCH.
