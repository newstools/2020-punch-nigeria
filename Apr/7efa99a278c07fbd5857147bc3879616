Out of these 73 cases, some do not have history of travel and cannot remember who travelled and came in contact with them. There is evidence of community transmission of COVID-19 in Kano State,” he said. Meanwhile, the state government on Friday repatriated another batch of 155 to Kaduna State as part of its renewed effort to check the spread of COVID-19 in the state. The Commissioner of Education, Alhaji Sanusi Kiru, said, “As I am talking to you now, we are on our way to Kaduna where we will hand them over to the state government for onward transportation to their respective towns and villages. From Kaduna we are going to four other states, including Bauchi, Gombe, Yobe and Zamfara,” Kiru said.
