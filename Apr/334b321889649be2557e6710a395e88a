Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin The Emir of Ilorin and Chairman, Kwara State Council of Chiefs, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, has cancelled all programmes lined up for the celebration of his 80th birthday. Sulu-Gambari will clock 80 years on Wednesday. But the monarch has directed the cancellation of all social or religious gatherings to that effect. A statement on Monday by the Emir’s media aide, Mallam Abdulazeez Arowona, said no congregational prayers should be held as usual in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. He noted that the cancellation of the annual birthday prayers in the Emir’s palace was part of measures towards supporting government’s efforts in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 infection in the state.
