Kelvin Ekerete US Monastir striker, Anthony Okpotu,, says in order to put a lasting stop to recurring violence in the Nigeria Professional Football League, the League Management Company must caution club chairmen. Okpotu was top scorer in the NPFL with 19 goals while playing for Lobi Stars in 2017, before joining Moroccan side Difaâ Hassani El Jadidi. The Nigerian was recently voted the best striker in Tunisia and the best foreign player in the league after scoring 11 goals in 16 appearances. “The LMC must caution club chairmen because they are the ones who are always pushing the thugs to attack referees, harass away team,” Okpotu said. The striker also tasked match referees to be fair and fearless while officiating games in the league. “Also the referees have to be sincere with themselves if they want the league to grow.” Copyright PUNCH.
