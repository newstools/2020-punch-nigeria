Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Government has commenced investigation into the circumstances that led to the death of a woman, Oluremi Esan, during childbirth at the Epe General Hospital. PUNCH Metro had reported that Oluremi’s husband, Ayobami Taiwo, had accused health workers in the hospital of negligence, which he said led to his wife’s death. Taiwo had alleged that the doctor and nurses on duty abandoned his wife after she was referred on emergency to the hospital by the Epe Primary Health Centre. According to him, it was discovered during a scan on April 13, 2020, that Oluremi had placenta previa and a Caesarean Section needed to be performed to save her life and that of the baby. The pastor had told PUNCH Metro that when he refused to buy a partially used delivery kit that was claimed would be needed for the operation from the nurses, his wife was left unattended to by the medical team. The grieving husband, however, told our correspondent on Wednesday that a director with the Lagos State Health Service Commission contacted him and said an investigation had commenced into the matter. He stated, “Someone called me from the health service commission and said that they read my story in The PUNCH and that they had swung into action. “She said that they had summoned the doctor and nurses involved, who are expected to report at the commission’s office to put in writing what they know about the incident.” When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the state Ministry of Health, Tunbosun Ogunbanwo, told our correspondent that the ministry had also commenced an investigation into the incident. “We are investigating the matter,” he simply said.
