Tukur Muntari, Kano Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, on Monday, extended the stay-at-homeâ€™ order for civil servants in the state for another two weeks. Ganduje gave the directive while receiving the progress report from the 40-member Kano COVID-19 Fund Raising Committee under the leadership of the Vice Chancellor of Bayero University Kano, Prof. Muhammad Yahuza Bello. The governor directed civil servants to remain at home for additional two weeks. He said the decision to extend the order was aimed at avoiding unnecessary outbreak or spread of the deadly coronavirus in the state. Ganduje, who received the committee at the Government House, commended the members for a job well done. Kano State remains free from the deadly coronavirus as it has not recorded a single case so far. Ganduje said the extension of the two weeks compulsory holiday was also necessary following his determination to ensure that all proactive measures were put in place to avoid the outbreak of the disease in the state. He, however, appealed to Kano residents to strictly adhere to directives from the Federal Ministry of Health and the state government in order to stay safe. Ganduje also maintained that the boundary closure order would remain valid, promising residents that his administration will do everything possible to combat the deadly virus in the state.
