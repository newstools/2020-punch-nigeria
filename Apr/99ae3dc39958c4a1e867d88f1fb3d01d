Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Mainstream Energy Solution Limited has provided N500m worth of medical support to the Federal Capital Territory, Niger State and selected communities in other states. MESL is the operator of Kainji and Jebba hydropower plants located in Niger State. For the FCT, the Managing Director of the power generation firm, Lamu Audu, said MESL provided medical supplies to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada. He said the Genco provided medical equipment such as ventilators, ECG machines and hematology analysers to the COVID-19 isolation centre of the Niger State Government. He said the commitment by his firm would further boost the federal and state governments’ efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 across the country. Audu said the medical and personal protective equipment would benefit the selected front-line institutions dealing with the pandemic. Speaking at the teaching hospital in Abuja, Audu said, “We will also be intervening in other states and all these will be through our corporate social responsibility vehicle, Mainstream Foundation.” The power firm stated that it was fully aware of the threat that the novel coronavirus had posed to the global healthcare and economic systems including Nigeria. “We are keen to play our role as a responsible corporate citizen to assist the nation’s response against the global pandemic,” Audu stated. He said the funds were used to provide equipment for use in the isolation ward of the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital such as X-Ray machines, digitisers, personal protective equipment, CT scans and 350KVA generator.
