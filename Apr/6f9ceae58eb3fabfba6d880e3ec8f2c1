Matthew Ochei, Asaba The Delta State Chairman, Inter-party Advisory Council, Mr Afam Enemokwu, has faulted the Delta State Government’s distribution of COVID-19 palliatives. Enemokwu, who is also the State Chairman of All Progressive Grand Alliance, in a statement in Asaba on Wednesday, said, members of the ruling Peoples Democractic Party hijacked food items meant for the most vulnerable in the state. He said, “Governor Ifeanyi Okowa did not include all interest groups in the committee. “The sharing process was hijacked by the PDP and at the end, the vulnerable people could not get the food items.” Also, the state Chairman, African Democratic Congress, Joe Chukwu, accused the state government of failing to fulfil its promise to ameliorate the sufferings of Deltans through the distribution of food items as palliatives. Governor Ifeanyi Okowa had promised that political party affiliation would not be used as basis for sharing the palliatives. Copyright PUNCH.
