Peter Dada, Akure Ondo State has recorded another case of the deadly coronavirus disease as a corps member, whose identity has not been revealed has contracted the disease. It was gathered that the corps member was a medical doctor, having his primary assignment, at the 32 Artillery Brigade, Owena Cantonment, and reportedly had contact with the index case. Confirming the development in a statement, Tuesday morning, the state Commissioner for Information, Mr Donald Ojogo, said the third victim was a corps member and medical doctor. He said, “The third positive case in Ondo State is a medical doctor; he is a Youth Corp member attached to the Army Clinic at the Barracks and had attended to the first index case while he was under observation. “Mr. Governor will today at noon, address the people of the state on further details in respect of this case and provide deeper insights.” Meanwhile, the governor in a series of tweets on Tuesday debunked that the patient is a serving corps member. He said, “Infected person is not a current National Youth Service Corps – NYSC corps member as stated online. The individual was an ex corps member that served in the hospital where the index case was identified and was retained. “As it is typical for all cases, all protocols for contact tracing have been activated with those closest to the new case kept in isolation for observation.”
