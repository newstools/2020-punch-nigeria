He tweeted, “Today, four more patients; all male, including an 11-year-old boy have been discharged from the Lagos State Isolation facilities to reunite with society.” Sanwo-Olu, however, appealed to Lagos residents to stay at home and practice social distancing. “I appeal to residents to stay at home, practice #SocialDistancing and observe the highest possible personal and hand hygiene. We are on a steady course to victory, let’s all make little sacrifices for the greater good,” he said.
