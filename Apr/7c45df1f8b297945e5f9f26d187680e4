Those dying in Kano are Nigerians and must not be abandoned. The development deserves utmost presidential attention to avoid further escalation.” The PDP spokesman said an immediate investigation into the mass death in Kano State was imperative. He stated that the party’s call was predicated on conflicting reports emanating from Kano State on the cause of the sudden deaths particularly at a time that Nigeria is battling with the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.
