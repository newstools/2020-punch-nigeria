Nike Popoola Displeased depositors of different banks demanded a total of N352.95bn and $423.83m from their banks over disputes since inception of the Ethics and Professionalism Division of the banking industry in 2011 to December 2019. The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria disclosed this in its 2019 annual report. According to the CIBN, the Ethics and Professionalism Division continued to play a pivotal role in the banking industry in Nigeria, in line with the mandate of the Bankers’ Committee, Subcommittee on Ethics & Professionalism in resolving disputes relating to unethical and unprofessional infractions between banks as well as between banks and their customers. Part of the report read, “Since inception in 2001, the subcommittee had received a total number of 2,154 petitions and cases with total claims of N352.95bn and $423.83m in local and foreign currencies respectively; out of which it had resolved 2,049 cases with N31.36bn and $19.04m awarded or refunded to petitioners/ customers by banks.” The report said the displeased depositors of different banks claimed amounts totalling N89.94bn and $10.22m from banks between the 2015 and 2019 financial periods. After interventions by the Ethics and Professionalism Division, N15.59bn and $2.25m were awarded to the complainants in the cases, it disclosed. According to the report, the division received 526 cases and resolved 493 cases in the five-year periods under review. It added that there were 62 petitions with petitioners claims amounting to about N10.8bn in 2019 alone, while 68 cases were fully resolved with a total of N1.2bn refunded to the petitioners. While noting the bank customer-related cases which were brought to the committee for resolution, the report said the Nigerian judicial system recognised the mediation roles of the institute, and had continued to refer cases to it for unbiased independent, professional opinion so as to facilitate delivery of judgment on those cases. It added that 17 of such cases had been received to date out of which the report of 12 cases had been concluded and forwarded to the parties and the courts. Copyright PUNCH.
