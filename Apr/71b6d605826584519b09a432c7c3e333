One hundred Italian doctors have died of the novel coronavirus since the pandemic reached the Mediterranean country in February, Italy’s FNOMCeO health association said on Thursday. “The number of doctors who have died because of COVID-19 is 100 – perhaps even 101 at the moment, unfortunately,” a FNOMCeO spokesman told AFP. The toll includes retired doctors the government began calling in a month ago to help fight a coronavirus that has officially claimed a world-topping 17,669 lives in Italy.
