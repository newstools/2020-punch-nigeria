Raphael Ede, Enugu The Enugu State chapter of the All Progressives Congress on Sunday decried the level of hunger in the land as a result of the lockdown, a measure both Federal and state governments put in place to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Addressing journalists shortly after distributing food items which include rice, yam, eggs, oil to 260 wards in the state to the poor and vulnerable families, the Chairman of the party in Enugu, Dr Ben Nwoye, said the state had no Covid-19 but had what he described as “a hunger epidemic,” adding that it would kill more Nigerians than the virus itself if urgent measures were not taken to address it now. Nwoye, who accused the Federal Government of marginalising Enugu State, explained that no single person had benefited from the Federal Government palliative, challenging those in-charge to publish the beneficiaries of the Cash Transfer Programme in the state. He appealed to the people of the state to unite to provide palliative for the poor residents who could hardly provide two square meals a day for their families, adding that the fight against Covid-19 should not be politicised, “as hunger doesn’t know whether you’re APC or PDP.” Copyright PUNCH.
