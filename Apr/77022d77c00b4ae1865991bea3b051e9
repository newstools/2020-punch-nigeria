James Abraham, Jos The family of one Samuel Ponjul, a petty trader in the Abattoir community, Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State, have demanded the release of their son. It was learnt that Samuel, who has a provisions shop in the community, was detained by the police for allegedly allowing his dog to bite an officer during an arrest in the neighbourhood. Samuel’s brother, Jerry, told our correspondent in Jos on Monday that since the incident happened on Saturday, his brother had been in detention. “What happened was that the police came to arrest somebody in front of our shop in the Abattoir area. As they were passing with the suspect, the dog, which belongs to my brother, bit one of the policemen,” Jerry stated. He said his brother was later invited and was detained at the station in the Angul ‘D’ area. Jerry stated, “The policemen at the Angul ‘D’ area later invited my brother to the station. When they asked him if he was the owner of the dog, he said yes and presented the licence for the dog. But they demanded money for the treatment of the officer, which he provided, but he was not allowed to go and was detained at the station. “When I got to the station, they told me that my brother would not be released unless he bailed himself with N50,000. We want the police to release him, because he has not committed any offence.” When contacted, the spokesman for the state police command, ASP Ubah Ogaba, said he had yet to be briefed on the matter, adding, “It is easy for members of the public to make allegations that usually turn out to be untrue against our officers.” Copyright PUNCH.
