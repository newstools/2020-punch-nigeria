Raphael Ede, Enugu The Academic Staff Union of Research Institutions, on Tuesday attacked the French doctors that proposed that Africa should be a testing ground for “untested” COVID-19 vaccine. A statement by ASURI’s Secretary General, Dr Theophilus Ndubuaku, stated that Africa had not been the worst hit by COVID-19, advising the doctors that “if there is anywhere these vaccines should be tested, charity should begin at home.” The statement read, “We join our voices with African football stars of Samuel Eto’o and Didier Drogba in condemnation of the racist vituperations of certain French doctors who have proposed that Africa becomes a testing ground for “untested” COVID-19 vaccine. “The World Health Organisation has reiterated the point that Africa would not be a  testing ground for some racist doctors’ vaccine from France.” While commending governments at various levels for their response towards the fight against the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, ASURI appealed that the health care system should be strengthened to cater for eventualities like the coronavirus epidemic. It asked the Federal Government to revisit the National Research and Innovation Council Bill which it said would give Nigeria “a Nigerian solution to Nigerian problems.” Copyright PUNCH.
