Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, has ordered the arrest of the traditional rulers of Umuogodoakpu-Ngbo and Ohankwu communities in the  Ohaukwu and Ikwo local government areas of the state. The order came over the missing of a naval officer and the killing of a 70-year-old woman in both communities. The governor also ordered the arrest of the coordinators of the Ohaukwu West and Ikwo East development centres, Stephen Ogenyi and Mr Ekuma  Emmanuel, respectively, both in Ohaukwu and Ikwo LGAs over the two incidents. Umahi, who stated this during his Easter broadcast, equally suspended the technical assistants, senior technical assistants, executive assistants, liaison officers, management committee members and other appointees from both communities. Recall that a naval officer got missing at Eguorie village. A 70-year-old woman was also allegedly killed by Ohankwu people of the Ikwo LGA of the state.
