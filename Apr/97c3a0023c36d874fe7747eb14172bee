Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti An Ado Ekiti Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday convicted two pastors, Abiodun Daramola and Sunday Akinwande, for violating the lockdown order of the state government. The Magistrate, Mr Lanre Owoleso, who found the clerics guilty of the two counts preferred against them, ordered them to pay N50,000 fine each and as well as engage in one hour community service each. The two pastors were charged for conducting a religious gathering of more than 30 persons on Sunday, contrary to the stay-at-home order of the Ekiti State Government and the order prohibiting gatherings of more than 20 persons. The state Prosecutor, Mr Femi Onipede, told the court that “the two pastors committed the offence on April 19 at the Source of Salvation Ministries, Omisanjana in Ado-Ekiti in Ado-Ekiti Magisterial District without lawful excuse.” Copyright PUNCH.
