Rasheed Bisiriyu Representative of Mitsubishi Motors in Nigeria, Massilia Motors, has provided food items to feed members of about 1,000 homes in Ijora, a suburb of Lagos State, where the company’s head office is located. A statement by the company obtained by our correspondent on Monday said a Massilia Motors team led by its Deputy Managing Director, Mr Kunle Jaiyesimi, handed over the food items to the Ojora of Ijora, Oba Abdulfatai Aromire. It listed the food items as bags of rice, beans, sugar, salt, vegetable oil, pasta and tomato paste. Jaiyesimi commended the efforts of the government in checking the spread of COVID-19 in the country, noting that the company’s gesture “is a way of alleviating the hardship the COVID-19 lockdown may have on the people in our neighbouring community.” The firm recalled in the statement that President Muhammadu Buhari had imposed the stay-at-home order on residents of Lagos and Ogun states as well as the Federal Capital Territory as a measure to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. Masilia Motors, a joint venture of CFAO and Chanrai Group, according to the statement, is focused on automotive needs in Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH.
