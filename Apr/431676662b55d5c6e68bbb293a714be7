Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has sacked his Special Assistant on Youths and Students Affairs, Banji Adewumi, for alleged dereliction of duty. Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Olusegun Ajiboye, in a statement on Friday in Akure, said Adewumi was relieved of his appointment because he abandoned his responsibilities. He said, “It was recently discovered that Adewumi has abandoned the office and his responsibilities for some months now and that he is no longer resident in the country.
