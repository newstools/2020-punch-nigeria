Afeez Hanafi The sacked lecturer at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Richard Akindele, has been released from prison after serving a two-year term. It was learnt that the lecturer, a professor of management accounting, was released about two weeks ago. A Federal High Court in Osogbo, Osun state, in 2018 sentenced Akindele to prison after he pleaded guilty to four counts filed against him by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission. Justice Maureen Onyetenu sentenced Akindele to 24 months’ imprisonment for asking a student Monica Osagie for a sexual benefit and another 24 months jail-term for soliciting sexual benefit from the victim to pass her. The judge also sentenced Akindele to 12 months for deleting parts of the WhatsApp conversation between him and Osagie to conceal evidence against him and sentenced him to another 12 months for falsification of age. She held that the jail terms would run concurrently implying that the convict would spend 24 months. In an audio which went viral online, Akindele was heard demanding five rounds of sex from Osagie to award her a pass mark in a course she failed. Efforts to get official comment from the Nigerian Prisons Service on Friday proved abortive but a reliable source at the NPS confirmed Akindele’s release. “He was released about two weeks ago having completed his jail term,” the source said. Akindele appealed against his conviction and the hearing is scheduled at the court of appeal of Akure, Ondo State, on May 19. Copyright PUNCH.
