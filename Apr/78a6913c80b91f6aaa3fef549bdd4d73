Ebenezer Bajela Super Eagles and Leganes centre-back, Kenneth Omeruo, has admitted he misses football following the suspension of all sporting activities, which include football, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Omeruo, who had just secured a permanent move to Leganes last summer from Premier League side Chelsea after an impressive season with the club while on loan, hopes the pandemic, which has halted football matches in the Spanish top-flight, will soon come to an end. Spain is one of the most affected countries with total number of deaths in the country standing at 11,744, second only to Italy. In a way to curb the spread of the virus, the World Health Organisation has urged people to stay-at-home, much to the frustration of the Nigerian. The 22-year-old took to the social media to express his frustration at the current situation while urging people to respect the stay at home rule. “I miss the game; I hope this madness ends soon, but still then, stay at home please,” Omeruo wrote on his Twitter handle. Omeruo has been a mainstay for the Cucumber Growers despite an injury laden season, featuring in 19 league games and scoring a goal. Leganes are currently 19 in the table with 23 points from 27 games and will hope to continue their fight to avoid the drop from the Spanish top-flight if and when the season resumes. Copyright PUNCH.
