The All Progressives Congress has urged the Niger Delta Development Commission to ignore the unprovoked attacks on its COVID-19 intervention efforts by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party. The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, made the call in Abuja, on Tuesday. In a statement he signed, Yekini said, allegations of fraud levelled against the NDDC by the PDP were baseless. The PDP had in a statement alleged that the NDDC’s COVID -19 intervention efforts especially in the provision of   Personal Protective Equipment and other medical kits to states in the Niger Delta region were fraudulent.
