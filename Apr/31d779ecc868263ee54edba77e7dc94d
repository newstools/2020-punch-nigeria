Gibson Achonu, Owerri The Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, has said the Internally Generated Revenue of the state has increased from N600m to N1.2bn monthly. He said this during his statewide broadcast as part of events marking his first 100 days in office. According to him, the feat was achieved partly through the elimination of middlemen in the IGR chain. He said, “Our target is to automate the IGR process and ensure that all internal revenue generated are paid into a Single Treasury Account. “With the measures in place, leakages in internally revenue receipts would have been eradicated and the stage set for the government to net in a monthly IGR target of N5bn.” He further said his administration was working to capture revenues due to the state from oil companies, oil servicing companies and financial institutions operating in the state. In another development, Uzodinma said the state government had provided 150 security pick-up patrol vans for a combined team of the military, the police, Department of State Services and other security agencies under Operation Search and Flush Security outfit, to police the state on a 24-hour basis.
