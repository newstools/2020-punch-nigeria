Jesusegun Alagbe Some Nigerians have expressed outrage over the invitation of 18 Chinese medical experts to the country to assist in the fight against the coronavirus, a microbe which causes COVID-19. Observation by our correspondent showed that the Nigerians distrusted the Chinese government, hence they asked the Federal Government to be wary of bringing in the Chinese medical team, especially as they are coming from where the disease originated from. As the coronavirus pandemic spreads and countries struggle to respond, China has somewhat positioned itself as a global leader and benefactor in public health by donating coronavirus testing kits, ventilators, face masks and medics to African countries and others such as Italy, France, the Philippines, Spain, Iran and Iraq. Some of the countries have, however, complained that thousands of the Chinese equipment are below standard or defective, while some countries have also turned down the offer by China to send its medics to them. About a week after Nigeria received some medical equipment from Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, the Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, disclosed that 18 Chinese medics would soon arrive in the country to assist in the fight against COVID-19. The minister said this on Friday during a briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja, adding that he had been notified of medical supplies from China courtesy of a group of Chinese companies working in Nigeria.
