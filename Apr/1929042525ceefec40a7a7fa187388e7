Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Some gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen on Sunday invaded the Unguwan Magaji village, Kamaru Chawai Ward of the Kauru Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing four persons and razing 36 houses, the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union alleged on Monday. But the spokesman for the Kaduna State Police Command, ASP Mohammed Jalige, said he had yet to confirm the incident. But a statement by the National Public Relations Officer of SOKAPU, Mr Luka Binniyat,  said brave youths of the village put strong resistance to the invaders. “One of the attackers was found dead and his phone retrieved and has revealed useful information which have been passed to the police,” the statement said. The union said the gunmen  invaded the village  at about 6.45pm on Sunday through the hills that served as the boundary of Kaduna State and Ganawuri, Plateau State. They listed those killed during the attack to include Mrs Hanatu Joseph(58), Mrs Sarah Sunday (40),  Mrs Dije Sajay (55) and Mr Sunday David (47). The statement read, “The attackers targeted food stores and  bags of grains, making sure they burnt as much as they could. This is to ostensibly cause starvation, especially under this lockdown from the coronavirus. “Meanwhile, early this month, Ibrahim Atiga,42, a native of Unguwan Magaji, was killed by herdsmen on his way to the farm. “The phone number of the dead Fulani herdsman in the Unguwan Magaji attack is 090 3708 4640. It added, “We are hereby calling on the police to take this rare lead and carry out a scrupulous forensic investigation and make their findings public. We shall keep a keen eye on this and we call on the general public to also show interest.” Copyright PUNCH.
