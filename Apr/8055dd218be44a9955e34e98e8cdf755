Sola Shittu, Benin The Edo State Government has closed Omosefe Orphanage Home in Benin City over poor facilities and lack of professional care-givers to attend to children in the facility. The Commissioner for Social Development and Gender Issues, Mrs. Maria Edeko, ordered the facility closure during an unscheduled inspection of the orphanage in company with the ministry’s permanent secretary and other officials. She said the orphanage was shut down because it was untidy and unfit for human habitation, as the children in the facility were left at the mercy of non-professionals. She noted that the action was to serve as a deterrent to other orphanages denying orphans in their custody good care. Edeko said, “We observed the hazardous condition of the home. It was untidy and unfit for human habitation. The children were left at the mercy of a young girl and the security guard. This predisposes the children to sexual assault and other forms of violence.” The commissioner insisted that no child in the state would be exposed to such danger under the Governor Godwin Obaseki-administration, as children are the state’s greatest asset. Edeko said though the children were orphans, they were entitled to full rights as humans, appealing to owners of orphanages to provide proper homes with schools, dormitory, refectory, sports and medical facilities, among others Copyright PUNCH.
