’Tosin Oluwalowo English Premier League side Chelsea have contacted Lille over the possible signing of Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, according to reports. The London-based side are reportedly eyeing a double swoop for Osimhen and teammate Gabriel Magalhaes, according to French outlet le10sport.com. “According to our sources, the Blues very recently contacted the northern leaders to discuss several subjects. “Since the transfer of Eden Hazard , the relationship between the two clubs has been very good. And even if Lille change, the contact is always excellent. The first target is Victor Osimhen,” le10sport.com was quoted as saying. “If the rumour indicates that the Blues are ‘cooled’ by the coronavirus crisis, the reality is completely the opposite. Chelsea wants to invest this summer and is clearly able to complete a case like that of Osimhen, for whom the LOSC could clearly explode the record for the biggest sale of the club,” the report added. Osimhen has been in terrific form since joining Lille from Belgian side Sporting Charleroi in the summer, netting 18 goals in 38 appearances. Copyright PUNCH.
