Raphael Ede, Enugu Rainstorm has wreaked havoc on the Amagunze community in the Kanu East Local Government Area of Enugu State, destroying schools, residential buildings and other property worth millions of naira. PUNCH Metro gathered that the incident, which occurred on Tuesday as the state witnessed a torrential rainfall, threw the community into confusion as many of the affected residents had nowhere to lay their heads and could not go anywhere else, as the state was in a lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic. A community leader, Francis Nnamani, told our correspondent on Thursday that the rainstorm blew off the roof of the Community Secondary School. The science laboratory of the school was on January 20, 2020, razed by fire. Nnamani said residential houses and other property were also destroyed by the rainstorm. He said, “As a community leader, I visited the school this morning in company with the Principal, Mr Ignatius Obusi, to see the level of damage. The high level of the destruction recorded in the school is indeed disheartening and worrisome. “The principal has already taken inventory of what was destroyed by the rainstorm for onward submission to the Post Primary Management Board and other relevant bodies for necessary action.” Copyright PUNCH.
