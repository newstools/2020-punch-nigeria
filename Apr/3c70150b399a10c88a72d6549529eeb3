Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers, Lagos State branch, has said it is willing to offer consultancy services to the Lagos State Government in the management of isolation centres in the state. The Chairman of the branch, Mr Adedotun Bamigbola, made this known during a courtesy visit to the Lagos State Governor,  Babajide Sanwo-Olu, with the presentation of Personal Protective Equipment to the state’s medical team. Bamigbola, who commended the governor for the leadership role he had played so far in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, said the institution had been doing a lot to sensitise its members as well as the general public by putting out short video clips and flyers to further help spread the message about COVID-19 and its impact on human lives. “The institution is also ready to support the Lagos State Government composition particularly in terms of facilities management  consultancy services to help manage the isolation centres used for treating patients of COVID-19,” he said. The branch presented 60 pieces of protective gowns and 100 pieces of reusable face shields to the first lady, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, who represented the governor. Sanwo-Olu said the state would not relax until a complete end had been put to the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Copyright PUNCH.
