The Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Tuesday inaugurated the Osun Joint Task force as part of efforts to strengthen security in the state. Oyetola said the task force was inaugurated to fight against kidnapping, cultism, illegal mining and other related crimes in the state. “It is also intended to consolidate our achievements and retain the status of  Osun as the safest State in Nigeria. The Joint Task Force is a collaboration of the Army, the Police, the Air Force, the Department of State Service, the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps and the Immigration Service, and it shall provide operational support for Amotekun to fight cultism, kidnapping, illegal mining and other related crimes. “All these efforts are aimed at reducing the incursion of criminals into the state. “There is no hiding place for men of the underworld in the State of Osun. Today’s flag-off is, therefore, a warning to them to either leave the State of Osun or face the music”, Oyetola said. The governor urged officials of the task force to serve with the fear of God and sense of patriotism, integrity, commitment and diligence. “Let me admonish our people to cooperate with the Joint Task Force as they are at work in our collective interest,” he added.
