Gibson Achonu, Owerri The Imo State Command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency has arrested one Chidi Gogoh with over 247.03 kilograms of cannabis sativa, otherwise known as Indian hemp. The 48-year-old suspect was arrested around 1.30am on Sunday at his family residence in Ezinihitte Mbaise following a tip-off. Parading the suspect on Monday, the Assistant State Commander, Operations and Intelligence, NDLEA, Mr Raji Kayode, stated, “We monitored the suspect for several months before we struck on Sunday. As an intelligent-based organisation, we took our time to monitor him. “The suspect has been a notorious supplier of the substance to most retail outlets. Believe you me, his arrest and parade means cutting off the supply and in-take of the hard drug in the state.” Kayode also promised that investigation into the case would be thorough and that the agency had put in place measures for the safe custody of the seized drug. Gogoh told PUNCH Metro that when the operatives of the agency swooped on him, he mistook them for armed robbers. “When they came into my house, I thought that they were armed robbers. It was when I saw their crested vest that I was assured that they were operatives of the agency,” Gogoh stated. Copyright PUNCH.
