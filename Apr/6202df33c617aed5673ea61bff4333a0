Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja The Bureau of Public Enterprises says it has distributed food items to 1,200 households in the Federal Capital Territory to mitigate the hardship occasioned by the lockdown. A statement by the BPE said officials of the bureau, led by the Director General, Alex Okoh, distributed food items to some households in the Kuje area of the FCT on Tuesday. Speaking at the palace of the Esu Dakachi Gbaupe, Chief Danjuma Gajere, Okoh noted that the crisis caused by the coronavirus disease should be a cause for concern for everyone. He also prayed to God for a quick eradication of the pandemic. Okoh explained that the BPE decided to reach out to the less- privileged in the FCT in order to cushion the hardship brought about by the lockdown. He noted that although the 300 bags of assorted foodstuffs may not reach all the targeted beneficiaries, the gesture was the bureauâ€™s modest way of identifying with the less- privileged.
