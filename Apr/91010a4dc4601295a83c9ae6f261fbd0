Tunde Ajaja and  Afeez Hanafi There was apprehension at the OPIC end of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway in Isheri on Wednesday when a diesel-laden tanker fell by the side of the road. Shortly after the incident, many young persons invaded the scene and started scooping fuel from the busted tanker. The incident, which happened around 12.43pm, was witnessed by our correspondents, some policemen, motorists and passersby. There were fears that the tanker could explode due to the actions of the youth. The crash happened when the driver of the unregistered tanker suddenly veered right from the light traffic that had built up at the police checkpoint close to the Long Bridge. The driver was seen on top speed and struggling to manoeuvre through the deep potholes by the side of the road, which caused the tank to severe from the engine. The truck only had 242 written on it in blue ink. The driver fled the scene immediately after the crash. People around the location immediately stormed the scene with buckets and jerry cans to scoop diesel, while the policemen enforcing the lockdown tried to chase them away. The Ogun State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Clement Oladele, said officials of the corps and firefighters were deployed in the scene to avert a fire outbreak. “We invited the fire service to ensure that the situation is brought under control. There is no fire outbreak. We have to trans-load the fuel and we are doing final recovery to make sure that normalcy returns,” Oladele stated. Copyright PUNCH.
