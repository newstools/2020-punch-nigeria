Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The House of Representatives has said it will probe the alleged attempted jailbreak that occurred at the Kaduna Correctional Centre, on Tuesday, which reportedly led to the death of four inmates. The Chairman, House Committee on Reformatory Institutions, Anayo Edwin, in a statement on Monday, said an inquest into the circumstances leading to the death of the inmates became necessary following conflicting reports on the incident. Edwin noted that the House was bothered by the conflicting reports on the deaths resulting from the jailbreak or resulting from displeasure by the armed squad of the service over the inmates’ fear of the coronavirus pandemic. The statement read, “All these facts therefore require investigations for the committee to take an informed position. Consequently, the committee chairman reiterated his earlier call for the Nigerian Correctional Service to take urgent steps to protect inmates and workers of the service nationwide from the COVID 19, which is currently ravaging the world. “Edwin noted that the 9th House, in line with its legislative agenda, is committed to the well-being of inmates at the various correctional centres across the country, who, by law, retains their right to life and dignity of persons at all times, even in the face of death sentence. “He stated that the House would stop at nothing to ensure that the inmates were treated with dignity while in confinement. Consequently, the committee chairman charged the NCS authorities to place high premium on the safety of the inmates as the House frowns seriously on the needless death of any inmate.” Copyright PUNCH.
