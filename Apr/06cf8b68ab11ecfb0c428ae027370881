Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt A Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt on Tuesday sentenced a businessman, Sampson Onyekachi, to two years imprisonment for issuing a N5.1m dud cheque. Justice M. O. Opara of the State High Court convicted Onyekachi on a one count bordering on issuance of a dud cheque after finding the defendant guilty of the offence. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission had arrested, investigated and arraigned the defendant after the matter was reported to it at its zonal office in Port Harcourt. Onyekachi was said to have issued the cheque in May 2016 through his firm, Esteemed Technical Nigeria Limited, to Elass Venture Nigeria Enterprise as part payment of the sum of N9,610,000, for the supply of equipment to Daewoo Company in the Brass Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. It was learnt that the cheque was returned unpaid within three months of issue due to insufficient funds standing to the credit of the drawer. The one count against the convict read, “That you, Mr Sampson Onyekachi, trading on the name and style Esteemed Technical Nigeria Ltd, sometime in May 2016 at Port Harcourt in the Port Harcourt Judicial Division of the High Court of Rivers State, did fraudulently issue a Sterling Bank Plc cheque with No. 144 50110, dated 13th day of May 2016 in the sum of five million, one hundred thousand Naira (N5,100,000) in your business name, Esteemed Technical Nigeria Ltd, holder of account No. 0014945882 to Elas Ventures Nigeria Enterprise.” Copyright PUNCH.
