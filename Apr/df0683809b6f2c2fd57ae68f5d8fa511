Ebenezer Bajela Former Super Eagles striker, Yakubu Aiyegbeni, has ruled out coaching, and would prefer to venture into other fields. Speaking with Goal, the former Portsmouth, Middlesbrough and Leicester City striker says he enjoys his role as a FIFA ambassador, adding that he prefers it to coaching. “I don’t want to be a coach,” Yakubu said. “I went to the U-20 (Flying Eagles) camp in Munich before they went to Poland. There, I stayed for over a week and passed my message to the young footballers. “I even coached the strikers a little bit and I am always ready to help out when I’m needed but coaching is not for me. “I enjoy what I’m doing now than coaching, but, I can come in whenever I’m needed to speak to the boys and pass my knowledge to the upcoming players. “I was in the national team for 10 years and I had a great time there, good or bad. “For me, to be invited to speak with the U-15s, U-17s and U-20s will be nice and I will be willing to help in the future. But as a coach, that’s not for me.” He also spoke on his experience as a FIFA ambassador and taking football to distressed countries. “I’ve been travelling around with FIFA,” he added. “We were once in Malawi and the last time, I went to Tsonga, I’ve been with them (FIFA) for almost a year now. “I enjoy working with FIFA and being one of their ambassadors is great. You meet people; you try to pass a message to the upcoming players. “It’s not really about football alone because you meet with people from other sports, encouraging them to follow their dreams. “Having a chance talking to these boys from the streets, speaking to them to follow their passion is like a dream come true for me.” Copyright PUNCH.
