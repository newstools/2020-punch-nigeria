Enyioha Opara, Minna The police in Niger State have arrested a 25-year-old man at the Kontogora Park by the Mobil roundabout, Minna, for unlawful possession of firearms. The suspect, Danjuma Toko, of Zuru, Kebbi State, was apprehended for unlawful possession of six locally-made revolver shotguns. It was gathered that the suspect allegedly received the firearms from one Paul Ogoja in Cross River State to deliver to his cousins, Kabiru Kando and Daudu Kando, in Zuru, Kebbi State. Toko reportedly concealed the weapons in a bag of rice. The suspect told our correspondent that he was only contracted to deliver the firearms to his cousins. “I am not interested in what they want to do with the firearms, but they were given to me by one Paul Ogoja to give to Kabiru and Daudu. I have nothing to do with the firearms personally,” he stated. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Wasiu Abiodun, said Toko would be arraigned for illegal possession of firearms after investigation. Copyright PUNCH.
