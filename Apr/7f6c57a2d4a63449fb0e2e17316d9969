Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board said on Wednesday that it had donated three ventilators to hospitals in the Federal Capital Territory. The board noted that the action was its way of ensuring that “government strategies and preemptive measures yielded fruitful dividends.” While JAMB gave two ventilators to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, it gave the third to the Bwari General Hospital, Bwari, Abuja, which is the host community of the board. In a statement, JAMB Head of Information, Dr Fabian Benjamin, said, “The donation of these ventilators which cost several millions of naira is to strategically place these hospitals in good stead to give necessary treatment to the coronavirus patients whether in Bwari or any other part of Abuja. “However, this gesture is in addition to the several other interventions aimed at aiding the fight against the virus. The board will continue to support the fight against the pandemic within its limited means and by so doing, protect our teeming candidates who are the hopes of tomorrow.” Copyright PUNCH.
