The Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, on Tuesday, described the death of its erstwhile Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr Chris Olakpe, as a big loss to it. Olakpe died in the early hours of Monday at the age of 66. Reacting to Olakpe’s demise, the General Manager, LASTMA, Mr Olajide Oduyoye, said the agency was saddened by the development. Oduyoye stated, “When someone is a nice and caring person, and you lose such a person in this world that we are in, you feel sad in you. “I didn’t meet him there at work, but I met him about three weeks ago and I know he was a kind-hearted man. From all the stories about him, while he was in LASTMA as the CEO, he was a very good man. “Unfortunately, for whatever reason, it is always the good ones that die first, while the bad ones are left behind. We feel sad that this has happened. “Really, as LASTMA, it is a very big loss to us, because once you are in LASTMA, you are part of the family.” The general manager, who noted that the demise of the former LASTMA CEO was painful to the agency, said Olakpe had done his bit for humanity. He added, “It is the Lord, who brings people to the world and it is Him, who decides when it is time to go. “Olakpe has done his own bit, he has run his own race and raised beautiful children, who are doing very well and that is the best you can ask for.” The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Olakpe was appointed as the CEO of LASTMA by former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode in 2015. He was a retired Assistant Inspector-General of Police before he assumed office as the CEO of LASTMA. He was born on June 5, 1954, and enlisted in the Nigeria Police Force as a Cadet Assistant Superintendent in July 1980.
