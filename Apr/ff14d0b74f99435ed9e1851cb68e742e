Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun,  has asked critics of his decision to allow Dangote truck drivers to operate during the statewide lockdown to strive to succeed like the Chairman of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, to enjoy such privileges. Abiodun said this at a press briefing held in his hometown at Ikenne, on Monday. There had been mixed feelings over the action of the state government which issued an exception letter to Dangote to operate in the state during the lockdown. Reacting to the criticisms, Abiodun said, “I really wonder what the people are crying about. Dangote is not the only one that we gave approval to conduct their businesses because we have identified them as critical stakeholders in the state. “We’ve done the same for Lafarge and a few others as well. First of all, Dangote is the person leading the private sector and the CBN initiative to support the entire country during this exercise and that group today has raised about N20bn. “So, when people start saying things like this, I don’t know how many Dangotes are there in this country or on this continent. As far as I know, Dangote is the African richest man today.” Copyright PUNCH.
