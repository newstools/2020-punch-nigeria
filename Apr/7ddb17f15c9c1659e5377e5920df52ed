The government imposed the five-day dusk-to-dawn curfew about 24 hours after it reiterated that its COVID-19 order against any form of social gathering in the state was still in force. The governor had in a statement on Saturday by his acting Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, insisted that the directive banning gatherings at worship centres had not been lifted. Diri said, “The total lockdown on any form of gathering, including worship centres, is in force. No kind of gathering, even in churches, is permitted after the Easter celebrations. The order is that worship services, no matter the number of persons, are prohibited for now. People should meet in their homes and not in worship centres.”
