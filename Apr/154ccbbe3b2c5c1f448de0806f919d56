Peter Dada, Akure There are indications that all is not well with the Unity Forum of the All Progressives Congress in Ondo State. Members of the group have accused some of their colleagues of causing disunity within its ranks. This was contained in a statement issued by members of a section of the group under the auspices of the Professionals in Ondo Unity Forum, on Wednesday. They alleged that some members were already planning to defect to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party. In the statement signed by the Secretary of the group, Ralph Adetimehin, they said, “We would like to inform the public that from our findings, those behind this mischief and lies belong to two classes. “The first class are those non-members of the forum who by sympathy have preferred aspirants they believe will emerge; they have suddenly developed fear that their preferred governorship aspirants are not likely to emerge. “The other class are the few individuals who are already getting set to defect to the PDP and are afraid of the rising profile of the Ondo APC Unity Forum. “They are thereby ready to sponsor some willing allies in the first group, who have been conquered by hunger and fear, to destabilise the unity forum before they take their leave to the PDP where their hearts now belong.” Copyright PUNCH.
