Paulo Dybala has reportedly tested positive for coronavirus for the fourth time in six weeks. The Argentinian ace confirmed last month he had contracted COVID-19 shortly after Serie A action had been suspended due to the global pandemic. He was one of three Juventus stars to test positive for the illness with Daniele Rugani and Blaise Matuidi. But, according to Spanish TV programme El Chiringuito, Dybala is struggling to shake off the disease. He was said to have delivered a total of four positive tests in the last six weeks despite no longer having many of the symptoms. That places his status over a return to action in severe doubt with Serie A players allowed to return to training from Monday, May 4.
