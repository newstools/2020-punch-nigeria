Anna Okon The coronavirus pandemic has reportedly shortened dollar supply in the economy and subsequently prevented importers, exporters and terminal operators  from meeting  their obligations. Our correspondent gathered that the continuous fall in oil prices had affected the volume of dollars coming into the economy since March and the situation had been transferred to the Exporters and Importers Foreign Exchange window. The Central Bank of Nigeria had earlier suspended supply of forex to bureau de change operators and pegged the dollar at N380/$. As of the time of writing this report however, the US dollar is trading for N425/$. The shortage in dollar supply has also limited the ability of shipping firms and terminal operators to meet their dollar payment obligation to the Nigerian Ports Authority and the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency. The Nigerian Shippers’ Council in a statement lamented that international trade was seriously hampered by the inability of shippers to access forex for import and export purposes. The Executive Secretary, NSC, Hassan Bello, subsequently urged the Central Bank of Nigeria to direct banks to provide forex to shipping companies to enable them fulfill their obligations to government agencies.
