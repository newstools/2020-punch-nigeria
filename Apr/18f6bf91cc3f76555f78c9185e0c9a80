Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, said on Tuesday that the state government would not wait for the Federal Government support in the fight towards checking the spread of COVID-19 in the state. Wike said the government was committed to providing palliatives for the people of the state. Speaking after inaugurating a 33-man committee to purchase foodstuffs from farmers and fishermen for distribution to the state residents on Tuesday at the Government House, Port Harcourt, Wike said, “We are not waiting for the Federal Government to assist us. We are making the right sacrifices to promote the welfare of our people.” Wike asked members of the committee to work for the people by deploying the allocated funds for the good of the people. He added, “It is the duty of this committee to ensure that this policy succeeds. We must not fold our arms at this time. “Our goal is to ensure that no agricultural product like yam, garri, plantain, palm oil and fish leaves our state during this period. “While the farmers and fishermen will make their profits, the underprivileged will have enough food supply for their families.” Wike also announced the one-month suspension of the council chairman of Abua/Odual LGA for failing to show commitment towards the fight against coronavirus. ”Copyright PUNCH.
