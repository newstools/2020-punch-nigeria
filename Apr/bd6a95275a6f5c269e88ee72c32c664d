Matthew Ochei, Asaba There was pandemonium on Thursday in Issele-Azagba, Aniocha North Local Government Area, Delta State, following the killing of a poultry farm manager and the gateman in the community by suspected Fulani herdsmen. PUNCH Metro gathered that the attack on the poultry located behind the Issele-Azagba Mixed Secondary School was around 10pm on Wednesday, during which the yet-to-be identified farm manager and gateman were killed. A source said the third person, who was with the farm manager, hid in the ceiling when the armed men were shooting, adding that he came out after the hoodlums had left and raised the alarm. The source said, “The hoodlums had climbed the fence of the farm to gain entrance into the compound and knocked at the elderly security man’s door. On recognising the voice of one of the Fulani herdsmen who usually came for water, the gateman queried why he chose to visit at that late hour. “Their argument eventually woke the poultry manager, who was shot through the window of his room while the watchman was shot at a close range.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the incident. She said, “ For now the situation is calm as our men are working on information and as soon as there is any further development, I assure you, we will make it public.” Copyright PUNCH.
