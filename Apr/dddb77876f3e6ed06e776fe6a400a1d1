Matthew Ochei, Asaba The Nigerian Medical Association, Delta State chapter has warned its members and other health workers not to go near any COVID-19 patients without appropriate Personal Protective Equipment. The NMA said doctors and healthcare workers need to be adequately protected to save lives. Doctors had earlier raised an alarm over the shortage of PPE and face marks at DELSUTH and other isolation centres in the state, The PUNCH reports. The State Chairman of NMA, Dr Ekeneam Omo, while briefing journalists in Asaba, stated that doctors and healthcare workers in the state had been mandated not to go near any COVID-19 patient without their protective kits, especially the Hazmat suit. He said, “Doctors in the state have been mandated by the association not to go near any COVID-19 patient without the appropriate PPE. “State government should make available adequate PPE to all health workers in the state. We request that full complement of PPE including HAZMAT suit, a minimum of N95 face masks, gloves, face shield/goggle and aprons at all time.” He lamented that over 25 doctors were currently in the isolation centre at UBTH having been infected, stressing that the association would not close its eyes and allow its members to die as a result of inadequate protection.
