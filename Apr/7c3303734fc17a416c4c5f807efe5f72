Johnny Edward No fewer than 30 footballers have been charged to court for involving in a football match in defiance of the lockdown order imposed on the state to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje had on April 14 ordered a total lockdown of the state for seven days, starting from April 16, as part of urgent measures to stem the spread of the pandemic. But on Monday, the players took part in a football match in Dala Local Government Area of the state, defying the social distancing and lockdown order. Deputy Superintendent of Police in Kano Abdullahi Haruna told The PUNCH that the offenders would face the full wrath of the law. “They have been charged to court for violating the orders of the land and they will be arraigned in the coming days,” Haruna told The PUNCH. “Already, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Habu Sani, has ordered that the matter be transferred to the State Criminal Intelligence Department for investigation and the suspects will be arraigned soon.” [READ ALSO] COVID-19: How judiciary bungled opportunity to avert court shutdown Haruna urged the youths in the state to respect the lockdown order, practice social distancing and avoid playing football to prevent the spread of COVID-19, adding that the command had intensified patrol in the metropolis and other parts of the state to enforce compliance with the lockdown order. “Anyone found on the streets playing football will be arrested and made to face the wrath of the law,” he added.
