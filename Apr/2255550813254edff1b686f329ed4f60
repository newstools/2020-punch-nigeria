Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta Worshippers at the Christ Apostolic Church (Oke-Iyanu) on Hospital Road, Ogijo, in the Sagamu Local Government Area of Ogun State on Sunday,  scampered for safety as policemen arrested their pastor, Jonathan Olowonisile, and four others during service. The police were said to have arrested the associate pastor and three other members. The action of the policemen was part of the moves to ensure compliance with the sit-at-home order by the government. It was gathered that worshippers had congregated in the church to observe the Easter Sunday service when policemen attached to the Ogijo division invaded the church and arrested the pastor while other members took to their heels. It was further gathered that the news of the arrest of the pastor and others forced other recalcitrant churches in the area to abruptly shut their doors. One of the members of the church, who spoke on condition of anonymity said,  “What happened today is an indication that we have been under surveillance.
