Kayode Oyero Akwa Ibom State Governor, Emmanuel Udom, says his government makes use of technology to monitor human infiltration through the state borders. The PUNCH reports that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had in his address on April 27, ordered a ban on non-essential inter-state passenger travel until further notice as part of measures to curtail the spread of coronavirus. However, prior to the issuance of the President’s directive, the Nigeria Governors’ Forum had also agreed to restrict interstate movement in order to halt the community transmission of the virus with cases now over 4,000 in the country. In the past week, state governors have been seen with patrol teams supervising compliance at their borders to restrain further import of persons infected with the disease. Some defaulters have since been arrested in different parts of the country. Commenting via Twitter on Saturday, Udom said Akwa Ibom State deployed “3G cameras” at her borders in the place of the physical surveillance. “There are 3G cameras at our borders. We monitor every movement at our situation rooms. It is there at Itu, Ikot Abasi and other busy borders. We don’t take pleasure in noise making. The fact that you don’t see me jump on trailers does not mean we are not doing our best,” he tweeted. According to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, the state has so far reported 17 COVID-19 infections including 10 recoveries and two deaths.
