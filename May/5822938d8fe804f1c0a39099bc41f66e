Umar Muhammed, Lafia The Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has said his administration will complete the ex-Governor Abdullahi Adamuâ€™s abandoned N5.4bn Farin-Ruwa Independent Power Plant in the state. Adamu, who was the first civilian governor of the state, now Senator representing Nasarawa West at the National Assembly, awarded the project in 2004. Sule spoke on Wednesday after inspecting the 15.5km Sisin Baki-Kwarra road, as part of activities marking his one year in office.
