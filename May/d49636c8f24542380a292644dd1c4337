Kelvin Ekerete French side Lille have reduced the selling price of striker Victor Osimhen to €55m as they continue to seek a potential high-profile buyer for the in-demand star. Lille had the intention of selling the Nigerian for almost the price they sold Ivorian forward, Nicholas Pepe, who moved to Arsenal for €79m this season. According to Italian media, Sport Mediaset, a contractual agreement has already been agreed between Italian side Napoli and Osimhen, with discussions set to resume between the two clubs. The report says Lille have set their price for the 21-year-old at €55m. The current reality of the market due to the outbreak of the coronavirus has forced Lille into reducing the price as clubs are unwilling to match the €70m originally stated for the player. Lille Sporting Director, Luis Campos, according to reports, has identified Guadalajara striker, José Macias, as a replacement for the Nigerian should he decide to depart in the summer. According to Corriere dello Sport, Osimhen would be one of Napoli’s favourite options for this summer transfer window. The Napolitans are determined to strengthen Gennaro Gattuso’s workforce for next season and the LOSC striker would be a perfect fit for the club. Copyright PUNCH.
