MultiChoice Nigeria has dismissed reports that it is set to increase subscription rates for its DStv and GOtv packages from June 1. The company explained that the price adjustments it recently announced, which will take effect from June 1, were to reflect the increase in the rate of the Value Added Tax by 2.5 per cent, as announced by the Federal Government from five per cent to 7.5 per cent. In a statement issued in Lagos, MultiChoice said it did not start implementing the new VAT rate on February 1 in order to provide relief for its customers. “We acknowledge that Nigerians are living under increased economic pressure and want to make every naira they spend count. We remain committed to providing our customers with value for their money, while giving them access to the best available content. DStv and GOtv products and services will be amended to include 7.5 per cent VAT,” the statement read.
