Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The Federal Capital Territory Ministerial Enforcement Task team on COVID-19 on Tuesday arrested 29 commercial motorcycle riders, who were travelling in a truck from Lafia in Nasarawa State to Lagos. The truck, with registration number LFA 837 ZX, was stopped at the AYA Bridge in the Asokoro District of the FCT. The driver, Samaila Samiya, said on getting to Lafia, he decided to pick the passengers after they pleaded to pay him N2,000 each. One of the passengers, Musa Simon, claimed they were commercial motorcycle riders who had left Lagos in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown. “We are returning to resume work following threats by motorcycle owners that they would sell off the motorcycles if we fail to resume work,” he said.

She also ordered that all the occupants of the truck be sent back to their point of departure. Copyright PUNCH.
