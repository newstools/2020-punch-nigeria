Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, on Tuesday paid glowing tributes to the Afenifere leader, Chief Reuben Fasoranti, saying the elder statesman’s virtues shaped his life. Fayemi, in a congratulatory letter to Chief Fasoranti on his 94th birthday, said the life of the Afenifere leader was an inspiration to him and other students of Christ’s School, Ado Ekiti, where the elder statesman served as a principal. According to a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, the governor, in the letter, described Pa Fasoranti as “not just a dedicated teacher, a seasoned school administrator but a moral compass” to the younger generation and a man of “unimpeachable moral conviction.” Fayemi said, “Baba, your life has been an inspiration to many of us who had the rare privilege of passing through our pupillage under your guidance. “Yours is an epitome of hard work, simplicity, contentment, honesty and strong character. “I recall with fond memory your lasting impressions on me as our school principal at Christ School, Ado-Ekiti.” He added, “One cannot but be proud of your record of impeccable service to the Old Ondo State as the Commissioner of Finance to the administration of Chief Adekunle Ajasin during which you were reputed for your probity, frugality and judicious use of public fund, which partly accounted for the historic successes of the administration. “It is to be noted that, in and out of government and politics, one thing has continued to define your character; and that is, unimpeachable moral conviction.” .Copyright PUNCH.
