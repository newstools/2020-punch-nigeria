Anna Okon Electricity workers under the aegis of Senior Staff Association of Electricity and Allied Companies have threatened to embark on industrial action over what they described as the unlawful sacking of the union’s President, Chris Okonkwo. The union is also alleging that the Transmission Company of Nigeria has been engaging in anti-labour practices. The union in a letter addressed to the Managing Director, TCN, Usman Mohammed, demanded that the sack letter be withdrawn immediately. The letter was signed by General Secretary of the Association, Umar Dubagari. It read in part, “We demand that the letter under reference be withdrawn immediately. In the event that you are unyielding to this demand, we shall mobilise all legal and industrial machineries at our disposal to resume our pending industrial action against you and this shall be without further notice.” Mohammed had in a letter dated 24/04/2020, terminated the appointment of Okonkwo, who was the general manager, special duties and President General, SSAEAC, from the services of TCN, saying that his contract had lapsed since June 11, 2018. But the union said the purported retirement was fraudulent as the SSAEAC president was a career officer and not a political appointee as the TCN MD. Copyright PUNCH.
