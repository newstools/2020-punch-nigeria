Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo National Vice-Chairman, South-West of the Peoples Democratic Party, Eddy Olafeso, has appointed the deputy chairman of the Osun State chapter of the party, Sunday Atidade, as acting state chairman of the party. This was contained in a letter signed by Olafeso, a copy of which was obtained by The PUNCH, in Osogbo on Thursday. In the letter, the National Vice Chairman directed Atidade, to act until such a time issues mentioned in a letter written to the state PDP chairman, Soji Adagunodo, were resolved. The National Secretary of the PDP, Senator Umaru Tsauri, had in a letter to Adegunodo, asked him to step aside pending the outcome of investigations by the party’s National Disciplinary Committee of allegations levelled against him. Adagunodo had rejected his suspension and called on members of the party to remain calm. However, Olafeso, in his letter to Atidade said, “In compliance with the directive of the National Working Committee of the Party, you are hereby directed to begin to act as Chairman of the Party in Osun State, pending the resolution of the issues contained in the letter addressed to Hon. Adagunodo Olasoji dated 30 April, 2020.” HURIWA faults composition of Police Trust Fund board Copyright PUNCH.
