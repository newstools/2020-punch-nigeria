Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Ekiti State Commissioner for Health, Dr Mojisola Yaya-Kolade, said on Saturday that the three new COVID-19 cases in the state were primary contacts of a late patient. Yaya-Kolade said the three persons were already undergoing 14 days isolation before the result of their samples were returned positive from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. The commissioner said in a statement that the new positive cases are all females with ages ranging from 26-50 years, who have been in self-isolation for 14 days now. She said, “Ekiti State Government can confirm that three of the samples sent to the NCDC accredited laboratory for testing have returned positive for COVID-19. “The samples were from three of the primary contacts of our third case, the late 29-year-old mother, who died of complications from childbirth on April 22, 2020.” The third case, a pregnant health worker, who came into the state from Lagos State despite the lockdown, tested positive for COVID-19 before her death during labour. Yaya-Kolade said the three new cases bring the total confirmed infections in Ekiti State to 11,  of which eight are active, two discharged, and one dead.
