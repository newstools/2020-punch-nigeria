Olaide Oyelude, Katsina The Emir of Daura, Dr Farouq Umar, on Thursday evening, returned to Daura after spending almost a month outside the town battling an undisclosed illness. The monarch was rushed from Daura to the Federal Medical Centre, Katsina on May 4 for an undisclosed illness. He was discharged from the medical centre last Thursday after recovering from the illness. The monarch, however, spent another week in Katsina, resting. The Emir’s spokesman, Usman Ibrahim, confirmed the return of the emir to Daura without giving details. Ibrahim said, “Yes, the royal father returned to Daura yesterday (Thursday) evening. We thank Almighty Allah for that.” The Emir, in an interview shortly after his discharge from the medical centre, implored people to support the current efforts by both Federal and the Katsina State governments in curbing the spread of COVID-19. He said, “I want to draw the attention of the people world over that the current pandemic is not a joke, hence people should fear God and return to God. “If the world is not settled, people should not expect anything good even if you are physically healthy.”
