Kelvin Ekerete Odion Ighalo’s agent Ladi Salami says the striker is very close to a salary agreement with Manchester United. Reports say Ighalo, whose United contract expires on Sunday, is set to return to his Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua, where a bumper four-year extension deal worth €84m is being proposed. According to Foot Mercato, Ighalo’s agent, Salami says discussions with United over a contract agreement for his player is going well. “Ighalo feels very good in Manchester with whom he is very close to a salary agreement. Negotiations with the Chinese are ongoing and are going well,” Salami said. Ighalo’s contract at Shanghai Shenhua is billed to expire in December 2021. The 30-year-old scored four goals in eight appearances for the Red Devils in all competitions before the outbreak of the coronavirus, which halted football activities. Despite Salami’s optimism about Ighalo’s future at United, Football Daily reports that the striker is not close to signing a deal at Old Trafford. “Odion Ighalo’s future is still up in the air as Manchester United are yet to make an offer for the Shanghai Shenhua striker, with his current loan deal set to expire on Sunday,” Football Daily stated.
