Sola Shittu, Benin Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Frank Okiye, says he recovered from coronavirus after 21 days in isolation without infecting anyone. Okiye, who spoke to journalists in Benin on Thursday, said all he did to prevent infecting his aides, family, and friends with the disease was strict adherence to government’s guidelines, especially those on social distancing, and compulsory use of face masks among others. The speaker, who is the index COVID-19 case in Edo, is amongst the 10 patients who have been discharged upon recovery and after testing negative twice for the virus. He urged residents of the state to complement the government’s efforts at checking the spread of the virus by making themselves available for the ongoing screening and testing in various centres across the state. “I came into the country from London through the international airport, and down to Benin airport with my aides and moved to my house; I was in self-isolation for about three weeks and none of my aides, family members, or friends was infected. “That was made possible because we insisted on adherence to all precautionary measures including social distancing, regular hygiene, and sanitising of the environment. “I ensured that if you had anything to do with me, you must wear face masks. I was an index case and didn’t infect anybody and I am certain that if we had 10 people like that, the thing wouldn’t have spread as we have it today,” he explained.
