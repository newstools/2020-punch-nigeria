A  leader  of  the All Progressives Congress in Ogun State, Mr Armstrong Akintunde, has lauded  Governor  Dapo Abiodun for his efforts  to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state. While commending the governor for allowing windows of relaxation during the lockdown, he said the strategy had eased the pain of about 80 per cent of residents who depended on daily earnings for their survival. Akintunde said, “Governor Abiodun has indeed made far-reaching decisions to flatten the curve of the virus with proactive measures such as the setting up of three isolation centres and COVID-19 treatment centres across the state, the establishment of molecular laboratory for quick access to coronavirus  testing  as well as the  distribution of food items to ease the lockdown pain.” He lamented  that successive governments had done little or nothing to empower the youths to enable them  to contribute to the development of the country. He urged the people of the state to keep on observing the World Health Organisation guidelines such as social distancing rule, washing of hands with soap and use of alcohol-based sanitizers as well as wearing of face masks to halt the spread of the deadly virus.
