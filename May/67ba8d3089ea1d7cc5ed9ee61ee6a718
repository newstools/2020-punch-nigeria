JESUSEGUN ALAGBE The Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Operations, Abdulmajid Ali, has alerted the public to his impersonation by some persons on social media. Ali, who stated that he did not own any other social media account apart from Facebook, said the impersonators had been creating fake accounts in his name and using them to dupe unwary Nigerians. A statement on Saturday by the Personal Assistant to the DIG, SP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, stated that some of the impersonators were selling fake courses to security operatives and unsuspecting Nigerians. The statement read, “The attention of the Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Operations, Abdulmajid Ali, has been drawn to the fraudulent acts of some unscrupulous elements who have been impersonating him on social media platforms and making direct phone calls to certain individuals and groups in order to dupe them and other innocent Nigerians. “The DIG Operations wishes to state in clear terms that he doesn’t operate any social media platforms aside from Facebook, which has even been dormant for a while; and has not in any way solicited help, either financial or in kind, from individuals or groups.’’ The statement quoted Ali as urging the public to beware of the impersonators and assist the police in their efforts to arrest them for investigation and prosecution. Ali also advised the general public to stay safe and abide by the guidelines against the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright PUNCH.
