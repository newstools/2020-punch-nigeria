Friday Olokor, Abuja The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has warned Nigerians to obey the curfew imposed by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), to sustain the battle against COVID – 19. He also pleaded that people should cooperate with the police and see the personnel of the law enforcement agency as partners in progress instead of continuously fighting and harassing them. While advising Nigerians to be at home by 8pm to avoid being in trouble, he noted that if people did what was expected of them, there would not be any need to be pushed over by the police. The IGP, represented by the Deputy Inspector-General of Police (Operations), Majid Ali, sounded the warning at the Force Headquarters in Abuja during the presentation of over 1,000 locally produced hardware protective face masks and other COVID – 19 protective kits by Otunba Segun Runsewe, Director-General of National Council for Arts and Culture. The items included locally made hardware protective cultural face-masks, regular face-masks made of local (adire) fabrics, hand sanitisers, liquid soap and information handbills on Covid-19 preventive measures, as well as exercise books.
