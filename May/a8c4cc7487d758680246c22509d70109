Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, has said the Federal Government will focus on stabilising the economy once the coronavirus pandemic is over. She said this on Thursday via the Twitter handle of the Ministry of Finance. In a series of tweets, Zainab said the medium-term macroeconomic stability would be focused on revenue-based fiscal consolidation that are essential to keep Nigeria’s debt sustainable. This, she stated, would create fiscal space for priority spending in key areas of the economy. She said, “The implementation of proper governance arrangements, including through the publication and independent audit of crisis-mitigating spending and procurement processes, is crucial to ensure emergency funds are used for their intended purposes. “Once the COVID-19 crisis passes, the focus should remain on medium-term macroeconomic stability, with revenue-based fiscal consolidation essential to keep Nigeria’s debt sustainable and create fiscal space for priority spending.” The finance minister said the implementation of reform priorities under the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan particularly on power and governance remained crucial to boosting growth over the medium term. Speaking on the $3.4bn emergency financing under the Rapid Financing Instrument, she said the amount would provide the much-needed liquidity support to respond to the country’s needs. She said additional assistance from development partners would be required to support the government’s efforts and close the large financing gap. Copyright PUNCH.
