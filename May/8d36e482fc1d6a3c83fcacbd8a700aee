Sodiq Oyeleke The Federal Road Safety Corps has rescued a pregnant woman who was struggling to drive herself to hospital amid labour pains. The FRSC spokesman, Mr Bisi Kazeem, in a statement on Sunday, said the incident occurred in Lagos. He said the woman later gave birth to a baby girl three hours after being rushed to a nearby hospital in Ajao Estate. Narrating how the incident happened, Kazeem said a patrol team belonging to the Airport Unit Command of the Corps sighted the pregnant woman about 2.34 p.m. on Saturday. He said, “As part of its statutory responsibility of saving lives through prompt rescue services on our roads, the Federal Road Safety Corps has again displayed a great deal of compassion and bravery in service to humanity by rescuing a pregnant woman from pains and agony of labour on the road. “The humanitarian gesture occurred on Saturday in Lagos when a patrol team belonging to RS 2.110 Airport Unit Command of the Corps about 2:34 PM sighted the pregnant woman struggling to drive amidst painful labour and rushed her to a nearby hospital in Ajao Estate where she was delivered of a baby girl barely three hours later.” The statement quoted Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, as applauding the patrol team “for such act of compassion and sacrifice”, which he described as “a positive representation of the true mission of the Corps”. He called on members of the public to always endeavour to notify the Federal Road Safety Corps any time they come across people in such distress situations and other emergencies for immediate action.
