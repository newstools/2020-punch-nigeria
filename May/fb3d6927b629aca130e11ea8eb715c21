Sola Shittu, Benin The police in Auchi, Edo State, on Tuesday, arrested a 30-year-old man, Endurance Eshegbai, popularly called Koma, for the murder of his cousin, Usman AbdulLateef, over the sale of a parcel of land for N2m. AbdulLateef, a native of Akpekpe, was declared missing last Wednesday after he left home with Eshegbai to an Automated Teller Machine point for a transaction, but never returned. His body was later found buried in a bush along the Auchi-Igarra Road. Eshegbai had earlier been invited by the police, being the last person the deceased interacted with on the day he went missing, but he was released after questioning. It was gathered that the Azomode Age Grade members were also involved in the search for AbdulLateef.

However, Eshegbai ran out of luck while attempting to make withdrawals from the deceased’s account on Tuesday as the bank immediately called the police and the family, and in the process, Eshegbai was arrested and he allegedly confessed to have killed his cousin over a N2m land deal. AbduLateef’s corpse was recovered by the police and members of the Auchi Vigilante Squad and buried on Tuesday according to Islamic rites. Copyright PUNCH.
