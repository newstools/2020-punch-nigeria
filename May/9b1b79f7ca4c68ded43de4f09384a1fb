Dayo Ojerinde The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajia Sadiya Umar Farouk, has said about 337,589 beneficiaries would gain from the modified school feeding programme in Lagos. Farouk, who was represented by the Director, National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and IDP’s, Mrs Margaret Ukegbu, said this at the inauguration of the school feeding programme in Lagos on Thursday. She said, “The special homegrown feeding intervention will impact 337,589 beneficiaries made up of parents, guardians and caregivers of primary schoolchildren in participating schools. “The identified and selected households will each receive 5kg bag of rice, 5kg bag of beans, vegetable and palm oil, salt, tomato paste and 15 pieces of eggs. “These rations have been revealed by a nutrition expert to ascertain the nutritional value and benefits to the children.” The Lagos Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folashade Adefisayo, said the modified school feeding programme was a continuation of the existing homegrown feeding programme of the state government. She reiterated the importance of food in the development of a child, noting that the modified feeding programme would go a long way in achieving that. “When a child is growing, it’s quite imperative that a child should have a good, quality, balanced diet to ensure that the brain grows appropriately because a hungry child cannot learn properly,” Adefisayo said.
