Nike Popoola The private sector-led Coalition Against COVID-19 has presented a 65-bed isolation/treatment centre to the Ogun State Government to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the state. In a statement, the coalition pledged to deploy available funds to save more lives of Nigerians who might contract coronavirus. CACOVID stated that the emergency health response initiative against COVID-19 jointly formed by the investors and players in the nation’s private sector was deployed to bridge the gap in the health infrastructure which had been seriously exposed to coronavirus in Nigeria. Speaking at the handover ceremony of the facility in Abeokuta on Wednesday, Access Bank Regional Manager, West and Team Lead, CACOVID, Ademola Bilesanmi, said, “COVID-19 is a global issue; it is a massive health challenge to the nations of the world and has affected lots of things. “So, as a responsible private organisation, we thought it necessary to support the Federal Government and state governments in the country for the fight against COVID-19. What we are doing is supporting their efforts and jointly fight this course.” Governor Dapo Abiodun acknowledged that the donation of beds, clinical equipment and isolation/ treatment centre would strengthen not only the fight against COVID-19 but also boost health infrastructure in the state even beyond the era of COVID-19.
