Dayo Ojerinde The Chairman, Board of Directors, City Pharmaceuticals and Allied Partners Limited, Mr Nnamdi Obi, has said the lack of basic health infrastructure is responsible for the inability of the health sector to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. While presenting medical products worth over N80m to the Lagos State Government recently, Obi urged Nigerians and corporate bodies to support the government in its efforts to halt the spread of COVID-19. He said, “Although the shortage of important materials to combat this pandemic is a major problem across the world, Nigeria’s case is worsened mainly due to the absence of basic health infrastructure.” Obi, who is also the President of the Association of Pharmaceutical Importers of Nigeria, said the firm decided to respond to the call to assist the Lagos State Government because Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had demonstrated exemplary leadership in the fight to contain the disease. “As part of our Corporate Social Responsibility, we are donating these drugs and clinical items, which include 100 units of complete sets of Personal Protective Equipment, 40 cartons of hand sanitisers, 23 cartons of examination gloves, 10 cartons of surgical gloves, 55 cartons of multivitamin syrup, 14 cartons of multivitamin mineral supplement, 25 cartons of vitamin-C tablets (100 mg), five cartons of vitamin-C glucose, 26 cartons of anti-malaria tablets, injection, suspension and suppositories, 16 cartons of antiseptic soap, four cartons of panagreen tablets suspensions (pain killers), five cartons of bisacodyl (anti-spasmodic) and seven cartons of anti-biotics/anti-microbial agent to the state,” he said.
