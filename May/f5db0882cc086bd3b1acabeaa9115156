Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja More than 1,000 graduate trainees recently recruited by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation are to assume duty from Monday. NNPC’s Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Kennie Obateru, disclosed this on Thursday in a statement issued in Abuja. He said the trainees would assume duty first virtually, while the corporation would monitor the COVID-19 situation and the Federal Government’s directives to determine a date of physical assumption of duty. Obateru said the option of virtual assumption of duty was necessitated by the need to comply with extant protocol on social distancing and reduced number of people in the workplace. Copyright PUNCH.
