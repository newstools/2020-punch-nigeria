Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission has developed a framework to address repeated operational conflicts between power distributors and the Transmission Company of Nigeria. Chairman of the commission, James Momoh, told our correspondent that the framework was developed when officials of the NERC, TCN and Abuja Electricity Distribution Company met in Abuja on Thursday. Momoh, who disclosed this in a telephone interview after the meeting, also stated that the conflict between the AEDC and the TCN was resolved by the commission. The TCN and the AEDC were recently engaged in a blame game over operational and power management issues affecting the networks of both companies. Asked whether the commission would engage other Discos that had been involved in disagreements with the TCN, Momoh replied, “Yes, we are going to do that too. “For today’s meeting, we were able to identify the common ground and challenges and came up with a framework that will be able to solve the problems together with all the Discos in the immediate future.” Explaining how the commission intervened in the disagreement between the TCN and AEDC, the NERC boss stated that all parties were made to understand each other’s challenges.
