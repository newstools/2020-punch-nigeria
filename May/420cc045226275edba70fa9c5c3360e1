The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, has faulted those criticising him for describing the recently repatriated Abacha loots as “Abacha assets”. Malami, in a statement issued by Dr Umar Gwandu, his Special Assistant on Media, on Wednesday, in Abuja said his attention had been drawn to the media reports relating to purported characterisation of the recovered assets associated with the former Head of State as “Abacha Assets”. He maintained that the choice of words was deliberate.

He said the return of the looted funds demonstrated not only commendable efforts of the present government, but also a pointer to the level of confidence, trust and respect the international community accorded the Buhari-led Federal Government.
