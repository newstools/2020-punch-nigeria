Toni Ufoh Olympic gold medalist, Dosu Joseph, has tasked the Nigeria Football Federation, Youths Sports Federation of Nigeria and corporate bodies to invest in secondary school sports. Speaking to Sunday PUNCH, the former Reggiana goalkeeper said the country needed to groom home-grown talents to compete favourably with other African nations. “Some of our Super Eagles players today did not even play in the local league. They went to Europe from their academies. This is something we should develop,” Dosu told Sunday PUNCH. “Secondary schools sports are the production ground. A bank has been in the forefront in this regard, but we need more input through sponsorship from investors. “When we do this, why would we not have good players in the national team? That’s what is obtainable in Europe,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
