Ebenezer Bajela Following confirmation from the Nigeria Football Federation that Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr, has signed a new two-year deal, former Tottenham Hotspur coach Harry Redknapp has denied speculations linking him with the three-time African champions’ job. Recent reports indicated that the 73-year-old English manager was being considered to take over from Rohr, whose contract was billed to expire in June. Redknapp was in Nigeria with Portsmouth in 2008 for a pre-season friendly match against Manchester United at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. Joined by Alan Brazil and Ally McCoist on Thursday’s talkSPORT Breakfast show, Redknapp said coming to Nigeria was the last thing on his mind, he was quizzed on the Eagles’ job. “Yeah, well I spoke to Sandra (Redknapp’s wife) and she’s always wanted to live in Nigeria,” he joked when he was asked about the Nigeria job. “She said it’s amazing that this has come up now, because that was her dream. So, we’re looking to sell up, we’re putting the house on the market and we’re looking to get somewhere over there if possible. “I’m sure, she’d love it there. I’ve told her, she’d absolutely love it… hehe! I’m ready to go!” On a serious note, Redknapp added, “I actually went there a few years ago with Portsmouth, we played Manchester United… but I don’t think I’ll really be going back.” Copyright PUNCH.
