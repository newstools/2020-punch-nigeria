James Abraham, Jos The Northern States Governors’ Forum has commiserated with the government and people of Kano State as well as the state Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs, over the death of the Emir of Rano, Alhaji Tafida Abubakar. The Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, in a statement on Sunday, described the death of the Emir as shocking and painful. He said, “We mourn the passing of the royal father, whose words of wisdom, and pursuit for peace and tolerance stood him out and endeared him to his subjects and people outside his domain. His death surely creates a huge vacuum as it came at a time when Kano State and his subjects needed him most for the fight against COVID-19, which is a major challenge confronting the state and the nation.” Lalong urged his Kano State counterpart, Abdullahi Ganduje, family of the deceased and the Emirate to be comforted by the wonderful legacies and good works of the deceased which he hoped, would be emulated and passed onto generations yet unborn. The forum also prayed that God would forgive the shortcomings of the late Emir and grant his soul eternal rest. The forum also expressed similar condolences to the government and people of Borno State over the death of the first civilian governor of the state, Alhaji Mohammed Goni, who died at the age of 78. The forum extolled his virtues of dedication, honesty and sacrifice to the development of Borno State where he laid a solid foundation for growth and prosperity. The NSGF extended their heartfelt sympathies to their colleague, Governor Babagana Zullum and prayed that God would comfort his family and grant his soul eternal rest. Copyright PUNCH.
