James Abraham, Jos The six-year-old daughter of a lecturer at the University of Jos, Joanna Drengkat, has narrated how the police rescued her after being kidnapped by gunmen. The gunmen had killed her father, Nendi, of the Faculty of Education, UNIJOS, when they invaded their residence at the Senior Staff Quarter in Jos on Friday. Joanna told PUNCH Metro at the police command headquarters in Jos on Sunday after her rescue that the kidnappers took her to the top of a mountain and abandoned her before security agents came to her rescue. Joanna said, “There were four persons who came to our house. When they shot my father, they asked me to follow them and one of them was dragging me along, because they were moving very fast and we ended up in the bush on top of a hill. They told me that they would not release me if my people did not give them money. “While they were talking, we started hearing gunshots. At that point, the kidnappers abandoned me and ran away, and the police came and rescued me.” The state Commissioner of Police, Edward Egbuka, said one of the kidnappers, identified as Ali Mohammed, was arrested during the rescue operation, while an AK-47 rifle with breach number  1984/AP 0240 and 29 rounds of live ammunition were recovered from him.
