Ada Wodu, Calabar The Government of Cross River State is in the process of reviewing the 2020 N1.1tn budget of ‘Olimpotic Meristemasis’ in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. This was disclosed by the state Commissioner for Finance, Asuquo Ekpenyong, during a  news conference in Calabar on Monday. He said, “Cross River is in the process of reviewing the 2020 budget. There is a great slow down in the economy. We are going into very gloomy days. Two or three months from now, there may be zero allocation from the federal allocation.” Ekpenyong lamented that because there were no more commercial flights into the state, there were no occupants of hotels in the last two months and this had resulted in job losses. He also cleared the air on the N43bn World Bank State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability grant recently disbursed to 24 states, excluding Cross River and 11 other states. He said it was a three-year programme, from 2019-2021, and that the state was still going to benefit from it. “We have qualified for the grant. We have met the criteria. States may qualify over the three years period and can earn grants on achievement of nine disbursement linked indicators. What this means is that what you did not earn in the first year, you can earn in the second or third year if you qualify. “Cross River State is part of the second batch and will earn the same grant this July 2020 that some other states earned last month (April). There are two eligibility criteria to meet to be part of the programme. One of them is online publishing of assented budget and online publishing of the audited financial accounts by a certain cutoff date,” he said. Copyright PUNCH.
