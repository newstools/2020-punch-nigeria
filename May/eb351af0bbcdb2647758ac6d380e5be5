Johnson Okafor The Nigerian Stock Exchange in collaboration with the International Finance Corporation has launched the Nigeria2Equal Programme with an inaugural seminar. The virtual seminar, themed, ‘Gender Implications of COVID-19: Supporting Women as Employees in the New Normal’, highlighted the socioeconomic impact the coronavirus on men and women, with women predicted to face more negative impact. Addressing concerns around women at home and in the workplace during this crisis, the Head, Shared Services Division at the NSE, Bola Adeeko, said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented changes in our lives and businesses. “There is, however, the valid concern that the current economic challenges will exacerbate gender inequality, especially because women are inappropriately represented in the informal sector and they are equally underrepresented in more senior levels of management in the corporate world. “This seminar, therefore, features a panel of seasoned and experienced experts to discuss best practices on how companies can develop the appropriate actions during and after this pandemic while realigning their business structures to the new realities.” Speaking on the need to advance gender equality, the Country Manager, IFC Nigeria, Eme Lore Essien, said, “In times of crisis, gender issues can sometimes be relegated to the backseat.
