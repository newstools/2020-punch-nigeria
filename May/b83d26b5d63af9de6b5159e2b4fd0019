’Femi Asu Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises need to deploy integrated technology to achieve optimal results with their business processes, the Chief Executive Officer, Crown Interactive, Wumi Oghoetuoma, has said. He said critical technology interventions would help businesses to thrive and overcome issues of inefficiency, leakages and poor service delivery. Ogboetuoma stated this at the unveiling of the company’s initiative, called CICOD Lyte, aimed at helping the MSMEs to grow, according to a statement. He said, “All organisations have business processes that enable them to deliver their products and services to their end-users. For many organisations in Nigeria, these processes are tracked manually, leading to inefficient operations, leakages and ultimately poor service delivery. “Today, large organisations such as Eko Electricity Distribution Company and others currently use the CICOD Lyte solution provided by Crown Interactive to manage their key business processes and track their revenue flow.” According to the statement, the solution provides customers with the ability to set up their online businesses immediately, manage orders, take payments and manage deliveries without the need for any technical skills. “Crown Interactive is offering fully integrated but modular systems that can be integrated into existing organisations’ software applications where required or operate independently to provide an unparalleled platform for automating key business processes,” Ogboetuoma said.
