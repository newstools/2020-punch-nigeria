TOBI AWORINDE The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Saturday, restated his commitment to the ideals of the freedom of the press, saying democracy thrives better in an atmosphere of transparency. The 2020 World Press Freedom Index compiled by an international non-governmental organisation, Reporters sans frontières (Reporters Without Borders), had ranked Nigeria 115th out of 180 countries in April. The index, which described Nigeria as a ‘climate of permanent violence,’ cited the killings of journalists and campaigns of disinformation as examples of the country’s attempts to weaken the press. But Buhari, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, made a recommitment to the media in commemoration of the World Press Freedom Day on May 3. According to the statement, the President reiterated the commendation he extended to the Nigerian media in his last two broadcasts to the country, applauding the good work they have done, and are still doing, as the nation confronts the COVID-19. The statement read, “On the part of the government, the President pledges a recommitment to the ideals of freedom of the press, noting that democracy thrives better in an atmosphere of transparency, as opposed to opacity.” Copyright PUNCH.
