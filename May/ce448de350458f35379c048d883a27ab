Solape Lawal-Solarin Super Eagles invitee, Cyriel Dessers, was a subject of bid from La Liga side, Celta Vigo, in January but his Dutch club, Heracles Almelo, has blocked any deal with the Spanish outfit. The Belgian-Nigerian was a key player in Heracles’ Eredivise campaign before Dutch football authorities cancelled the league due to the coronavirus pandemic. The cancellation of the league ensured the striker finished as joint-top scorer with 15 league goals. And Heracles director, Rob Touissant, has stated that they got an offer that failed to meet the club’s valuation for the striker from Celta. “In that period, we needed him desperately and the offer was not attractive enough. “Without Dessers, our continuity might have been jeopardised. With today’s science, everyone makes different choices, but that is afterwards,” Toussaint told Dutch outlet Tubantia. Dessers is on course to make his international debut for Nigeria in a 2021 AFCON qualifier against Sierra Leone when international football resumes. Copyright PUNCH.
