Maiharaji Altine, Gusau Zamfara State  Governor Bello Matawalle says  he is not happy with Almajirai’s  (street children) evacuated  from some northern states. He said those sent to their states of origin should relocate to Zamfara. Speaking  when he received two leading Islamic scholars, Sheikh Abdullahi  Dallah and Sheikh Bello Kanwa, who paid him Sallah homage in  Maradun, Matawalle said  his administration would give the street children a sense of belonging. A  statement by  his  Director-General, Media and Publicity, Mallam Yusuf Idris, quoted the governor as saying,  “My decision followed a careful study of the  Almajirai system in the state which only needs to be integrated into  western education for the purpose of acquiring quality   education in both western and Islamic knowledge. “I cancelled the repatriation  (expulsion) idea in order to give  Almajirai a sense of belonging and reduce the stigmatisation  being  meted  out to  the Almajiri Islamic teaching and learning in the country. “Almajirai have a right to quality education and  my administration is working hard to  reform the  Almajiri system of education. “I will not repatriate (expel)  them and I urge all those repatriated from other states to relocate to Zamfara.” Matawalle  urged  Islamic scholars to promote teaching of justice and unity among their followers for the purpose of having a united Nigeria. Dallah and Kanwa commended the governor for  his contribution to youth development. Copyright PUNCH.
