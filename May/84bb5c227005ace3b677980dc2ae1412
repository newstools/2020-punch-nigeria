Olaleye Aluko The Federal Ministry of Health has directed state governments to increase the number of isolation centres as the cases of COVID-19 soared to 2,950 on Wednesday. The Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, made this appeal at the ongoing daily briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja, noting that the country was largely presently dealing with community transmission of the coronavirus. The minister said, “The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria has continued to rise not unexpectedly, in view of prevailing circumstances in certain states. As at 11pm on May 5, 148 persons had tested positive, bringing the total to 2,950 confirmed to have COVID-19 in 34 states and the Federal Capital Territory. “We are encouraging and supporting states to increase the number of isolation centres nationwide, and we are extremely grateful to corporate organisations and philanthropists who have donated isolation facilities, diagnostic equipment, commodities and sundry supplies relevant to our response efforts to COVID-19 threat. “We are clearly in community transmission phase, where much now depends on individual and collective behaviour and the urgency of behaviour change communication becomes apparent. Knowledge so far gathered about COVID-19 needs to be converted into practice, because our safety, now more than ever, depends on all of us.”
