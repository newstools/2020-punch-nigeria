Chukwudi Akasike The University of Port Harcourt on Saturday denied knowing two of the three persons murdered by suspected cultists in a forest in Eleme Local Government Area of Rivers State. UNIPORT Spokesman, Dr. William Wodi, who gave this hint to PUNCH, maintained that the only student of the institution was Joy Adoki. Recall that three persons said to be students of UNIPORT were killed and buried in Eteo forest, Eleme LGA of the state by their assailants. The State Police Command had exhumed the decomposing bodies of Nelson Nwafor ‘m’, Fortune Obemba ‘m’, and Joy Adoki ‘f’, identifying them as undergraduates of UNIPORT, who were abducted on 7/4/2020 at Choba.
