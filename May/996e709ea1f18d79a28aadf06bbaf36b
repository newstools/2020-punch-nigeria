Tukur Muntari, Kano The  Kano State Public Complaint and Anti-corruption Commission is set  to  arraign Kumbotso Local Government Area  Chairman, Kabiru Panshekara,  for  allegedly  diverting  the relief materials meant for people in his   area to cushion the effects of the  coronavirus restrictions. A  source at the commission told our correspondent  on condition of anonymity on Tuesday that the embattled council chairman would  be arraigned  today (Wednesday). The source said, “We have finalised  the necessary arrangements to arraign the council chairman tomorrow (Wednesday). “We wanted to issue a statement but we don’t want to pre-empt the matter that is why we decided to leave the matter until we arraign him tomorrow.” The source, who declined to mention the court, however said the commission had filed a suit  against Panshekara over alleged criminal breach of trust and sundry offences. Meanwhile, the Kano State branch of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria  has expressed displeasure over the allegations against its members by the  anti-graft agency. The state ALGON chairman, Lamin Sani, in a statement said they  would no longer  be part of  the  palliative distribution committee to show  their  displeasure over the allegation. He said, “Our members will not be involved in any act that may hinder the state government’s effort to ease the suffering in the state  due to  the lockdown occasioned by COVID-19.” Copyright PUNCH.
