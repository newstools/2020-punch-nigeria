Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta For the third time consecutively, Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has extended the ‘eased lockdown’ in the state to further curb the spread of coronavirus. Abiodun revealed this on Friday noting that the new extension, which would commence on May 25 was hinged on the report of disobedience to government-ordered guidelines. He said, “I have to state that after all considerations, we are constrained to take the painful but necessary decision to continue the eased lockdown of Ogun State for another one week till Sunday, 31st, May 2020. “As we have always maintained the delicate balance between lives and livelihood, we will continue to have our window of relaxation, from 7am to 5pm on Monday, 25th May, 2020; Wednesday, 27th May, 2020 and Friday, 29th May, 2020.”
