Sodiq Oyeleke The Federal Government says coronavirus isolation and treatment centres in the country are running out of bed spaces. Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, revealed this on Friday during a briefing by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja. While delivering his address, Mustapha said efforts were being intensified to monitor the level of compliance of the Federal Government advisories and guidelines regarding the phased ease of lockdown in the country. He said the PTF met with heads of security agencies and asked them to ensure strict enforcement of the inter-state travel restrictions as part of efforts to curb the community transmission of the pandemic. Mustapha said, “The outcome of our surveillance still points to the fact that violations are still rampant and as I have always pointed out, portends a very dangerous trend.

This could be considered worrisome but for the fact that this rise is associated with our increased testing capacity, which has provided an opportunity to detect hitherto hidden cases. “However, this increased testing does not translate to higher fatality rates as in the last few days, we have witnessed a good number of discharges and a continually reducing daily fatality rate. “We have also received reports from the states, which suggests that the treatment centres are running out of bed spaces. As we assess the situation, the PTF shall also begin to examine our peculiar circumstances, modify the strategies for care management, and consider viable alternatives, where necessary. At the appropriate time, the guidelines and protocols shall be unfolded.”
