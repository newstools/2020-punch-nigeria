Godwin ISENYO, Kaduna. Kaduna State Government has re-adjusted the two-day window of the restriction of movement order, to allow residents to visit neighbourhood markets to purchase food and other essentials. A statement by the Managing Director of Kaduna Markets Development and Management Company, Muhammad Hafiz Bayero on Sunday, said that Wednesdays and Thursdays were now the two-day windows which the restriction of movement will be relaxed. This made it thrice the number of the times the state would re-adjust the two days window during the lockdown.

This adjustment means that no market will be open next Saturday,” he clarified. Bayero also said the temporary neighbourhood markets are to operate from 10 am to 4 pm on the two days on which the restriction of movement was relaxed. He, however, cautioned residents against not wearing face masks and non-compliance with other guidelines. He appealed “for compliance with this guideline, and other conditions including the need to wear facemasks and submit to temperature checks before entering the markets,” adding that physical distancing and other public health protocols should be complied with. Bayero pledged that the management would “make all the necessary arrangements for the orderly and safe conduct of trading activities at all the designated temporary neighbourhood markets.”
