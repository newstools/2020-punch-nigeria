Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Imo State Police Command has arrested a 47-year-old man, Uchenna Egbuchulem, for allegedly impregnating his teenage daughter. The spokesperson for the command, Orlando Ikeokwu, told PUNCH Metro on Wednesday in Owerri that the suspect would be charged with rape and incest. According to him, Uchenna, who hails from Nduhu, Alaenyi Ogwa, Mbaitoli Local Government Area of the state, forcefully had carnal knowledge of his 17- year-old daughter several times and impregnated her in the process. The police spokesperson said the wife of the suspect pulled out of the marriage and returned to her home country, Ivory Coast, which enabled him to sexually abuse the victim.

He was said to have forced her to bed by threatening to kill her with a machete. “Investigation into the incident has since commenced and he will be charged accordingly.” Copyright PUNCH.
