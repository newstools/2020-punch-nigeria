Johnny Edward The family members of the late Ifeanyi George will get between N15m and N20m insurance compensation as soon as the lockdown necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic is lifted, The PUNCH has learnt. Enugu Rangers midfielder George died in a ghastly auto crash along Asaba-Benin expressway on his way to Lagos after the club announced a break following the shutdown of all football activities in March. The PUNCH gathered that Emmanuel Ogbu, a Rangers B team player who also died in the car crash, was not insured by the former Nigerian champions, meaning his family would not receive any insurance compensation. “George’s family are expected to receive between N15m to N20m in compensation,” Rangers media and communications officer, Norbert Okolie, told The PUNCH. “Ogbu is a B-team player and was not insured,” he added. Meanwhile, Rangers General Manager, Davidson Owumi, said in a media statement made available to The PUNCH that the insurance company, Premier Brokers Limited, had paid the insurance premium claims on the death of George. “Despite the fact that we still mourn the sudden death of George, we are glad to announce that the club is in possession of the Insurance premium due for the immediate family of the late footballer, which will be presented as soon as the lockdown in almost all the states of the federation is relaxed,” Owumi stated.
