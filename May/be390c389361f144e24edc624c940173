Nike Popoola Lagos State Government through the Lagos State Internal Revenue Service says it has extended the deadline for filing of annual tax returns to June 30, 2020. A statement from the LIRS’s Head, Corporate Communications, Monsurat Amasa, said this was part of Lagos State’s effort to provide the needed relief to taxpayers and mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Annual tax returns for individuals (both employees and self-employed persons) initially due on May 31could now be filed on or before the June 30, it stated. The Executive Chairman, LIRS, Mr Ayodele Subair, said, “As the Lagos State Government keeps abreast of global best practices in containing the COVID-19 pandemic and eases the effects of an economic downturn on taxpayers and residents of the state, the LIRS had initially extended the deadline for filing annual tax returns for two months, from the statutory March 31 of every fiscal year to May 31, 2020. “We constantly debated what other measures could be taken as an organisation to support individuals and businesses at this time, hence, the additional one-month extension from June 1, to June 30, 2020. It is our sincere hope that taxpayers take advantage of this new extension to duly file their returns.” Copyright PUNCH.
