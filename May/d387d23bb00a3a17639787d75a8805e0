Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Police Command, on Wednesday, said it rescued the naval officer, who was kidnapped in the state last week. The naval officer, identified as Lieutenant Commander Ajare Amadi, was abducted by gunmen at the Ago Ajayi village on the Ikare-Owo Expressway, Akoko South West Local Government Area of the state. The gunmen contacted the officer’s family and demanded N50m as ransom. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Undie Adie, said the naval officer was released on Wednesday following pressure on the abductors by the police. “His (Amadi) release was sequel to the aggressive manhunt the command and other sister agencies launched for his abductors, who on realising that there was no place to hide any longer, abandoned him in the forest and took to their heels,” he stated. Adie warned travellers to strictly obey to the ban on interstate movement imposed by the Federal Government as a means of limiting the spread of COVID-19 “as these bad boys are using the advantage of the empty roads to carry out their nefarious acts.” He said the command would never allow the state to be a place where criminals would operate without being tracked down.
