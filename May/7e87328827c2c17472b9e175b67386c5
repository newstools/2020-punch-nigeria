Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, has said the ruling All Progressives Congress should remain in the saddle because of its anti-corruption stance, which has created public awareness about the evil of corruption. Akanbi said this while receiving a team led by the Osun State Commissioner for Education Mr Folorunso Oladoyin, during an inspection visit to the proposed permanent site of the newly-approved Federal College of Education, Iwo, on Tuesday. A statement by the Press Secretary to the Oluwo, Alli Ibrahim, quoted the monarch as saying, “I left Nigeria in the 1980s for greener pasture because of corrupt leaders presiding over our affairs. I’m happy that the new hope is here and so elated to be part of the promising structure. “For now, the progressives should continue ruling. There is a public awareness against corruption.” Copyright PUNCH.
