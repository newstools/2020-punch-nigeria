The NPF is at the forefront of ensuring that various measures taken by the government are respected and enforced, in line with Nigerian law and international human rights standards, and therefore needs additional protective equipment. “This is only a modest donation but we hope it will facilitate the NPF s work, and it is also a gesture of solidarity with the policemen and women who are at the frontline, and with the Nigerian people as a whole,” said Ambassador Kulitz. The Missions explained that the donation is part of a joint three-year programme that aims at strengthening the NPF, with a focus on capacity building in the area of forensics, processes, and procedures for criminal investigation, human rights, as well as strengthening cooperation mechanisms.
