Samson Folarin A commercial bus with number plate FKJ 352 XA has been impounded by the police in Ogun State after its driver hit a Volvo V40 belonging to a PUNCHman, Agboola Bakare. The bus is owned by a transport company, Constant Link Ventures. Our correspondent gathered that the bus driver fled the scene and abandoned the 12 passengers he was conveying from Lagos to Onitsha, Anambra State. Bakare said the incident happened at the OPIC end of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway around 3.03pm on Sunday. He said, “I was on the road when I suddenly heard a loud bang at the rear of my car. I stepped out of the car to see the level of damage. I, however, observed that the bus driver overtook me and tried to escape. “I looked at the front and was happy that there was a police checkpoint ahead of him. But the daredevil driver sped through the policemen and their barricade. If not for God’s intervention, he would have crushed one of the policemen, Corporal Yau.” Policemen from the Ojodu Abiodun Police Station were said to have given the suspect a chase. The police team caught up with the driver in front of the PUNCH Place, Magboro. Bakare added, “The driver of the Constant Link Ventures bus, seeing that the game was up, got out of the bus and took to his heels to an unknown destination, leaving the innocent passengers stranded. “Around 4.12pm, the bus and my car were taken to the Ojodu Abiodun Police Station, where my details were taken.” Copyright PUNCH.
