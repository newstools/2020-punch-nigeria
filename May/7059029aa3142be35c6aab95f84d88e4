Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Thursday said it was regrettable to record the ongoing staff reduction and wage cut in the country’s aviation sector. Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, said this in his message to employees in the aviation industry as they join their peers in celebrating Workers Day. In a statement issued by the Director, Public Affairs, Federal Ministry of Aviation, James Oduadu, the minister stated that the ugly situation was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement read in part, “According to the minister, it is highly regrettable that airlines and other service providers were being forced to cope with the option of either sending their staff on compulsory leaves or reduction of their wages as occasioned by the redundancy caused by COVID-19 scourge.” Sirika said the Federal Government was aware of the dire situation in the aviation sector and would do whatever was practically possible to mitigate the consequences of the total lockdown in the industry.
