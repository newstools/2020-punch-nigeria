Tony Okafor, Awka The Anambra State Waste Management Company has sacked no fewer than 8,000 casual workers. The Managing Director of the company, Mr Emeka Ajekwu, disclosed this to reporters on Thursday in Awka, the Anambra State capital. Ajekwu said,  “The pandemic has adversely affected our  operations as we lack access to production materials.” He said the company  signed  a waste recycling contract of $1.1m with  the Anambra State Government in 2019. He explained that the company shutdown in February to avoid exposing its frontline workers to danger of the pandemic. Ajekwu added, “We also shutdown because most of our products come from across the state and what we produce are evacuated to other states. “We are facing difficulties because of boundary closure. We don’t have access to raw materials. In fact, we don’t have access to waste products again. So, it’s really affecting our business and as a consequence we were compelled to downsize workers. “We are pleading with the state government to intervene so that  the sacked workers can be reinstated because they have their needs to meet and some of them earn below N500 daily. “We are asking government to extend palliative measures to our workers. We have  urged them all to go into agriculture and key into the agric policies of  the Anambra State Government.” Copyright PUNCH.
