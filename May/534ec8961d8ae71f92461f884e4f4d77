Kayode Oyero The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, SAN, has said the introduction of another total lockdown in parts of the country would be counterproductive. The PUNCH reports that confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria spilled over 4,000 on Saturday night, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. A cumulative half of these infections were recorded in Lagos and Ogun States as well as the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The three places entered a new phase on Monday, May 4, after a five-week total lockdown ordered by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as part of measures to curb the community transmission of the virus. The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 subsequently issued guidelines on the phased easing of the lockdown in the three places but compliance on the part of Nigerians has been poor in the last one week.

However, commenting on Sunday via Twitter, Keyamo said another total lockdown is unnecessary as Nigerians must learn to live with the virus and practice the guidelines including observing social distancing, avoiding crowded places, use of face masks in public, regular hygiene, amongst other. “My personal view is that another total lockdown would be counterproductive. Before defeating the virus, we must learn to live with it all around us and practice the skills of avoiding it like a landmine. Practice makes perfect. We cannot perfect those skills by locking ourselves up,” he tweeted. See tweet:
