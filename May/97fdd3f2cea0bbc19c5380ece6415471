Kelvin Ekerete Former Super Eagles captain, Mikel Obi, is on the radar of top Mexican clubs, including league champions Monterrey. According to reports from Diego Medina, a reporter for Mexican media outfit, TUDN, the midfielder is being closely followed by a team from the countryâ€™s capital and could be considered as a major signing for the club. The club could make a move for the Nigerian before the resumption of the Mexican league, after the COVID -19 pandemic. Mikel is currently a free agent after terminating his contract with Turkish club, Trabzonspor, in March 2020, after he called for the Turkish league to be cancelled, in the wake of the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The former Chelsea and Middlesbrough defensive midfielder has also been on the radar of Brazilian clubs Botafogo and Internacional. The Nigerian had in April confirmed interests from Brazilian side Botafogo but was only going to give consent if the decision was right for his family. Mikel was a key figure for Trabzonspor during his time in Turkey, playing 19 times and helping them to the top of the league table, before parting ways with them. Mikel has played a total of 455 games at club level in Norway, England, China, and Turkey, scoring 11 goals, with 18 assists. Copyright PUNCH.
