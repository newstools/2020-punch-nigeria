Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja A Peoples Democratic Party aspirant in the 2019 Kogi State Governorship election, Abubakar Ibrahim, on Thursday, described his “purported expulsion” by the party in his Icheke ward, as part of a plot to frustrate his quest to pursue his “stolen mandate.” Ibrahim, the son of former Kogi State governor, Ibrahim Idris said those behind the plot were playing out a script meant to arm-twist him into withdrawing his legal challenge of the outcome of the 2019 PDP primary. This was contained in a statement released by his media team, in Lokoja. It read in part, “The attention of Alhaji Abubakar Ibrahim, claimant to the People’s Democratic Party, PDP ticket in the November 2019 Governorship election in Kogi State has been drawn to media reports on his purported expulsion from the party. “The so-called exercise was allegedly orchestrated by the party EXCO in his Icheke Ward of Omala Local Government chaired by Sunday Idakwoji. “The grounds for the action are summarised as ‘anti-party activities.’ The Icheke speculators accused Abubakar of challenging the outcome of the PDP governorship primaries in Court without resorting to the party. They also blamed him for not attending meetings and not being a financial member of the party. “Of course, these allegations are not only completely untrue but a clear case of an attempt to give dog a bad name in order to make it fit for the slaughter slab. It is the height of political voodooism, brigandage and oppressive impunity.” The statement also described claims that he went to court without first exploring internal party conflict resolution mechanisms as false. Abubakar said he petitioned the party in search of justice but was ignored. Copyright PUNCH.
