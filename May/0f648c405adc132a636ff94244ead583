Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo The Taraba Police Command on Friday said men of the command attached to Bali division killed eight suspected kidnappers in a gun battle. The state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP David Misal, said the operation followed an intelligence report about the kidnappers’ activities. He said, “Reliable intelligence indicated that a group of kidnappers armed with sophisticated weapons had concluded plans to kidnap some residents of Bali town. “On receipt of the information, the Divisional Police Officer mobilised his men and swung into action. “During a surveillance patrol around Gazabu, they intercepted the kidnappers on their way to actualise their plans. On sighting the policemen, they opened fire on them which led to an exchange of fire. “Eight of the kidnappers were badly wounded and later confirmed dead by a medical doctor.” Misal said two AK-47 rifles, four magazines, two single barrel guns, 44 rounds of live ammunition, four cartridges, four handsets, army camouflage uniforms and other items were recovered from the suspected kidnappers.
