Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The All Progressives Congress member representing Sokoto East Senatorial District, Ibrahim Gobir, on Tuesday, has said the Nigerian military was no longer capable of saving his people from bandits. Gobir stated this on the floor of the Senate while seconding the motion moved by the Deputy Chief Whip, Sabi Abdullahi, on the order given by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, (retd.), to the Nigerian soldiers to flush out bandits from some states. The Senator said his people now rely on the soldiers from Niger Republic to ward off the attacks of bandits whenever the hoodlums struck. He said, “There is no protection for my people in the Sokoto East Senatorial District because of the incessant attacks of the bandits. “At least 300 people have either been killed or kidnapped in the last three months while over 5,780 cows valued at N2.5bn had been stolen. “We are even appealing to the Federal Government through the Senate for reparation.
