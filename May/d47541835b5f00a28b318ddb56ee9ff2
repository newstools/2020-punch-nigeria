John Alechenu The Peoples Democratic Party has given the  Federal Government a 48-hour ultimatum to reveal  the whereabouts of the Chinese doctors   brought  to  help  fight   COVID-19 spread   in  the country. The PDP predicated it’s position on what it described as the “alarming” declaration by the Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, that he could not  account for the whereabouts of the Chinese team despite protests by the Nigerian Medical Associations and others. This was contained in a statement by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbodiyan,  on Saturday. He said, the minister’s statement had heightened fears  that the Chinese, whose identity and activities had been shrouded in secrecy, might have been brought in by some people  for another purpose. The statement read in part, “The party described as suspicious, creepy and weird that the minister of health, who had repeatedly assured  (Nigerians) that the Chinese were brought to render medical services and training, and even went  to receive them at the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja, on April 8 in an elaborately publicised event can no longer account for the team.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
