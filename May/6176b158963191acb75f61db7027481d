Sodiq Oyeleke Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, says the state is making use of some private facilities as isolation centres. He, however, clarified that some of the facilities were unknown to the public. This, the governor said, was to ensure that the facilities used were not stigmatised after COVID-19. Sanwo-Olu made this known during a televised briefing on Sunday at the State House in Marina. He explained that easing the lockdown was to maintain a “delicate balance”. While reacting to a question on the availability of bed spaces in Lagos, Sanwo-Olu said, “There have been several conversations. People wrote that Lagos is out of bed spaces, but the very next day we opened another isolation centre. We are opening another isolation centre for the health workers.

We do not want a situation where post-COVID, it becomes a stigmatised place. people are going there and they are getting well.” The PUNCH reports that the Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Chikwe Ihekweazu, earlier raised an alarm that there was a shortage of bed spaces in Lagos, Kano and Abuja. During one of the daily Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 briefings last week, the NCDC boss said, “Concerning the availability of bed spaces for the management of patients, there is no doubt that we are struggling in certain places especially in Lagos State, and to an extent Kano and Abuja. But the biggest challenge right now is in Lagos where bed spaces are really tight.” Sanwo-Olu urged members of the public to report any erring company to the government through the State’s whistleblowing policy. The governor, however, said that there was no financial gain for whistleblowers in the state.
