Solape Lawal-Solarin Former Super Eagles stars Garba Lawal and Mutiu Adepoju, as well as ex-national team coach, Adegboye Onigbinde, have showered encomiums on late striker, Rashidi Yekini, eight years after he passed on. The former Vitoria Setubal striker, Nigeria’s all-time top scorer with 37 goals in 58 games, died at 48 on May 8, 2012. Yekini was named the 1993 African Player of the Year and was top scorer as Nigeria claimed a second AFCON title in 1994. He holds the record of scoring the country’s first ever World Cup goal, grabbing the opener against Bulgaria as the Eagles cruised to a 3-0 win. “It’s an honour to have played with him in the national team. Having watched him in Kaduna and getting to play in the Eagles with him is a great honour for me,” Lawal, Yekini’s teammate at the 1998 World Cup, said. “I always admired him as a player, we were always together, I do go into his room to talk. Yekini remains my best player.” In a Twitter message, ex-Eagle midfielder Adepoju said,“Dear mate, I feel honoured playing with you in Nigerian colours and that was a big achievement on its own. You gave your 100 pet cent always. Onigbinde, who gave  Yekini his first invitation to the Eagles, added,“I brought him into the national team in 1983 when I took the team to Kaduna for a friendly. He is a quiet, peculiar character, but was always ready to give his all for the team. He was a diligent and committed player. His exit is a great loss.” Copyright PUNCH.
