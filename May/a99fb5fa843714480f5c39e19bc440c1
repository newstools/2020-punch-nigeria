The Nigeria Labour Congress has appealed to the Kwara Government to ensure immediate and full implementation of the N30,000 minimum wage to its workers. The union said the implementation must be done in the face of the economic hardship as a result of the coronavirus lockdown in the state. The congress made the appeal in a statement issued by the state chapter chairman, Alhaji Issa Ore, to commemorate the 2020 May Day celebration on Friday in Ilorin. The union also sought the implementation of the new wage alongside other demands pending before the state government. “In the face of the hardship which Nigerians are currently going through as a result of the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19 and its effects on the economy, we want to appeal to the state government to ensure the implementation of the N30,000 minimum wage for workers,” Ore said.
