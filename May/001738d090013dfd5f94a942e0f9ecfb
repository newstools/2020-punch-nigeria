Solape Lawal-Solarin Super Eagles defender, Ola Aina, admits his slim chances at getting a call-up into the English national team, Three Lions, prompted him to switch to Nigeria. Aina is one of the few foreign players of Nigerian descent to commit their international future to the West African nation. “England was never going to give me a chance to play for the senior team, that’s the difference. Nigeria gave me the pathway to play for their senior team,” Aina said in an Instagram Live chat with the Super Eagles Media Team. “I probably would have made it there at some point but Nigeria told me I can make it here now, it was a no-brainer.” Another foreign import to switch international allegiance to Nigeria is Liverpool-owned midfielder Ovie Ejaria, who was born in London like the former Chelsea player. Ejaria’s switch seems to have Aina’s blessing. “Yes, if you have the roots and from Nigeria, you should be welcomed to play for Nigeria, no one should be felt like they are pushed aside.” The defender picked Villarreal winger Samuel Chukwueze as his most difficult opponent in the Super Eagles training sessions. “I would say Samuel Chukwueze, he is a tricky player even in training, he is business-minded.” Copyright PUNCH.
