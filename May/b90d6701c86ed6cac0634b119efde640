Success Nwogu, Abuja The lawmaker representing Obokun/Oriade Federal Constituency of Osun State, Wole Oke, has appealed to the Federal Government to provide urgent grants for Oyo and Osun states to enable them to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Oke made the appeal in an interview with journalists in Abuja, on Monday. He noted that the two states had  managed the limited resources available to them very well to the admiration of many. Oke, who chairs the House Committee on Public Accounts and a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, commended the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, for his approach in the management of COVID-19. He said, “These states have utilised the resources available to them very well to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. I am calling on the Federal Government to give special grants to the states to be able to combat the pandemic head-on “Their prudent management of the resources at their disposal is commendable. The Federal Government should lend a helping hand to them; it is our enemy for now and we have collectively combated it without playing dirty politics with its eradication. “I also want to commend Governor Seyi Makinde for a job well done and I am appealing to other states to emulate the governor and copy his style of managing the pandemic.” The lawmaker earlier donated N15m worth of bags of rice to the Osun State Committee on COVID-19.
