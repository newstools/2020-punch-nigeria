AC Milan revealed on Saturday that none of their first-team footballers or staff were positive for coronavirus, a day after the club’s president said that some players were recovering from the disease. In a statement, the seven-time European champions said that “based on the medical tests carried out so far on both the first team players and staff, there have not been any positive cases of COVID-19”. Milan added that the team would continue the individual training programmes that they and other Serie A clubs had begun this week in the hope they can complete the 2019-20 this summer.
