We are now seeing above 100 cases per day. This shows our graph is moving in a gentle incline upwards. “We definitely have not reached the peak of our outbreak, we suspect that the peak will happen sometime in July or August and so we are preparing for the oncoming of about 90,000 to 120,000 cases during that period. We are increasing our capacity and strategies to deal with this situation.” The commissioner urged residents not to panic over the increasing cases witnessed in the state, saying it was caused by the presence of sample collection centres in 20 Local Governments. He stated that Alimosho, Oshodi and Isolo local governments have started having more COVID-19 cases, adding that a majority of the dead patients in the state were males.
