Anna Okon Clearing agents operating at the airports have stopped work over what they called the refusal of handling companies to implement the presidential order directing demurrage waivers for goods stored in the airport warehouses during the COVID-19 lockdown. Our correspondent gathered that the agents who had last been at work on May 4 decided not to work another day because, according to them, the handling companies requested that they pay demurrage for the period of the lockdown. “The Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents met today (Tuesday) and took a stand that since the Minister of Aviation is not doing his work, the freight forwarders will down tools concerning Customs clearance of all goods that came into the country before the lockdown,” the Secretary, Murtala Mohammed International Airport chapter, ANLCA, Emmanuel Njoku, told our correspondent. Our correspondent had reported on Monday that over N2bn demurrage had accumulated on goods stored at the airport warehouses for five weeks of the lockdown. Copyright PUNCH.
