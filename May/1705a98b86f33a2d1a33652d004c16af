Sola Shittu, Benin Fifty four workers of Igbinedion University Teaching Hospital IUTH, Okada, Edo State, have been served sacked letters by the institution, following the ravaging coronavirus pandemic and the dwindling Internal Generated Revenue of the institution. According to one of the sacked workers (name withheld) who spoke with The Punch, he said out of 240 workers, almost 150 appointments were terminated. “I am among those sacked. Anybody that is 60 years and above and anybody that has one or two queries in his/her file were also affected. “Out of about 240 workers, almost 150  got their appointments terminated due to coronavirus, low IGR and they said it’s another avenue to restructure the system. They also said the wage bill is too high,” he said. But the Public Relations Officer, IUTH, Mr Uyi Osaretin, while confirming the sacking of the workers to The Punch, said only 54 members of staff were affected. He added that the exercise was on-going. “It’s not up to 150 that were sacked, that is speculation. It’s around 54 as at yesterday but I know the second phase is coming which will affect the medical personnel, the doctors and the consultants.” “We are going to get many of the people back but for now, we cannot continue to pay N28m and yet cannot make up to N5m per month.” Copyright PUNCH.
