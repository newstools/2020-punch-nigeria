Toni Ufoh Galatasaray forward Henry Onyekuru has refused a move to Greek side, Olympiakos. The Nigerian, who is on loan at Turkish giants, Galatasaray, from Monaco, was primed for a possible move to the Piraeus-based side. However, it’s been reported by Fanatik that the former Everton forward rejected the move. The Nigerian had indicated that he wanted to stay with Galatasaray instead of returning to Monaco. He said, “I wanted to stay in Galatasaray last year, but my club Everton sold me to Monaco. I almost never played in Monaco. I do not want to experience the same frustration again.” Fanatik also revealed that Fatim Terim wants the Nigerian to remain at the club. “I want Onyekuru to stay in the team, whatever the way,” Terim was quoted as saying.
