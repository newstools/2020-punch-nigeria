Some users of the Bus Rapid Transit on Friday in Lagos decried the shortage of buses being released for services since the ease of lockdown on May 4. The commuters told the News Agency of Nigeria in separate interviews at the BRT Bus Stations that inadequate deployment of the buses had increased the time they spent in queues. A commuter, Mr Tope Musowo, lamented that passengers were subjected to long wait in queues at the station, as most of the BRT high-capacity buses seemed to have disappeared. Musowo stated, “These days, passengers are kept at bus stops for hours. For instance, today (Friday), I was in queue for about two hours. It is that bad.” Another BRT user, Mrs Olubunmi Olaniyan, said the scarcity of buses was worrisome. “I was late for an office appointment while awaiting a BRT bus. I think the state government should look into this. Productive hours are being wasted in queues,” she said. Also, a CMS-bound commuter, Mr Solomon Eromosele, said transportation had not returned to normal since the ease of the lockdown, calling for the state government’s urgent intervention. “If the firm needs the government’s support, I think the government should do that for BRT to function well for the benefit of the masses,” he said. The BRT Managing Director, Mr Fola Tinubu, said the way the firm was currently operating as if it was running a social service to the people. “Carrying 20 passengers on the bus at the same old rates is not sustainable. We are piling up losses that we need to address urgently. “Creditors are calling us; we need to address that urgently also. The way it is right now is not sustainable. That was why we have limited buses on the road today (Friday). Every bus that is going up and down now is incurring many losses,” he said. The state government had mandated the 70-capacity buses to carry only 21 passengers with the driver as a social distancing measure to curb spread of COVID-19.
