Gibson Achonu, Owerri Following the defection of former executive members of the Imo State branch of the Peoples Democratic Party, the party has said that the PDP is intact and strong, adding that the defectors are inconsequential. The party also advised the All Progressives Congress to be wary of the defectors, describing them as “gold diggers, bed bugs and buccaneers, who never add value to any organization.” “The exit from our party is a relief and positive development for our great party because, for long, they have remained huge liabilities to the great party,” the Chairman of the party, Chief Martin Ejiogu, said. Erstwhile PDP executives who reportedly decamped to the APC include the former state party Chairman, Chief Charles Ezekwem; the state Legal Adviser, Jerry Egemba; National ex-officio, Chief Leo Awaziema and the Youth Leader, Mr Williams Ahanonu. But addressing a press conference in Owerri on Friday, Ejiogu stated that the defectors constituted “a band of Senator Samuel Anyanwu’s loyalists, who worked against the interest of the party during the 2019 general elections.” “Besides, they have in principle left the party a long time ago; what played out was a mere drama, a dummy from a script that had been written months before now. However, their claim that they defected as officers of our great party is a clear misrepresentation, fallacy and the height of mischief,” the party chieftain argued. Copyright PUNCH.
