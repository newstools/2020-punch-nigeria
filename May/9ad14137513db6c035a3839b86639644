Bauchi State Primary Healthcare Development Agency says the state government spends N1,500 per meal for COVID-19 patients on admission in the state. Executive Chairman of the agency, Dr Rilwanu Mohammed, disclosed this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria in Bauchi on Sunday. Mohammed, who is also the Chairman, contact tracing Committee on COVID-19 in the state, said Governor Bala Mohammad gave the directives in order to ensure that all the COVID-19 patients in the state were well fed. He said the idea was to make sure that they feel more at home and avoid a replica protest or revolt by COVID-19 patients in some other states.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the state, as of Saturday, May 24, had recorded 232 confirmed cases of COVID-19; 164 had been discharged so far, five deaths, with 63 active cases.  NAN
