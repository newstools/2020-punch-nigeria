Kayode Oyero The Federal Government has said the first and second batch of evacuees into the country have come to the end of their 14-day supervised quarantine period. The PUNCH reports that the first batch of 256 Nigerians was evacuated from Dubai to Lagos State on May 6 while the second batch of 253 citizens was repatriated from the UK to Abuja on May 8. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, said on Thursday that the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has directed Commissioners of Police in the two cities to ensure the seamless travel of the evacuees to their respective states across the Federation. The minister, who disclosed this during a briefing by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja, said the Force bosses in the two places would give them “personalised passes” to travel to their states of domicile without having to encounter challenges with security operatives who are currently enforcing the ban on interstate movement in the country. He said, “As they’ve come to the end of the 14 days quarantine, I spoke to the Inspector-General of Police and he was very helpful because some of them will have to travel across state lines and that has been a source of concern for them. “But the IG of Police has directed the Commissioners of Police of the two cities which they are located – that is Abuja and Lagos – to receive them individually and give them personalised passes and phone numbers that they can reach if they have any problems at any of the borders going home. We are hopeful that they will not have any issues as they go back.” The PUNCH reports that four batches of evacuees have been received so far since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. While the third batch of 160 evacuees came in from the US and arrived in Abuja on May 10, the fourth batch of 292 citizens came in from Saudi Arabia and also arrived in Abuja on May 19.
