Tobi Aworinde The Nigerian Medical Association has called for the withdrawal of the Infectious Diseases Control Bill 2020 by the House of Representatives. Several prominent Nigerians and organisations have protested the controversial bill. The NMA, in a statement by its President, Dr Francis Faduyile, and Secretary General, Dr Olumuyiwa Odusote, on Saturday, stated that public hearing is one of the hallmarks of democracy. It said, “NMA appreciates the sense of urgency and purpose of the House of Representatives in enacting strong legislation to fill the void in the existing ones. The association is thankful to the leadership of the House and the health-related committees but instead opts for broader consultation with relevant stakeholders to have a law that will be implementable and not in conflict with the constitution. “NMA is not embarrassed by the public outcry against specific provisions of the bill as such is one of the hallmarks of democracy and welcomes the resolve of the House to subject the bill to a public hearing. We further urge that the withdrawal of the bill entirely and redrafting to remove any existing and future doubts in the people.” Copyright PUNCH.
