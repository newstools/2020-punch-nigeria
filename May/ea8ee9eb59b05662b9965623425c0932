Mudiaga Affe Siemens Energy Limited has reiterated its commitment to support Nigeria’s oil and gas sector in this critical period of COVID-19. The energy giant said it ensured that during the period of the lockdown, customers’ plants and sites were kept running uninterrupted in its locations nationwide. Vice-President, Service and Digital, Siemens Energy Limited, Mr Seun Suleiman, in a statement on Saturday said the feat was made possible because the company had successfully localised its field operations in Nigeria. He said, “It is amazing to share with you the business advantage of localising the field ops organisation in Nigeria, especially with the pandemic of COVID-19. We have been able to successfully meet most of our customer field service interventions without any hindrance and these FSRs have been fully supported via in-country tier 1 technical support. “This has significantly kept us in operation despite the suspension of international flights in Nigeria and the multiple curfews imposed in Lagos and Port Harcourt. We are immensely proud of our front-line employees working hard on all our customers’ sites to keep the lights on for millions of Nigerians during these difficult times.” The company’s Head of Business Development, Mr Oladayo Orolu, also highlighted the importance of essential utilities running during the lockdown period.
