Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The General Overseer of The Saints Gospel Church of Christ, aka Hand of Fire Ministries, in Igando, Lagos State, Pastor Jacob Shodeinde, has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to reopen churches closed down in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak in the country. The cleric, who stated this in an interview with our correspondent on Monday, said the reopening of churches was necessary because the COVID-19 pandemic would only be solved through spiritual means. He described churches as spiritual worship centres where angels of God visit from time to time to convey people’s problems to God for solutions. He said, “Only prayers can solve the problem of COVID-19. I have sent a personal message to the Lagos State Governor that he should consider opening of churches so that we could end coronavirus pandemic with prayers. “God told me to tell those in authorities, particularly President Muhammadu Buhari, that they should reopen the churches because the solution to COVID-19 is in the House of God where the angels are waiting for the people. “Churches should not be shut. Those who heard heavenly calling would understand the mystery surrounding the church, particularly, the fact that angels build special structures within the physical churches. “Those who thought that we are clamouring for church reopening because of tithes and offerings got it wrong because I’m not money conscious. In fact, I don’t preach prosperity, but holiness.” Copyright PUNCH.
