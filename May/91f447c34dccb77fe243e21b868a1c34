’Femi Asu The Lagos State Government has said it is set to stop the incessant truck accidents taking the lives of innocent citizens. The government said it convened a stakeholders’ meeting with key representatives of the downstream energy sector to deepen safety awareness of operators, given the spate of fire incidents involving petroleum tankers in recent times. “Mr Governor is keen to see the downstream sector continue to flourish in the state but operators must stay within the framework of safety provided by the regulators and the laws of the state,” the Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr Olalere Odusote, was quoted in a statement on Thursday as saying. Odusote said the workshop was put together to address the recurrence of such hazardous incidents and to seek effective and lasting solutions that would align the interests of all stakeholders. He disclosed that the state government had commenced the process of creating fully equipped truck transit parks and terminals to eliminate the indiscriminate parking of trucks in the state. According to him, a technology-based Integrated Terminal Management System, where tickets are issued prior to proceeding to the loading bays, will be introduced, in addition to the enforcement of the annual certifications for tanker drivers and trucks that ply Lagos roads. Odusote said the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources would work closely with all stakeholders to implement an optimal framework to curb the menace of tankers. Copyright PUNCH.
