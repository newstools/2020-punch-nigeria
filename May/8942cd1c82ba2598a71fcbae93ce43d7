The Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation has expressed support for the implementation of the recommendations of the Presidential Panel on Rationalisation and Restructuring of Federal Government Parastatals headed by a former Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Mr Steve Oronsaye. Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said recently that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, (retd.) had approved the recommendations and the implementation is due to commence in October 2020. The report recommended, among others, that the NTDC should be fully commercialised for a new direction for tourism management in Nigeria. Director-General of the NTDC, Mr Folorunsho Coker, said in a statement that his team was ready for the recommended changes. He said, “As a nation, we need to consider and deploy innovative recovery solutions that are homegrown and practical, tailor-made for our specific environment and people.” According to the statement, given the new normal expected in the post-COVID-19 travel and tourism industry, an NTDC under a direct supervision of the Presidency will be expeditious in delivering its responsibilities. Coker said priority would be given to tourism, thereby sending a message to the international community that Nigeria was ready for tourism, as well as sensitise Nigerians to the need to embrace tourism for job creation, poverty alleviation and overall improvement of the economy. “If suitable strategies are deployed, tourism can emerge from this current crisis as an even more important contributor to the 2030 Agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals, supporting livelihoods and creating opportunities for millions of people around the world and leaving nobody behind,” the NTDC boss said.
