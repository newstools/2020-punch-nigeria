Patrice Evra has revealed that he “begged for money in front of shops” when he was homeless as a youngster in Paris, but insists he “wouldn’t change anything about his upbringing” because it helped him to develop a strong character. Evra enjoyed a hugely successful playing career spanning 20 years, with spells taken in at Monaco, Manchester United and Juventus. The pacey defender spent his prime years at Old Trafford, helping the club win 15 trophies in total, including five Premier League titles and the Champions League. “I’ll be honest with you, it was a tough childhood because I’ve got many brothers and sisters, so it wasn’t easy living in the street,” the 38-year-old told United’s official podcast. “I was in Paris but living in the streets and sometimes I wasn’t even able to have some food. “I remember my brother Dominique was working at a McDonalds and so I was going there and on his lunch break he was giving me his own food. “I’m not scared to say that I’ve begged for money in front of shops. I’ve been in front of shops and when I’ve seen some people I’ve said, ‘Can I have a Euro?’ and sometimes they were giving me the money and sometimes not, just because I wanted to buy a sandwich. “It was a tough time, but a happy time. I was always happy and always felt lucky, I wouldn’t change anything, I would keep it that way because it built the man I am.”
