Hindi Livinus, Yola The Adamawa State Government has commenced the movement of over 400 Almajirai back to their states of origin. The Secretary to Adamawa State Government, Bashiru Ahmad, made this known on Wednesday during the start of the relocation of some street kids from the state to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Most of the Almajirai to be sent back to their home states are from nearby Gombe State. Bashiru said the move by the Adamawa State Government was in line with the agreement reached by the Northern State Governors Forum. He said, “The way and manner these children are accommodated and mingle amongst people in the markets and within our communities are considered a very high health risk. “That is why the governors decided that this is the right time to do that, so that every state takes direct responsibility of its own citizens, and all states have put the measure in place to take back those that are not their own and receive those that are theirs and also plan to integrate Quranic teaching into western education.” The Adamawa State Government said prior to the repatriation of these set of Almajirai from the state, it took note that some the northern  state governors had repatriated some street kids who are believed to have originated from Adamawa. He said, “We have 132 Almajirai, which is one-third of the 400 street kids (Almajirai) from Gombe. We have security to accompany them alongside a guide. We have spoken with the Gombe State Government and they are ready to receive them.” Copyright PUNCH.
