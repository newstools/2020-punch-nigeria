Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja Hawkers of face masks stormed the Federal Secretariat complex in Abuja on Monday as workers returned to their offices following the partial lifting of the lockdown by the Federal Government to curb the spread of the COVID -19 pandemic. Our correspondent, who moved round the secretariat, saw many of the hawkers brandishing different designs of the face masks. The hawkers positioned themselves at strategic locations, particularly at entry points to the various ministries and establishments in the complex. They made frantic efforts to get the workers and other persons visiting the secretariat to purchase the products. However, our correspondent also observed that nearly everybody at the secretariat wore face masks. But some people also bought additional face masks from the hawkers. The colourfully designed face masks cost between N200 and N500. Apart from the Federal Secretariat, several face mask hawkers were also seen at traffic lights, junctions and ‎around other public places, including major supermarkets, in Abuja. Our correspondent also observed that many workers turned up for work at the secretariat on Monday. Checks at ministries of Science and Technology, Communications and Digital Economy, and others showed that most officers on Grade Level 14 and above turned up at their offices. It was the same situation at some other ministries which are not located ‎within the federal secretariat. Such ministries, including Mines and Steel Development, Finance, Budget and National Planning, and others also recorded high turn-out of workers on Monday.
