Johnny Edward Super Eagles forward, Moses Simon, has been voted Nantes’ player of the season after his outstanding performances for the Canary this season, The PUNCH reports. The Nigerian joined the French side on loan from Spanish La Liga side, Levante, in the summer, scoring nine goals and providing eight assists in 30 games in all competitions, before the Ligue 1 season was cancelled due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the club’s website, Simon recorded 40 per cent of the votes casted by 3,500 voters. “Moses Simon left a lasting impression at the club. He has been voted Canary of the 2019-2020 season,”  the club’s website stated. The 24-year-old is Nantes joint-top scorer in the league alongside Ludovic Blas, who also bagged nine goals, but the Nigerian edged his teammate with his number of assists: five. It remains to be seen if Nantes will take up the option to sign Simon on a permanent basis after a successful loan spell. Simon, who has won 30 international caps for Nigeria, previously played for AS Trencin in Slovakia and KAA Gent in Belgium. Copyright PUNCH.
