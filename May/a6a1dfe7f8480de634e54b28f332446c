A non-governmental organisation, After My Heart Global Foundation Inc, Nigeria, has admonished Nigerians against the stigmatisation of discharged coronavirus patients. The Administrative Head of the NGO in Nigeria, Mrs Erhumwunsee Osaretin, made the plea while giving out face masks to residents of Aiyetoro-Makun community in Sagamu, Ogun State. She told the beneficiaries that the face masks were not a fashion item to be kept in pockets or handbags but to be worn every time when in public to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The National Director of the NGO, Mr Akhigbe Adodo, while responding to some of the residents who requested money rather than face masks, reminded them that health was more important than money. He advised the residents to observe regular hand-washing, social distancing and other measures to prevent COVID-19 spread. In his remarks, the Chairman, Parents/Teachers Association, Saint Paulâ€™s Anglican School, Aiyetoro-Makun, Sagamu, where the event held, Mr Sodimu Olasukunmi, said since the lockdown started, the NGO was the only organisation that had brought items to the community. He called on the federal and state government to remember them in these trying times.
