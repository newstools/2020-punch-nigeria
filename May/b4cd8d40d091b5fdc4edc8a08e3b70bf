BOLA BAMIGBOLA Osun State Chief Judge, Oyebola Ojo, has freed 26 awaiting trial inmates from Ilesa and Ile-Ife medium security custodial centres. The Public Relations Officer, Nigerian Correctional Service, Osun State Command, Olusola Adeotan, in a statement on Friday, said the inmates were freed during visits by the chief judge and her team to the custodial centres. The statement explained that the gesture was meant to decongest custodial centres to prevent spread of coronavirus. It further said that 14 of the inmates were released from Ile-Ife, while 12 others were set free from Ilesha Custodial Centre. “They were released during the chief judge’s special visit to the custodial centres which started from Ilesa Custodial Centre on Wednesday, May 27, and ended at Ile-Ife Custodial Centre, on Thursday, May 28, 2020,” the statement read. In his welcome address, the Controller of Corrections, Osun State Command, Segun Oluwasemire, stated the resolve of the officers and men of the command to discharge their mandates of “reformation, rehabilitation and reintegration of the Nigerian Correctional Service.” Oluwasemire charged the freed inmates to be of good behaviour and put to good use vocational training and knowledge acquired while in custody. In separate remarks, officers in charge of Ilesa and Ile-Ife custodial centres, Johnbull Saudje and Babatunde Ajani, urged the chief judge to visit the centres on a quarterly basis to ensure quick dispensation of justice.
