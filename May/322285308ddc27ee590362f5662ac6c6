Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Friday handed over a property forfeited by former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Allison-Madueke, to the Lagos State government for use as an isolation centre for COVID-19 patients. The property consisting of six flats of three bedrooms and a boys’ quarter was forfeited by Allison-Madueke following an order of the Federal High Court in 2017. Speaking during the handover ceremony, the Lagos Zonal Head of the EFCC, Mohammed Rabo stated that the gesture was part of the commission’s social responsibility efforts against the spread of coronavirus. He said, “In addition to our mandate to fight economic and financial crimes, the commission is committed and ready to render essential services that may be required of it in the fight against COVID-19. “Therefore, Lagos State should not hesitate to call on the commission anytime the need for such an essential service arises.” A statement by the EFCC spokesman, Dele Oyewale, said the Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, thanked the anti-graft agency for the gesture, noting that it was a welcome collaboration between the federal and the state government.
