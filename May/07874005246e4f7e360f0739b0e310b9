Sola Shittu, Benin Senators representing Edo State at the National Assembly on Monday donated two trailer loads of food items to support the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic in the state. The senators are: Matthew Urhoghide, (PDP, Edo South), Clifford Ordia (PDP, Edo Central), and Francis Alimekhena (APC, Edo North). The relief materials donated to the state government include rice, beans and Indomie noodles, which will serve as palliatives to cushion the adverse economic effects of the pandemic in the state. Receiving the items, Governor Godwin Obaseki said, “This support is uplifting because sometime last week, some people started playing politics with the situation on ground instead of collaborating with the state government to fight the scourge. “We are doing a lot in the area of healthcare, as we have trained 4,200 healthcare workers to help in the fight against the COVID-19. We are doing massive screening and in our first week we screened over 54,000 persons and the target for us is to screen 100,000 this week. “Out of these, we intend to test and collect a minimum of 100 samples each day and the goal is to screen 500,000 residents in the state and test a minimum of 5,000 samples. This will help us understand the spread of the virus and how best to stop it.” Senator Urhoghide, who spoke on behalf of the senators said, “It is wise to collaborate and support the government noticing the determination and purposeful leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki in curtailing the spread of the disease. “At the federal level, the 109 senators have donated 50 per cent of our salaries to support the Federal Government to face the challenges.” Copyright PUNCH.
