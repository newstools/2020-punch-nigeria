Sola Shittu, Benin The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Edo State Chapter, on Friday, demanded the reopening of churches in the state, noting such move would assist government efforts in a number of ways. In a communique issued at the end of its executive committee meeting, the PFN said the pulpit would increase the creation of awareness on the preventive measures to curb the spread of the pandemic. The resolution read in part, “PFN is not unaware of the efforts of the state Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, and the efforts of churches to be closed for two weeks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria and in Edo State. “The markets are allowed to run, and the populace is also allowed to move about to a reasonable extent which is commendable. “PFN, therefore, demands that churches should be allowed to be reopened with full compliance with the extant guidelines.” The communique jointly signed by the state PFN chairman, Bishop Mon Igbonisa, and the Secretary, Revd. Solomon Udi took objection to the harassment of pastors and Christians who attend church services while demanding the cessation of such treatment.
