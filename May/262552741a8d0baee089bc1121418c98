John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party on Tuesday asked the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to restore policemen attached to the Rivers State Task Force on COVID-19 pandemic. The party said the withdrawal of policemenÂ  from the state task force amounted to playing politics with efforts being made to check the spread of COVID-19 across Nigeria. This was contained in a statement signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja. According to the party, the withdrawal of the police personnel from the team will only lead to lawlessness as well as frustrate the genuine efforts of the Rivers State Government to ensure compliance to health safety protocols put in place to check the spread of COVID-19 and safeguard the lives of Nigerians in the state.
