GBENGA ODOGUN Bandits have killed at least three persons and nine cows in Egume, Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State. Speaking with journalists in Lokoja, the state capital, on Saturday, the Assistant Secretary of the state chapter, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, Mallam Ademu Abubakar, said the incident occurred on Thursday at about 8am. He said some gunmen invaded the Fulani community at Ofanwa Elubi in Egume and shot at some of the residents, killing three persons and nine cows. Abubakar said many people were injured in the invasion which lasted several minutes. He said, “This was another attack on our innocent members who were killed in cold blood on May 14, 2020. The repeated killings of our people in Igalaland is becoming unbearable. “This time round, they launched the attack on our camp. They started shooting at them without any offence at all. Those killed during the attack include Tine Idris, Fatu Idris and Abdulkareem Saleh.” Abubakar said the incident was reported to the Divisional Police Officer at the Egume Police Station. He said the DPO quickly mobilised his men to the scene, adding that bodies of the victims had been deposited at the mortuary. Confirming the attack, the spokesperson for the state police command, William Ayah, said the commissioner of police deployed some policemen in the area to avoid further attacks. He added that the command had already launched a manhunt for the killers. Copyright PUNCH.
