Patrick Odey, Uyo The Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly has suspended the Chairman of Nsit Atai Local Government, Emem Ibanga, and her counterpart in Uyo, Imo Okon. The duo were suspended indefinitely over alleged gross misconduct and administrative inefficiency. Subsequently, the House mandated their Vice Chairmen, Mr Idorenyin Effiong Inyang, and Ukai Udeme Emmanuel respectively, to immediately take over. This followed a resolution of the House read by the Speaker, Aniekan Bassey, after the consideration of a report by the chairman of its committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Public Petitions, Victor Ekwere, and that of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mark Esset. Bassey said the resolution was based on provisions of Section 81 (1) of the Local Government Administration Law (2017) as amended, which says “Where the peaceful functioning of the Local Government or its Council is hindered by protracted crisis, the House of Assembly may, by a resolution passed by a simple majority of all its members, impose such restrictive measures in the Local Government Area or its Council as the House of Assembly may deem fit.” Copyright PUNCH.
