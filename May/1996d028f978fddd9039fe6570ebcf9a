ALEXANDER OKERE The General Superintendent, Holy Spirit Mission, Lagos, Bishop Charles Ighele, has advised the Federal Government to seek a homegrown solution to the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the country. Nigeria has recorded a total of 68 deaths and 2,170 cases across the country as of 11pm on May 1, 2020, with state government announcing restriction of movement to curb the spread of the deadly virus. Ighele, who said the country was blessed with experts in the field of science and had what it takes to combat the novel disease, noted that the Federal Government had not performed poorly. He, however, stated that the fight against the pandemic needed to be raised beyond the way it was being handled, while urging Nigerians to cooperate with the federal and state health authorities and maintain proper hygiene. “We have to look for a homegrown solution. The defence against the virus is good but we have not attacked the disease the way we should. I’ve listened to experts on how the new virus can be handled.” “I’ve listened to the Director-General of National Food and Drug Administration and Control, Prof Mojisola Adeyeye. I’ve heard of India banning export of Chloroquine to other countries. What is Nigeria doing to discover a cure for this particular virus? “I would have wanted the President to look inward. We shouldn’t totally depend on other people. I believe that there is a solution here. We cannot compare our social life with the United States or Europe which are more advanced than us in virtually everything,” he explained. Copyright PUNCH.
