Ricky Hatton is convinced Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury will go toe-to-toe in the ring, insisting ‘‘there’s no way it cannot happen’’. The British pair hold all the heavyweight belts between them, with each man desperate to unify the division. Joshua is scheduled to fight Kubrat Pulev next, while Fury takes on Deontay Wilder for a third time, but both fighters are desperate for their opponents to step aside in order to get the all-British clash underway. With the coronavirus crisis delaying both bouts, talks have begun between Fury and Joshua’s promotion teams in an attempt to deliver the fight. And Hatton, who held titles at welterweight and light-welterweight, believes it’s inevitable that the fight will be made. ‘‘I have been a fan of the game and a fan of British fighters past and the present,’’ Hatton told TalkSport. ‘‘I remember years ago we would have two British lads competing for the title – but I had never heard of them. ‘Now we have two of the best with different styles and different personalities. ‘There’s no way it cannot happen.’’
