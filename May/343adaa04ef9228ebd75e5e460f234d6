Ebenezer Bajela President, African Chess Confederation, Lewis Ncube, has lamented the inability of the African body to attend the 2020 African Individual Chess Championships scheduled for Lagos, due to the coronavirus pandemic, adding that the event may be postponed to next year. The annual event was earlier scheduled to take place between May 20 and 31 in Lagos. The winner of the Open Section and the Women’s Section, aside from winning $5,000 and $3000 will be awarded the FIDE titles of International Grand Master and Woman International Grand Master respectively. Ncube told Sunday PUNCH, “We were looking forward to coming over to Nigeria for the 2020 African Individual Chess Championships. “Unfortunately, the COVID-19 outbreak disrupted it and no new date has been fixed. It is unlikely the event will take place this year. We shall review the situation when the COVID-19 situation is over.” It would be the first time, since 2010, that the annual event won’t take place, if it’s moved to next year. The last edition of the African Chess Championships was held in Hammamet, Tunisia in 2019, with Egyptian duo Bassem Amin and Shahenda Wafa emerging winners in the male and female categories respectively.
