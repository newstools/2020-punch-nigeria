Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State Police Command, on Wednesday, arraigned a 35-year-old man, Michael Abiodun, before an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court for assaulting a policewoman enforcing the lockdown order in the state. Abiodun was charged with a count of assault. The police prosecutor, Inspector Johnson Okunade, told the court that the defendant assaulted Inspector Oluremi Isah, who is attached to the Ologede Divisional Police Headquarters in Ado-Ekiti. Okunade said the defendant committed the offence on May 1, 2020, around 6pm. He stated that the policewoman told the defendant to be in a queue on the road, but Abiodun refused to heed the advice, which led to an argument, and in the process, he allegedly slapped the officer. Okunade stated, “This happened while the policewoman was performing her lawful duty of enforcing the lockdown order by the state government. “The offence contravenes Section 356 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012.” The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge. The prosecutor urged the court to adjourn the case to enable him study the file and assemble his witnesses. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Olanike Adegoke, adjourned the case till May 13, 2020, for mention. Copyright PUNCH.
