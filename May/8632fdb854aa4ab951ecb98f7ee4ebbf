The Chief Executive officer of SMO Foods and Fruit Nigeria Limited, Mr Shuiab Mubarak, has recommended a huge investment in agriculture as a way to rebound the Nigerian economy from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, Mubarak claimed that agriculture remained the only sector that was yet to be affected by the pandemic. He said, “The coronavirus outbreak has made farming and another agro sector now growing more than ever before and the need for food is increasing daily. “The prices of products and other staples are getting higher every day, as there is no more room for the importation of food materials, Nigeria and indeed the world is depending on what is produced locally.” The SMO boss also advised investors to invest in agriculture, saying it yields huge profits. Shuiab advised investors to “join Smo food and fruit Nigeria limited to enjoy farming and build wealth in agriculture. “We have farm input capable of a huge return of investment like seedlings (dwarf hybrid Fruiting tree) e.g orange, mango, cashew, lemon, strawberries, apple, soursop, lime, permanganate and lots more that all fruit in a year, they are dynamic in produce, as they can also be planted on the ground or in the flower pot at home for home use. “These seedlings are best for commercialization because they have big and many fruits per harvest and can mostly fruit all year round.”
