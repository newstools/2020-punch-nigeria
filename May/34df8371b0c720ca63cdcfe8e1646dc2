Tony Okafor, Awka A commercial bus, on Tuesday, killed a man, who was said to have gone to buy anti-malaria drugs from a nearby chemist store to treat himself. The deceased, identified as Sylvester Ezeoke, was said to be riding his motorcycle when he was crushed to death. The incident happened on the Ekwulobia/Umunze Road, Nawfija, in the Orumba South Local Government Area of Anambra State. An eyewitness told our correspondent that the bus driver was on high speed when he knocked down the deceased. The eyewitness stated, “The man just stepped out to buy anti-malaria drugs. He complained of having malaria two days ago after returning from his farm. We were shocked to hear the sad news. It’s a rude shock. “It was learnt that the bus driver was rushing to Ekwulobia from Umunze to take turns.” The Public Relations Officer, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps in the state, Edwin Okadigbo, confirmed the incident to our correspondent. He said the corpse of the victim had been deposited in the Orumba General Hospital, Nawfija. “The Orumba South Divisional Officer, NSCDC, Innocent Offor, deployed officers in the scene of the accident,” Okadigbo said.
