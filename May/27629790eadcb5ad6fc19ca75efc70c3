Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has resolved to investigate the activities of the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company from 2015 to 2020. The probe is based on a motion moved by Mr Muhammed Wudil and 24 others at the plenary on Tuesday, entitled, ‘Need to Investigate Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company’s Activities from 2015 to Date.’ Moving the motion, Wudil noted that the House Committee on Power was saddled with the responsibility of carrying out oversight on the Ministry of Power and its agencies, including the NBET. He said the committee had received complaints against the company since its establishment. The lawmaker said the House was also aware that several anti-corruption agencies, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Independent Corrupt Practices (and Other Related Offences) Commission as well as the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation had earlier investigated the NBET and came out with reports. Adopting the motion, the House resolved to mandate its committees on power and financial crimes and anti-corruption to “investigate the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Company from 2015 to 2020 and report back within two weeks for further legislative action”.
