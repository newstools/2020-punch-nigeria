Kayode Oyero Lagos State Health Commissioner, Prof Akin Abayomi, says he is not infected with coronavirus. The commissioner had earlier on Thursday announced that 10 persons associated with the Lagos State Government House, Marina, tested positive for the virus. But he stated on Friday via Twitter that he did not test positive for the disease while urging the public to disregard false reports claiming otherwise. “I hereby implore the general public to disregard the fake and misleading news circulating in the media to the effect that I have tested positive for COVID-19 infection. “It is evident that the fake news is calculated at causing panic and unnecessary anxiety amongst the populace,” Abayomi wrote while urging Lagosians to remain vigilant and continue to play their role by wearing masks in public places, avoiding crowd as well as observing good hygiene and social distancing in order to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in the state. Meanwhile, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control on Thursday night announced three-digit cases in the state, the highest in a day for any state in Nigeria. The Centre said 183 new infections were reported in Lagos, bringing the total cases to 1491 including 406 recoveries and 33 fatalities.
