RAPHAEL EDE Gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen on Saturday kidnapped a woman, Mrs Muna Ezeudu, popularly called ‘Mama Enugu’ by locals. A relation of Ezeudu, Mrs Nwanneka Agbo, told Sunday PUNCH that Ezeudu was kidnapped at her residence in Eziam Nike, Enugu East Local Government Area of the state in the early hours of Saturday. Agbo claimed that the kidnappers were Fulani herdsmen. She said, “My sister sent us a text message that read, ‘Herdsmen kidnapped us and kept us at Eziam Nike Forest Hills.’” Our correspondent learnt that Ezeudu’s abduction happened barely a week after another woman, one Mrs Eneh from Eziam Nike community, was kidnapped and released after parting with some money as a ransom. A security source said Eziam Nike had become a hotbed of kidnapping in the state recently. “The Abakpa Divisional Police Officer, SP Azubuike Fred, led a squad to track the kidnappers at their hideout,” the source said. Efforts to get the reaction of the state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Daniel Ndukwe, failed as he neither picked calls nor replied to the text message sent to his phone. Copyright PUNCH.
