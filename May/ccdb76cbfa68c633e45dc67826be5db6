Kayode Oyero The United States says it will compile and evaluate information obtained from witnesses in the killing of a black man, George Floyd. In a joint statement on Thursday, the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Minneapolis Field Office said they were conducting a “robust criminal investigation” into the circumstances surrounding Floyd’s killing on May 25. “The Department of Justice asks for cooperation from all witnesses who believe they have relevant information and urges calm as investigators methodically continue to gather facts.

If it is determined that there has been a violation of federal law, criminal charges will be sought,” the statement read in part while urging anyone with further evidence to get in touch. US President Donald Trump had ordered an investigation into the killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, who died after Minneapolis police arrested him on Monday on suspicion of using a counterfeit banknote. Police handcuffed him and held him to the ground, with a bystander video showing an officer pressing his knee on Floyd’s neck. The videos showed Floyd saying that he couldn’t breathe until he went silent and limp. He was later declared dead. Hundreds of people had begun marching in Minneapolis for days – many wear masks as protection against the novel coronavirus. Protesters on Thursday set a police station in Minnesota ablaze in a third day of demonstrations as the city seethed over Floyd’s killing.
