Maiharaji Altine A lecturer with the Federal University Gusau, Zamfara State, Sadiya Talata-Mafara, has reportedly been abducted by suspected gunmen. Talata-Mafara, who is a nursing mother, was abducted in her residence at Samaru, Gusau. A family member who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity said the kidnappers initially demanded N10m as ransom before the lecturer could be released. A family source told Sunday PUNCH that they offered to pay N2m to the kidnappers but the money was rejected. “The kidnappers insisted that they would not accept anything below N10m. They are demanding N10m and we offered them N2m which they rejected,” said the source. The source, however, said the family negotiated the ransom to N5m, which the kidnappers had agreed to. “But we are struggling to get the money for the lecturer’s release. The kidnappers made her abandon her little daughter at home,” the source said. Speaking to our correspondent on the issue, the spokesperson for the Federal University Gusau, Mallam Umar Usman, said the school authorities were sad over the incident. He added that the university was looking for ways to ensure the release of the lecturer. Efforts to speak with the state police spokesperson, Mohammed Shehu, were unsuccessful as his mobile indicated that it was switched off. Copyright PUNCH.
