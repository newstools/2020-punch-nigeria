Bola Bamigbola A non-governmental organisation, Success Ogunkolade Foundation, has distributed 1,200 litres of Premium Motor Spirit to 300 residents of Ijebu-Jesa, Osun State, to cushion the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Beneficiaries were each given four litres of petrol at a designated filling station. The Chief Executive Officer of the foundation, Success Ogunkolade, who inaugurated the exercise on Friday, said the initiative was aimed at cushioning the effects of coronavirus pandemic on the residents. In a related development, the staff of the Federal Polytechnic, Ede, Osun State, have donated food items to residents in their host community as palliatives to cushion the effects of the  pandemic. This was contained in a statement signed by the insitution’s Public Relations Officer, Sola Lawal, on Friday. He said the food items worth over N1m were given to beneficiaries who were mostly elderly men and women as well as daily income earners. Coordinator of the group, Dr Samson Oluga, was quoted by the statement as saying, “We have realised that the lockdown imposed by the government to curb the spread of coronavirus has brought negative effects on the people, especially the daily income earners. “Many of them cannot afford a good meal for themselves and members of their families because they don’t have any other means of livelihood, if they don’t go out to work daily.” Copyright PUNCH.
