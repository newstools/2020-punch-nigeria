Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission says it is ready to commence the retrial of former Governor Orji Kalu immediately. The EFCC said this in a statement by its Spokesman, Dele Oyewale, on Friday, while reacting to a judgment by the Supreme Court. The apex court had upturned Kalu’s conviction and ordered a fresh trial, adding that the trial judge, Justice Mohammed Idris, was not competent to hear Kanu’s case since he had been elevated to the Court of Appeal. The statement read in part, “The apex court based its verdict on the grounds that Justice Mohammed Idris, who convicted Kalu and others had been elevated to the Court of Appeal before the judgment and returned to the lower court to deliver the judgment which it considered as illegal.

It is a technical ambush against the trial of the former governor.  The commission is prepared for a fresh and immediate trial of the case because its evidences against Kalu and others are overwhelming. “The corruption charges against Kalu still subsist because the Supreme Court did not acquit him of them. The entire prosecutorial machinery of the EFCC would be launched in a fresh trial where justice is bound to be served in due course.”
