Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt A civil society organisation known as the Situation Room has disagreed with the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, over the directive on the total lockdown of Port Harcourt City and Obio/Akpor Local Government Areas of the state. The statement signed by the group’s convener, Vivian Bellonwu, the spokesman of the group, Karl Uchegbu, and three others indicated that leaving the street shops and corner markets open would address the people’s basic daily needs and also check the spread of coronavirus. Recall that the state governor, Nyesom Wike, on Monday ordered that the entire Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor LGAs should be completely locked down on Thursday, April 7, 2020, as further measures to check the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the group said, “We are concerned that instead of striving for consensus, government at all strata have continued to revel in anti-peoples’ policies and directives, without broad consultation with relevant stakeholders. This certainly is not the time government should be acting alone. “In a similar vein, in a bid to work out a workable and practical arrangement and solutions to the situation at hand, need to create some designated and moderated open spaces, where traders can modestly operate from, with security operatives attached to ensure healthy social distancing. “We wish to on behalf of the suffering people of the state, who are bearing the backbreaking brunt of this lockdown, especially appeal to the conscience of the State governor, Barr. Nyesom Wike, to please re-think and withdraw this harsh lockdown order in the overall interest of the suffering masses.”
