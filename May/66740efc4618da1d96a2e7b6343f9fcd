A senior council member, Kano Emirate Council, Prof. Isa Hashim, has died at the age of 86 years. Hashim, who is the Jarman Kano, died on Sunday after a brief illness in Kano. A family member of the deceased, Aliyu Ibrahim, said Hashim’s health condition had deteriorated in recent days. He added that the remains of Hashim had been buried in accordance with Islamic rites. Hashim, a professor of Political Science, was a senior lecturer with Bayero University, Kano where he taught for many years before his retirement. Hashim’s death came barely 24 hours after the death of Emir of Rano, Alhaji Abubakar Tafida. Tafida and many other prominent sons of the state including academics, industrialists, bankers, activists, journalists, community, and religious leaders lost their lives in recent weeks. (NAN)
