Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government’s Joint Technical Task Team for Emergency Response on the ease of movement of livestock, food stuff and agricultural inputs has charged security personnel to thoroughly screen vehicles conveying agricultural products. Chairman of the team, an Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Austin Agbonlahor, gave the charge on Thursday when members of the team visited major checkpoints along the Abuja-Kaduna and Abuja-Keffi dual carriageways in the North-Central geopolitical zone. Agbonlahor told security operatives stationed on various roads that movement of persons, illegal arms, ammunition and illicit drugs must not be allowed. The team stopped at Tarfa in Kaduna, Sabon Wuse in Niger, as well as Keffi, Nasarawa State for on-the-spot compliance assessment. The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development disclosed this in a statement issued in Abuja and stated that Agbonlahor lauded the compliance by security personnel with the directive issued by the President during his nationwide broadcast. The ministry said the directive was further facilitated by the task team to ensure strict compliance to avoid food scarcity across the country. The FMARD said, “The AIG, while commending the officers on duty, admonished them to ensure proper screening of the vehicles conveying agricultural products.” Copyright PUNCH.
