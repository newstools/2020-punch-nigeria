Johnson Okafor Shareholders of Access Bank Plc on Thursday at the 31st annual general meeting held in Lagos commended the Board of Directors, management and staff of the bank for the performance for the 2019 financial year. The shareholders also approved 65 kobo dividend per share proposed by the directors of the bank. The meeting, which was held by proxy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had three leaders of various shareholders’ association present. Sir Sunny Nwosu of Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria, Mr Owolabi Peters of Integrated Shareholders Association of Nigeria and Mrs Bisi Bakare of Pragmatic Shareholders Association of Nigeria said despite the challenging operating environment, Access Bank did not only record improved results, but also rewarded shareholders with good dividend that was timely, given the difficulties created by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, Nwosu said Access Bank had good foresight by merging with the defunct Diamond Bank Plc, noting that “the professional and seamless manner with which the integration was done should be commended and shareholders appreciate the board and management.” On her part, Bakare said unlike some of its competitors, Access Bank recorded increased profits in the past three years, noting that shareholders had confidence in the board and management to continue to deliver improved performance. In his address, Group Managing Director/CEO, Access Bank Plc, Dr Herbert Wigwe, said the group delivered a 26 per cent increase in gross earnings of N666.8bn from N528.7bn in 2018, comprising interest income growth of 41 per cent from previous levels to N155.9bn despite declining interest rate environment.
