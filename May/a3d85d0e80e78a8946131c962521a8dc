’Femi Asu The Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board has advised companies handling training in the nation’s oil and gas industry to reposition themselves and redesign their modules so as to overcome the current challenges. The Executive Secretary, NCDMB, Mr Simbi Wabote, said oil and gas trainers in the country would be hard hit by the twin challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic and low oil price as most training programmes would no longer hold. Wabote said there would be delayed learning interventions, loss of businesses, revenue and jobs. He spoke during in a webinar organised by the Oil and Gas Trainers Association of Nigeria, according to a statement. Wabote said most training programmes would likely take place in virtual classrooms and required virtual machines, simulators and dongles. He added that such training would demand high cost of set-up, but the operational cost would be lower over time and learning costs would become cheaper. He, however, said virtual learning models might lead to lower assimilation by the trainees and reduced profits for the companies at the onset. According to Wabote, the prevailing circumstances will lead to stoppage and cancellation of training programmes, delay in payments, reduction in the number or trainees and higher cost of administering programmes. He said there might be “abandonment of physical classrooms despite huge investments already made, need for new capitalisation to acquire infrastructure, absence of high speed internet and need for retraining of faculties.” He also warned there would be shortage of training opportunities because of lack of new projects in the industry and the crash in oil price.
