Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The National Youth Service Corps has sanctioned 28 corpers amongst the 2019 Batch B Stream 1 deployed to Ogun State with an extension and remobilisation of service. NYSC Coordinator in the state, Belinda Faniyi, disclosed this on Thursday, during a low-key passing-out event in Abeokuta, the state capital. Faniyi said 4250 corpers have been discharged after observing their one-year obligatory national service in the state. She said, “Some of the corps members definitely will have their service extended and some depending on the severity of their cases.

That is abscondment.” She noted that those amongst the discharged members who could not pick up their certificates could do so after the ban on interstate movement was lifted. “We have told them that those who cannot make it, after the COVID-19 pandemic they can always pick their certificates of national service,” she added.
