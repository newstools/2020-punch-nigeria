He tweeted, “Everyone who held and is holding any political office in Nigeria, whether elective or appointed, including me, has failed. “We sold crude oil for 64 years but we couldn’t feed our citizens for just two weeks of lockdown. Well, the God of the poor will judge us all. It’s time to reboot.”
