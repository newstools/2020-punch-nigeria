SUNDAY ABORISADE A former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has congratulated Muslims on the successful completion of this year’s Ramadan fast and urged them to sustain the good values they imbibed during the holy month. Saraki in a statement by his media aide, Yusuf Olaniyonu, on Saturday noted that the holy month taught the Muslim faithful piety, self-denial, good neighbourliness, discipline, empathyn and caring for the underprivileged in the society. He said if all the values were permanently sustained by Muslims, they would help to build a great country for the benefit of all. He urged Muslims to continue to pray for Nigeria and the entire world in view of the challenges posed by the raging COVID-19 pandemic, including its impending socioeconomic implications. He said, “This last Ramadan was very unique in that we observed it without all the normal gathering for Iftar, tarawih prayers, listening to tafsir and going for lesser hajj. “Also, as advised by both health and religious authorities, there will be no gathering for Eid prayers. “We all must, therefore, cooperate and work together to eliminate this pandemic and restore good health to our society.” “I enjoin all Nigerians to use this period of the Eid-el-Fitri to rededicate ourselves to our country, pray for good health and a stronger economy that can withstand the post-COVID-19 socioeconomic challenges.” Copyright PUNCH.
