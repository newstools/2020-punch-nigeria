Nike Popoola Governments of Nasarawa and Gombe have commissioned three new isolation centers fully equipped by the private sector-led Coalition Against COVID-19 to stem the tide of the scourge in the two states. A statement from CACOVID said Nasarawa State governor, Abdulahi Sule, received the equipment when he visited Shabu Isolation Centre, Lafia where individuals with cases of coronavirus were expected to be attended to. After inspecting some of the ventilators among other equipment already installed in some wards at the isolation centre, the governor assured that the gesture by CACOVID would go a long way in helping the state government meet its obligations in curbing the spread of the pandemic in Nasarawa State. Sule, commenting on the ventilators and other hospital equipment received from various philanthropists promised that all hands would be on deck to ensure the state intensified its awareness campaign against the virus. The statement said in Gombe, CACOVID renovated and supplied equipment to two general hospitals designated as isolation centers in the state. Another centre situated inside the General Hospital in Kaltungo LGA was furnished and equipped by CACOVID and was commissioned by the State Deputy Governor, Dr Manassah Jatau. Copyright PUNCH.
