Adeniyi Olugbemi, Sokoto The Sokoto State Executive Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party has been dissolved and its members asked to remain in their positions in acting capacities. The immediate past State Secretary of the party, Kabiru Aliyu, confirmed this development in an interview with our correspondent in Sokoto, on Tuesday. He explained that the decision was taken following the expiration of the tenure of the executive committee and the inability to conduct a congress to elect a new executive following the current COVID-19 induced nationwide lockdown. Kabiru said, “It is true that the state chapter of the party executive council has been dissolved by the national leadership of our party. “The problem is that the tenure of the sacked executive members expired over the weekend. “You will recall that we have conducted our ward congress before the issue of lockdown, which has affected almost everything in the country. “We decided to suspend the congress till after the lockdown and being a law-abiding party, our leaders follow the rules and regulations to dissolve the exco. “To avoid a vacuum, the immediate past executive, under the leadership of Ibrahim Milgoma, has been asked to take charge as the caretaker committee. “There is no difference between then and now; the leadership still remains but henceforth, it will be addressed as the caretaker committee.” Copyright PUNCH.
