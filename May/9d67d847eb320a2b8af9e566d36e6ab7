Kayode Oyero The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has said the lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic would produce “great things”. The 78-year-old cleric stated this on Sunday during a sermon broadcast live via the church’s media, DOVE TV. Adeboye, who traced lockdown to the era of biblical characters like Joseph, Elijah, David, John the beloved, and many others, said one of the “great things” that would come out of the lockdown is an increase in birthrate all over the world.

Let me advise those of you who are pastors – you are resting now; I am busy. Get ready because early next year, you’ll be having a lot of naming ceremonies. You’ll be going from house to house naming newborn babies as a result of the lockdown.” He noted that the rate of coronavirus recoveries across the globe is “amazing”, saying the percentage of discharged patients is less than one-tenth of the associated deaths recorded. “Aren’t you amazed at the number of those released compared to people who died? Check all over the world, you’ll find out that the number is less than those who have been healed. “If you do a scientific study, you’ll find out that the number of people who had died as a result of coronavirus is far less than those who died by accidents and other means,” he said.
