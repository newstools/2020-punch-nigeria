Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt There was palpable COVID-19 scare at the corporate headquarters of the Niger Delta Development Commission on Thursday in Port Harcourt after the death of the Executive Director, Administration and Finance, Chief Ibanga Etang. The NDDC management had after Etang’s death ordered the closure of its corporate headquarters in Port Harcourt for two weeks. NDDC also ordered the Director of Administration to ensure the fumigation and decontamination of the premises. The directive had raised the suspicion that the commission’s executive director could have died of coronavirus. The suspicion became heightened as the agency, in a memo signed by Silas Anyanwu on behalf of the Acting Managing Director of the NDDC, instructed staff members to embark on self-isolation for two weeks. The memo read, “I am directed to inform all staff that management has approved that the commission be shut down for two weeks from today, 28th May, 2020. “Consequently, all activities in the commission, including ongoing matters, are hereby shut down for the time being. “The head of security is by this memo directed to work our modalities to ensure the safety and security of the commission. While the Director, Administration, is requested to fumigate and decontaminate the entire offices and premises in the headquarters during the period.” Speaking with our correspondent, an insider in the NDDC said a group of special uniformed men had taken over the security of the premises of the agency. “The security guys came from Abuja. You know there are sensitive documents there and they must be secured, considering the fact that there is an ongoing forensic audit.” Copyright PUNCH.
