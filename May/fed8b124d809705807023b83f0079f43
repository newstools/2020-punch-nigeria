Patrick Odey, Uyo Akwa Ibom State Government has rejected ten vehicles donated by ExxonMobil to aid contact tracing of suspected COVID-19 patients in the state. The government had appreciated the company for the gesture made on Friday but in a statement issued on Sunday by its Information Commissioner, Charles Udoh, it described the vehicles as too old and incapable of withstanding the rigour of contact tracing. Udoh said the government’s decision followed an evaluation of the vehicles and other donations made by the company.

The commissioner, however, pointed out the government accepted the two ambulances and 20 hospital beds also donated by the oil company. He appreciated the continued support of corporate bodies and private individuals who have so far made cash or other material donations in the fight against COVID-19 in the state.
