Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu has said arrangement is been made to return to the prison, Adamu Adamu, a suspect in the murder of Mrs Funke Olakunrin, the daughter of Afenifere leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti. He noted that the murder suspect, who had earlier tested positive for COVID-19, has been certified negative after two consecutive tests in line with treatment and testing protocols. The governor made this known on Monday at the weekly COVID-19 press briefing held at the Government House, Akure, the state capital. Akeredolu stated that he had already made necessary contacts with the Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, to hasten the return of the defendant to the Correctional Centre since charges had been read in respect of the case. “It is no longer expedient to keep the suspect outside an approved Correctional Centre. Where he is, is not his proper place. We are already discussing with the Minister of Interior on the need to move the defendant to the Correctional Centre. That is where he rightly belongs. “We believe strongly that the minister will in no distance time, direct appropriate quarters within his jurisdiction to effect the transfer of the man to the appropriate place,” the governor said. The governor expressed assurance that the trial of the defendant would continue unhindered, after returning him to the correctional facility.
