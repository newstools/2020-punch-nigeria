Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Federal Capital Territory High Court reopened on Monday after six weeks of shutdown occasioned by lockdown and restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, but most of the 33 judges of the court were absent. The Chief Judge of the FCT judiciary, Justice Ishaq Bello, had in a new   COVID-19 Practice Direction which he issued on May 8, directed judges and magistrates to resume work on Monday with instruction that they ensured persons attending proceedings wear face masks and strictly observe other social distancing measures during sittings. As guide for compliance with social distancing measures prescribed by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Chief Judge directed judges and magistrates to limit their daily cases to five and number of persons present during proceedings to 10. While directing staff of the court to wash their hands with soap or use hand sanitisers, he also directed that hearing of some not-too-contentious cases could be determined in virtual proceedings on Zoom, Skype or any other approved video conferencing platforms. But our correspondent who visited the locations of the FCT courts in Maitama,  Apo, Wuse Zone 2, Jabi, and Gudu, observed that the Chief Judge’s directives were partially observed. Although the FCT judiciary had last week conducted a test run of its virtual proceedings, there was no indication of such remote hearing taking place on Monday. Regular sittings also did not hold in most of the courts visited. In Maitama for instance, only one judge resumed regular sitting with less than 10 lawyers and members of the audience in attendance.
