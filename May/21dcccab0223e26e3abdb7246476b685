John Ameh, Abuja The President, Major General  Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Wednesday, prayed for the quick recovery of the Emir of Daura, Umar Farouk-Umar. The Monarch was admitted at the Federal Medical Centre, Katsina State, amid fears of COVID-19 spread in Daura, though the cause of Farouk-Umar’s illness was not officially announced. This came as Governor Aminu Masari, shut the emir’s palace, saying that the decision was to prevent the spread of the infection. “No ulterior motive to the decision to quarantine the palace. “Palace is a place where people visit all the time; we take this decision to contain the spread of coronavirus. “Reports reaching me reveal that people in rural areas do not obey the order (on mass gathering); people gather during marriages, naming ceremonies, burials and other social gatherings. “I have directed the emirs of Katsina and Daura to deal decisively with anyone violating the order,” the governor stated while giving an update on COVID-19 containment in the state. Masari disclosed that the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control had already taken the samples of 89 people from the emir’s palace. In his message, Buhari said he received the news of the emir’s sudden illness with concern and expressed best wishes for the speedy recovery of the monarch. The President added, “I join the Daura Emirate and the entire people of Katsina State in praying for the recovery of our humble and dedicated emir, Alhaji Umar Farouk Umar.” Presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, said in a statement that Buhari was satisfied with the progress of his treatment so far.
