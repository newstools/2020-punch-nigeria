Former Barcelona and Cameroon star Samuel Eto’o insists he is the greatest African player to have ever played the game. El-Hadji Diouf recently made the bold claim that he was the greatest striker ever from the continent, while Didier Drogba’s name always gets mentioned when debating Africa’s greatest player of all time. However Eto’o has taken aim at both stars following Diouf’s comments, claiming there is ‘no debate’ whatsoever before insisting his will to be the best fired him to his illustrious career. “Even if my brother Diouf the last time, with an extra glass, got a little lost, there is no debate’, said Eto’o, via Goal. “None of them (Diouf and Drogba) can come and say that they were at my level or better. “And it’s not the fact that I say it, it’s a fact, it’s something that is there. I wanted to be number one and I have been throughout my career.” Eto’o – along with Yaya Toure – has claimed four African Player of the Year awards while Diouf and Drogba earned the accolade twice. During a career that started at Real Madrid and then took in the likes of Barcelona, Inter Milan, Chelsea and Everton, Eto’o amassed three Champions League titles, three La Liga crowns, two Copa del Reys, Serie A, the Coppa Italia twice and the FIFA Club World Cup. Eto’o also featured a massive 118 times for Cameroon, scoring 56 goals and playing at four World Cups. He also picked up Olympic gold in 2000 and clinched two African Cup of Nations titles. However, Diouf – who sparked the debate – won just one League Cup with Liverpool, and the Scottish Premiership and League Cup with Rangers.
