Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Bosede Taiwo, the woman abducted alongside the Ekiti State Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Folorunso Olabode, last Sunday evening has been freed. Taiwo and Olabode were in a car when they were abducted along the Isan-Iludun Road in Ekiti State, while a councillor for Ilejemeje area in the state who drove the car was shot dead by the bandits. The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Mr Sunday Abutu, told journalists in Ado Ekiti on Friday that the woman was freed on Thursday night by the abductors. “She was released inside one forest somewhere in Kwara State and she was said to have found her way to the main road, where she was helped,” he said. Meanwhile, a relative of the commissioner said the abductors initially demanded N30m ransom but reduced it to N15m on Wednesday. However, the police spokesperson said they were not aware of the demand. “As of now, the commissioner is still with the kidnappers while the police and other security agencies are doing their best to bring him home safe and sound,” Abutu said.
