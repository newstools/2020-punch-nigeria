’Tosin Oluwalowo Lille have received an €85m bid for Nigerian striker, Victor Osimhen, according to Telefoot. According to the report, the unnamed club is interested in securing the services of Osimhen in the summer. The Super Eagles forward has been the subject of interest of clubs, especially in the English Premier League. The clubs include Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal. Osimhen has been in great form since joining Lille from Belgian side Sporting Charleroi last summer and scored18 goals in 38 games. Lille President,  Gerard Lopez, had earlier in the year spoken about how hard it might be for the club to keep the Nigeria international. “Osimhen will be in Lille next season. Afterwards, there are factors I cannot control, such as the fact that a club comes and offers a salary that is six or eight times more than we can offer. “But I think it is sometimes better not to take a high salary and wait for the next season,” Lopez told French media.” Copyright PUNCH.
