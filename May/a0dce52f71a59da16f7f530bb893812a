Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Two workers of the Federal Polytechnic, Ado Ekiti, have died of electrocution while carrying out their duties in the school. Sources said the incident occurred on Monday when the victims, the Works Department of the institution, attempted to fix a defective borehole on the campus. Although the identities of the victims could not be ascertained, sources said one of them was from Kogi State, while the other hailed from Ekiti State. “The deceased, while working on the borehole, had wanted to remove a galvanised pipe for repair when a fatal mistake occurred. The pipe accidentally came ion contact with an exposed electricity cable, followed by a spark and they were electrocuted on the spot,” a source said. The source added that although other supportive workers were affected by the incident, they were lucky to escape death and serious injuries. The institution’s Deputy Registrar, Information, Mr Adeyemi Adejolu, who confirmed the incident, said, “It is true that they got electrocuted while performing their duties. It was a sad incident that the polytechnic will regret for long.” Adejolu said the corpse of the victim from Kogi State had been taken to his hometown for burial, while the family of the other person had been contacted.
