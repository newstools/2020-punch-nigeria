Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Only environmental health officers certified and licensed by the Federal Government should be hired to decontaminate public places, the Minister of Environment, Muhammed Mahmood, declared on Thursday. Mahmood said the Federal Ministry of Environment had decontaminated hundreds of establishments across the country and advised private businesses to only hire environmental officers licensed by the government. Reacting to reports that the ministry was demanding payments from private businesses before decontaminating their outfits, the minister said such claims were untrue. Mahmood spoke in Abuja at the briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. He said, “The Federal Ministry of Environment has taken as part of its mandate to decontaminate establishments, governmental and non-governmental. And we have done hundreds. “What we said as part of our regulation is that any private business that wants to decontaminate (its premises) must hire a licensed environmental health officer.” On the role of the environmental health officers in the containment of COVID-19, Mahmood said the officials had been ensuring that all measures to halt the spread of the virus were adhered to.
