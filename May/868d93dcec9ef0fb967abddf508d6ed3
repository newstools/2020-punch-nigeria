Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja Rights group, Amnesty International, has called on the Nigeria Police Force to immediately release broadcast journalist, Rotimi Jolayemi, who has spent three weeks in custody for criticising the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed. Jolayemi, who anchors a Yoruba radio programme, ‘Bi aye se ri’ on Osun State Broadcasting Service and Radio Kwara, was on May 5, 2020, arrested by the police for reciting a poem which was critical of the minister. The PUNCH reports that Jolayemi’s wife, Dorcas, and his two brothers were arrested and spent over a week in police custody when they could not produce him. They were, however, released when the journalist turned himself in.
