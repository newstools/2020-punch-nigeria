Toni Ufoh Mohammed Sanusi, the General Secretary of the Nigeria Football Federation, has assured that the Glasshouse would be guided by FIFA’s conditions on palliatives. The NFF chief made this known in an interview on Brila.net monitored by our correspondent. FIFA had made available the sum of $500,000 for each member association from the yearly operational funds to them, as part of efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic. Sanusi said FIFA had always hammered on financial accountability by members, adding that the NFF was ready to abide by the terms under which the funds were made available to the NFF. Sanusi said, “FIFA has rules and regulations, whatever they give, they will tell you how exactly they want you to spend it. So, I will tell you that whatever they give will be spent in accordance with whatever guidelines they give. “We have also developed a system whereby even after they say do this, do that, by the time we finish, we also send it to them and say this is what we have done, is it in order for us to go ahead? “Once they give the go-ahead, we will do it. Be rest assured that once the money is received from them, we will use it for the purpose it is meant to serve.” Copyright PUNCH.
