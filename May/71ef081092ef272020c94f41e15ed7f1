Solape Lawal-Solarin Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Abiodun Baruwa, believes poor preparation and the obsession to play in Europe are responsible for the failure of Nigerian goalkeepers in Europe’s top leagues. The former Sturm Graz goalie, capped five times by Nigeria, said failure to learn the goalkeeping trade remained the undoing of the new generation of keepers. “I played about seven to eight seasons in the domestic league before moving abroad, same with Ike Shorunmu,” Baruwa told The PUNCH.

Goalkeeping is tough mentally and physically; you need years of experience to excel.” Copyright PUNCH.
