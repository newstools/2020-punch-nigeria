Kylian Mbappe is considering signing a new deal with PSG worth a staggering £600,000-per-week, according to reports. The France World Cup winner’s impressive displays for club and country in recent seasons has seen him linked with the biggest clubs in world football with Liverpool and Real Madrid mooted as potential transfers. However, it seems the Ligue 1 champions are desperate to keep hold of their star man and have offered him a whopping £600,0000 a week. Mbappe is ‘considering’ the offer according to French publication L’Equipe, via the Mirror, which would put him in the same pay bracket as team-mate Neymar. The news will come as a blow to both Liverpool and Madrid with the latter thought to be ready to break the bank for him this summer. Mbappe has scored 90 in 120 appearances for PSG since joining the French club from Monaco in 2017 and at 21 years of age, he is a player who will deliver trophies wherever he goes. The Frenchman’s current contract runs until 2022 but PSG will be keen to get him tied down to a new deal to stop any suitors attempting to poach him this summer.
