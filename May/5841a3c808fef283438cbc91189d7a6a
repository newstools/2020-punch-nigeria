Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A Lagos-based medical doctor, who came into Osun State on Saturday to be with his family, has tested positive to coronavirus. A statement on Monday by the state Commissioner for Health, Dr Rafiu Isamotu, also disclosed that on arrival in the state, the said doctor checked into our Isolation Centre at Asubiaro, Osogbo. The statement read, “The state yesterday recorded another case of the COVID-19. He is a medical doctor based in Lagos who came into the state on Saturday to be with his family and suspected he was having the virus on arrival and checked into our isolation Centre at Asubiaro rather than going home. “His sample was collected and sent for testing. His result came out on Sunday and turned positive. “We are glad that he didn’t have contact with anyone but took the initiative to check himself into our isolation centre immediately he arrived in Osun. That way, the virus was contained,” Isamotu said. On the measures to contain the virus in the state, Isamotu urged the residents to adhere strictly to the dusk-to-dawn curfew on Monday to Thursday and the total lockdown on Friday to Sunday. He also appealed to residents not to receive visitors, especially those coming from outside the state, saying receiving such visitors might put their lives in danger. “The cases recorded in the state recently were of those who came into the state and I want to appeal to our people to stop encouraging their relatives or friends to return to Osun as this might endanger the lives of our people,” he added.
