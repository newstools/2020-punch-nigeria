Bola Bamigbola The embattled chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State, Soji Adagunodo, has rejected his suspension by the National Working Committee of the party. Adagunodo said the NWC of the party had not officially informed him of the decision and urged PDP members to ignore the letter circulating in the social media conveying his purported suspension. A letter dated April 30, 2020, signed by the PDP National Secretary, Umaru Tsauri, had directed Adagunodo to step aside and hand over the affairs of the party to his deputy. In his first reaction to the letter, Adagunodo called on PDP members to remain calm, describing the directive of the NWC suspending him as injustice. However, Adagunodo in another statement obtained on Saturday placed security agencies in the state on notice to act promptly against any forceful attempt to take over the state secretariat of the party to avoid the breakdown of law and order. He said, “Up till now, nobody has been appointed as acting chairman officially; if any, let the person make available the original copy of his letter of appointment upon which he intends to assume office. “The PDP members in Osun State are hereby advised to ignore the purported letter in circulation as no official communication from national headquarters had reached me. Members of the public are also advised to disregard any purported letter asking me to step aside.” The Osun PDP Deputy Chairman, Sunday Atidade, had already complied with the directive of the NWC of the party appointing him as acting chairman.
