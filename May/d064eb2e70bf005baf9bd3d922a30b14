The German women’s championship will resume behind closed doors on May 29, the country’s football federation announced Wednesday, after a suspension of almost three months due to the coronavirus. The men’s season resumed last weekend, also without fans and under strict health measures designed to minimise the threat from the virus. “I am very happy that the Bundesliga’s women’s clubs have come out in favour of the continuation of the season,” said DFB president Fritz Keller.
