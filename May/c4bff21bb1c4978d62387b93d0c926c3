Johnny Edward Ex-England international Peter Crouch’s dream of perhaps ‘representing’ Nigeria has been dashed after Gernot Rohr sealed a new deal with the three-time African champions on Wednesday. Crouch, 39, who scored 22 times in 42 appearances for England, joked on Twitter, “So excited to get my Nigerian passport through today #gosupereagles.” The retired footballer’s post further fuelled rumours that 73-year-old Englishman Harry Redknapp might be considered for the Eagles coaching job. Crouch played under Redknapp at Southampton, Portsmouth and Tottenham Hotspur. But Nigerian Football Federation president, Amaju Pinnick’s announcement that Franco-German Rohr had agreed to stay on as coach of the Eagles via Twitter few hours later put paid to any chances of Redknapp being handed the national team job. Fans joked on social media that Redknapp could bring along his favourite players like Crouch, Jermaine Defoe and Niko Kranjcar to Nigeria if he got the job. Larry Cole Odion tweeted, “Wow. So the Harry Redknapp’s rumour of being the Super Eagle’s coach is true. Wow.” “Issa (it’s a) joke. Harry is his former coach that always buys him wherever he coaches. So the coach is being linked with Nigeria’s coaching job,” Jeremiah Tam added. Matanza Pedro jokingly asked if Crouch was referring to the Crystal Palace job. “Are you being linked with the Eagles job at Selhurst Park?” “So excited for you mate, can’t wait to see Ahmed Musa hoof it upfield for you to punt it into the top bins,” Jacques Sparrow wrote.
