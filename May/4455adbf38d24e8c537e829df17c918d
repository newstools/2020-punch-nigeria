Gibson Achonu, Owerri A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress and former Secretary to the Government of Imo State, Chief Mark Uchendu, on Wednesday joined the race for the Imo North Senatorial district by-election. The seat became vacant after the death of the former occupant, Benjamin Uwajumogu. Uchendu, also a former member of the Imo State House of Assembly and a former commissioner described himself as the best man for the job considering his experience in public life. The aspirant said this while on a consultation tour in the zone during which he addressed the interim management committee chairman, ward chairmen, councilors and women leaders of the councils comprising Okigwe, Onuimo, Isiala Mbano, Ihitte/Uboma and Obowo council areas. He said, “The time has come for us to project our zone to an enviable height and if given the mandate, I will liaise with the relevant authorities to attract a university of science and technology in Okigwe while agricultural revolution, women and youth empowerment will enjoy a pride of place in our zone. “We want a situation where we can work with Governor Hope Uzodinma and project our zone. He is strongly connected with the NDDC and we will use him to attract dividends of democracy for our people. “There will be aggressive rural electrification, establishment of agro-industries and maximum utilisation of the Imo River for agricultural purposes and youth empowerment.” Copyright PUNCH.
