Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested three suspected fraudsters for hacking into the bank account of one Kolawole Sobande and stealing the sum of N300,000 from it. The suspects, Adebayo Oluwatosin, 23; Obinna Abiogbe, 27; and Segun Adefunmi, were arrested on Monday by operatives of the command. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. Oyeyemi said the suspects’ arrest followed information received from a Point of Sales operator, who alerted the police to the activities of the syndicate. The PPRO said the PoS operator told the police at the Sango Division that one of the suspects approached him to transfer the sum of N100,000 from an account to his own account and hand over the cash to him. Oyeyemi added, “But when the PoS operator demanded the suspect’s identity card, he discovered that it bore a different name to the one on the bank account. “Upon the information, the DPO, Sango Division, CSP Godwin Idehia, detailed his detectives to the scene, where the suspects were arrested.” Copyright PUNCH.
