Maiharaji Altine, Gusau The Zamfara State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party on Tuesday distanced itself from comments attributed to the state Commissioner for Rural Development and Cooperatives, Alhaji Abubakar Abdullahi. Abdullahi was quoted to have criticised the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), over his alleged poor handling of security issues in the state. In the said interview which he granted a national daily (not The Punch), the commissioner said, “Banditry has killed more than 3,000 people in Zamfara alone, yet the Federal Government pays more attention to COVID-19 that has killed less than 200 nationwide.” In his reaction, the state PDP secretary, Alhaji Hashimu Modomawa said, “The commissioner is a member of the APC and part of Governor Matawalle’s cabinet due to the all-inclusive nature of the government as initiated by the Governor to cater for all political opinion. “This privilege should not be abused rather should be seen as an avenue to bring peace and developments in the state.” “Such utterances by the commissioner are capable of undermining the objective of the all-inclusive government and set the State and Federal government on a collision course.” Copyright PUNCH.
