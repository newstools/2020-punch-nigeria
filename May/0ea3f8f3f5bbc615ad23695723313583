’Femi Asu Mobil Producing Nigeria, an ExxonMobil affiliate, has said it is donating 22 additional vehicles including two ambulances and medical supplies to various state governments and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control to assist in the country’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The oil major said in a statement that the Akwa Ibom State Government would receive two ambulances for emergency cases and 15 other vehicles, while Rivers State would receive five vehicles. It said medical supplies, including World Health Organisation-certified COVID-19 test kits, sample collection kits and hospital beds valued at more than N90m would be distributed to the NCDC as well as Akwa Ibom and Rivers states. The Chairman and Managing Director, ExxonMobil companies in Nigeria, Paul McGrath, said, “We are actively working with our partner, the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation and other stakeholders on ways to assist in halting the spread of the virus.” He said the NNPC/MPN Joint Venture’s efforts were being guided by government agencies’ advice with regard to specific requirements and determining the areas of greatest need. “Supporting Nigeria’s fight against COVID-19 requires a broad, collective effort that should follow the guidelines established by the NCDC as well as the state and federal governments,” he added. ExxonMobil’s donations are part of an oil and gas industry effort coordinated by the NNPC to provide medical supplies, deploy additional equipment and to support medical infrastructure and in-patient treatment, according to the statement.
