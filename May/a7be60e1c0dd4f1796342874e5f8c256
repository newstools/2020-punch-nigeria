Dangote Cement Plc said on Wednesday that it had donated 35 fully equipped security operational cars to the Lagos State Government. The cars were presented to the Lagos State Security Trust Fund by the firm’s Non-Executive Director, Mr Emmanuel Ikhazobor, who led the management to State House, Marina, according to a statement. Ikhazobor said the gesture was part of the firm’s Corporate Social Responsibility activities, which was done in appreciation of the efforts of the Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to make the state secure for the people and investments. He said the donation was in response to the challenges of securing the state as a destination of choice to investors, describing security as essential to economic development. Ikhazobor said, “We are presenting 35 saloon cars today to strengthen the operations of the Lagos State Security Trust Fund. “We commend the government of the state for instituting a trust fund with the mandate of utilising donations from corporate bodies and individuals to equip the security agencies operating within the state.” According to him, a major step towards encouraging investments and creation of employment is promoting and ensuring adequate security in our environments. Receiving the car keys, the Executive Secretary, LSSTF, Dr Abdulrrazak Balogun, described the donation as a huge intervention from a private sector organisation.
