Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The Central Bank of Nigeria has said that 10,000 Kogi State Government workers are to benefit from the approved N10bn Agribusiness Alternative Retirement Investment Scheme scheduled to take off soon. The consultant in charge of the scheme, Mr Joseph Idoko, who disclosed this while addressing newsmen on Monday in Lokoja, said the CBN had already approved the fund for the scheme. Idoko hinted that the programme, an offshoot of the CBN Anchor Borrowers Scheme, was specifically an indirect cluster farming investment for the workers, with oil palm and its value chain as mandate crop.
