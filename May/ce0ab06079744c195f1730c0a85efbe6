Nike Popoola Consumer Awareness and Financial Enlightenment Initiative has called on the Central Bank of Nigeria to mop up dirty notes in circulation to avoid further spread of coronavirus through currency exchange as the country battles to stop the virus in its track. CAFEi said in a statement that as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe with devastating effects, containing the virus had so far been one of the most effective options. The President, CAFEi, Otunba ‘Debola Osibogun, stated that recent reports indicated that coronavirus could survive on surfaces for as long as 72 hours, leading experts to believe it could be transmitted through currency exchange. She stated that this prompted organisations in other countries including China to begin disinfecting cash with ultraviolet heat treatment. Given the high rate of physical currency transactions in Nigeria, she stated that Nigeria had a higher vulnerability for the spread of the virus through this channel. Osibogun advocated that this move should be handled with the aggressive promotion of the cashless policy of the apex bank consistent with its policy of financial inclusion. “This two-pronged approach will ensure the spread of the virus is minimised in our day-to-day financial transactions and the use of alternative channels becomes an integral part of our existence,” she stated. She said, while government was emphasising good  hygiene and social distancing, it was important they also created more awareness about the need for people to disinfect their hands immediately after touching cash, cards, POS machines and the ATMs. Copyright PUNCH.
