Nike Popoola The Managing Director, Heritage Bank Plc, Ifie Sekibo, has urged the government and financial institutions to give priority attention to the empowerment of the Small and Medium Enterprises to accelerate the recovery of the nation’s economy. He said in a statement that the SMEs remained the bedrock of any vibrant economy and urged the players to continuously reinvent themselves, complement one another, dream big and possess cutting-edge ideas. Sekibo spoke at a webinar session on the theme, “Converting ideas into reality with focus on the SMEs” emphasising the need for small businesses to look inward, learn and possess the spirit of self-sacrifice. He advised that they must be bold and should not be afraid to fail because failing was not a failure. According to him, most entrepreneurs burning with ideas need to have mentors that will enable them to achieve their goals and sell the ideas. He stated, “Among the Small and Medium Enterprises in Nigeria, there has been too much of an individual focus, rather than a holistic or intergenerational focus. “There is not enough focus on partnership among Nigerian SMEs and this causes ventures to fail.” Commenting of the Heritage Bank’s philosophy, Sekibo said “One of our major cardinal points as a bank is supporting micro, small and medium-scale businesses and our strong desire is to see young men and women succeed in any area of their business. “This will help the society and the economy to grow, thereby moving the nation from poverty occasioned by COVID-19 to prosperous economy.” Copyright PUNCH.
