Kayode Oyero Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has asked the Federal Government to relax the 14-day total lockdown imposed on the state. The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had on Monday ordered a total lockdown in the state as part of measures to curb the spread of coronavirus disease. Buhari had also announced the deployment of a team of health experts to address the rising cases of “unusual deaths” in the state. Ganduje had immediately hailed the President’s decision, saying his increased focus on Kano would help the state tackle the pandemic. But speaking on Thursday at the Government House during the inauguration of a panel to support the Kano State Task Force Technical Committee, the governor highlighted that it was important to relax the lockdown so as to ease the hardship on residents of the state.
