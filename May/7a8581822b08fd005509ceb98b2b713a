The Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, an agency under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made this known via Twitter on Wednesday night. It said the Nigerian Embassy in Bangkok has been in touch with the three nationals who have been trapped at the airport since March due to airport closures occasioned by the pandemic.
