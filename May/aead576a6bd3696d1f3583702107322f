In the event of any challenge concerning this pandemic, the next port of call will be the Federal Government, so we cannot kick against its advice. We feel that the advice is genuine. If we took a decision and we have this kind of advice that is genuine and meant to support the health of our people, we have no reason whatsoever to go ahead with the decision we earlier took. “Therefore, on behalf of the State Executive Council, I hereby reverse the lifting of ban on churches and mosques services and prayers. “We have reverted to the status quo where churches, mosques, and other public places like markets were closed,” he said.
