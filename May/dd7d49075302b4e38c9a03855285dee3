Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has decried the attack on policemen during the enforcement of the lockdown order occasioned by the pandemic in the country. According to him, no fewer than 27 police officers had been assaulted while enforcing the federal government and state governments’ stay-at-home orders. He noted that some citizens had equally carried out attacks on police assets and facilities, adding that two police stations and police quarters were attacked and burnt down in Katsina and Abia States while 15 police vehicles and motorcycles were also damaged within the period. The IG in a statement in Abuja on Sunday, by the force spokesman, Frank Mba, warned that he would no longer condone the attacks on men and officers of the police. It said, “The IGP notes that since the commencement of the COVID-19 enforcement duties, a total of 27 police personnel have suffered series of attacks and assaults from members of the public at different times and locations. “Many of these officers are still in hospitals receiving treatment from the injuries sustained during such attacks.” Adamu said a female police officer, PC Ngozi Nkem, was injured in Agbor, Delta State when a police team was dispersing a group of persons holding a birthday party in clear disobedience to the social restrictions and distancing orders. The IGP enjoined the citizens to continue to cooperate with the police and other security personnel and voluntarily comply with all COVID-19 prevention orders.
