Olufemi Atoyebi, Abuja The Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, on Thursday, appealed to Nigerians to donate their buildings as isolation centres. Ehanire made the appeal at the press briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja. He said as the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control aimed to test two million people in the next three months more buildings would be needed as isolation centres. The minister stated, “I have appealed to citizens to make their property available temporarily for this purpose. I am sure that after that, there are many property owners who will come up and donate to state governments for a period of time to be used for this function.
