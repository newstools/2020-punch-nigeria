Anna Okon The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has said the state will be sustained by a robust agriculture-based economy in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. The governor said this during the inspection of ongoing construction work at the Edo State College of Agriculture, Iguoriakhi campus, in Ovia South West Local Government Area. According to him, the state government is focused on developing human capital in agriculture to groom and harness knowledge and skillset of its teeming youth population. A statement from the Edo State Government on Monday quoted him as saying, “Our focus is on creating an agriculture-based post COVID-19 economy. We can’t do that without skilled people to run the economy.” Obaseki added that his administration was redesigning the master plan of the College of Agriculture, devoid of politics, to serve the state’s economy.
