Ebenezer Bajela Former Real Betis star, Finidi George, has been named among the all-time African Best XI footballers in the Spanish La Liga. In a list compiled by SuperSport and posted along with a video on their Twitter handle, the former winger was the only Nigerian who made the cut in a selection largely dominated by the Cameroonians (4). Finidi joined the Andalusian club in 1996 from Dutch giants Ajax and was amazing in his first season, helping the side to fourth place on the log. The 49-year-old also helped the Spanish club reach the final of the Copa del Rey in his debut season but his goal was not enough to prevent them from a 3-2 extra-time defeat to Barcelona. Finidi scored an impressive 38 goals in 130 matches during his four-year spell with the Green and White before making a switch to Mallorca. Other top African stars on the list include Cameroonian goalkeeper Jacque Songo’o who played for Deportivo La Coruna, Lauren Etame Meyer (Cameroon/Mallorca), Noureddine Naybet (Morocco/Deportivo), Djene Dakonam (Togo/Getafe) and Alan Nyom (Cameroon/Getafe). Others are Yaya Toure (Ivory Coast/Barcelona), Seydou Keita (Mali/Barcelona), Samuel Eto’o (Cameroon/Barcelona), Benni McCarthy (South Africa/Celta Vigo) and Frederic Kanoute (Mali/Sevilla).
