Samson Folarin A former Deputy Clerk of the National Assembly, Chief Olayide Adelami, has been endorsed to run for the position of governor by the Akoko Progressives Forum, a group within the Ondo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress. The group said it was supporting the Owo-born politician as governorship candidate of the party because of his antecedent in public service. In a statement signed by its Coordinator, Ibitoye Olajide, and the General Secretary, Abiola Florence, the forum said, “Having looked into the antecedents of all aspirants, including the incumbent governor, the movement decided to support, canvas and vote for an aspirant with no bashed antecedent and who is interested in human development in the past years. The movement decided to pull her strength for the emergence of a candidate who has experience in dealing with the public. “Adelami was part of those that ensured the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari, during the last general elections. He was appointed by the presidency as the Coordinator, Presidential Support Committee, Ondo State.” In his reaction, Adelami said he remained a front runner in the Ondo State Governorship Election scheduled for October this year. The aspirant said he was not bothered by the adoption of a rival, Olusola Oke, as the consensus candidate of Unity Forum, another faction of the party. He said, “Let the people of Ondo State know that Chief Adelami will not be distracted by this purported endorsement (of Oke) and will therefore continue in his quest to liberate our people from the shackles of ineffective and inefficient governance of the current government.” Copyright PUNCH.
