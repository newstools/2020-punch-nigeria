A Pastor, Frankline Ndifor, 39, who laid his hands on dozens of confirmed and suspected coronavirus sufferers is dead, according to Dailymail.co.uk Dr Gaelle Nnanga, who was called to treat Ndifor after he started suffering severe respiratory difficulties a week after falling ill with the virus, said the pastor died ten minutes after treatment. Ndifor, a candidate in Cameroon’s presidential election in 2018, claimed to cure COVID-19. In previous weeks, sufferers had flocked to the Kingship International Ministries Church, founded by Ndifor, where he laid his hands on them and prayed for their healing. His supporters called him a ‘prophet’ and blocked the entrance to his home in the capital city of Douala for eight hours as medical workers tried to retrieve Ndifor’s body on Saturday morning. The Governor of the coastal region said a police force had to be deployed when supporters blocked the entrance to his home and claimed the pastor was on a spiritual retreat with God so he could not be buried. They sang and prayed for his resurrection throughout the weekend. He was buried in front of the house on the day of his death. Dozens of people knelt down on the ground outside Ndifor’s house in Cameroon as they prayed over the loss of a man who called himself a ‘prophet’. Ndifor also donated buckets and soap to people in need and his last public outing was on April 20, when he went out to distribute facemasks. Ndifor came seventh out of nine candidates in the 2018 presidential election with 23,687 votes. There have been 3,529 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 140 deaths so far in the central African state.
