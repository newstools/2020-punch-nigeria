Sodiq Oyeleke Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, has lost his father, Patrick.
The 21-year-old Lille forward announced the death of his father via his Twitter handle on Sunday. “RIP Dad. No words to describe this feeling,” he tweeted. The PUNCH gathered that Osimhen’s father died at age 80 in Lagos on Saturday night after a brief illness. Meanwhile, the Nigeria Football Federation has expressed grief and a groundswell of sorrow among the Nigerian Football family over the passing of the patriarch of the Osimhen family. President of the NFF, Mr. Amaju Pinnick, said, “I have spoken to Victor Osimhen and expressed the sorrow of the NFF and the entire Nigerian Football family. His club, Lille OSC of France have given him a private aircraft to come to Nigeria to be with his family and probably for the burial rites. We have applied for a landing permit but we are yet to get this. However, we are still on it and hopeful for the sake of the young lad. “The loss of either parent is usually a moment of heartbreak for anyone. We condole with Victor (Osimhen) at this moment and pray that God will grant his late father eternal rest, while also granting the family the fortitude to bear the great loss.” After helping Nigeria lift the 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Chile, Osimhen sealed a move to Bundesliga side Wolfsburg where he played 14 top-flight games in two seasons. He struggled to establish himself in the German city and thus, secured a move to Belgium, where he played the entire 2018/19 season and scored 12 goals in 25 league matches. Subsequently, he was signed by Lille as Nicolas Pepe’s replacement, who had moved to Arsenal in the off-season.
