Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federation Accounts Allocation Committee disbursed N1.95tn to the three tiers of government and other statutory agencies in the first quarter of 2020, the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative has said. NEITI in a report released on Monday said N791.4bn went to the Federal Government; N669bn was shared by the states and about N395bn was shared by the 774 local government areas. The balance went to the North-East Development Commission, the Excess Crude Account, the Federal Inland Revenue Service, the Nigeria Customs Service and the Department of Petroleum Resources. The NEITI report also noted that the Q1 2020 FAAC disbursement was the highest first quarter disbursements since 2014. “Total disbursements were N1.648tn in Q1 2015, N1.132tn in Q1 2016, N1.411tn in Q1 2017, N1.938tn in Q1 2018, and N1.929tn in Q1 2019,” the publication stated. The review examined FAAC disbursements in the first quarter of this year and made projections on the possible impacts of COVID-19 on government revenues. It said, “While total disbursements in Q1 2020 were slightly higher than Q1 2019 and Q1 2018, disbursements to the three tiers of government in Q1 2020 were slightly lower than Q1 2019 and Q1 2018. “This is due to transfers to other accounts in Q1 2020 which were not done in either Q1 2019 or Q1 2018. These include allocations to the North-East Development Commission and transfer to Excess Crude Account.” Copyright PUNCH.
