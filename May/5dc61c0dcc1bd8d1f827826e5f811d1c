Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The management of the Benin Electricity Distribution Company has said its branch manager in Abraka, Delta State, Mr Joshua Idoghor, was not detained by the police over the electrocution of one Ovie Obodo. PUNCH Metro had reported that Idoghor was detained by the police for allegedly failing to switch off the transformer, while the deceased was carrying out a sensitive task, and he was electrocuted. The BEDC claimed in a statement on Thursday that Obodo was not its employee and that Idoghor was not detained but was rather questioned when he went to report the matter at the Abraka Police Station. It said, “It is true that there was an incident of electrocution along the Police Station Road, Abraka, Delta State, on Monday, April 27, 2020. Preliminary investigation carried out revealed that it was a case of illegal reconnection of the circuit in a four-terminal LT pole that resulted in the electrocution of the victim. “The victim was not a BEDC staff member, but a roadside technician, who did not obtain clearance/permission before embarking on the illegal reconnection. “The Service Manager, Joshua Idogho, went to report the incident at the Abraka Police Station on Monday and was questioned and later released.” Copyright PUNCH.
