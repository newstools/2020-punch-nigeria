John Alechenu, Abuja Supporters of the All Progressives Congress under the aegis of the APC Youth Alliance, have described those opposed to the forensic audit of the accounts of the Niger Delta Development Commission as enemies of the Niger Delta region. National Coordinator of the group, Ugboma Stephen, said this in Abuja on Thursday. He said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), deserved commendation for extending the tenure of the NDDC interim management committee and approving funds to enable the commission to provide support for the COVID-19 fight coronavirus. Stephen said, “Those who genuinely love the Niger Delta know that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration means well for the area. What the administration needs now is the support of the people for our minister, Senator (Godswill) Akpabio and Prof. Keme Pondei to help clean up the mess going on in the NDDC for the benefit of the Niger Delta. “We urge our people not to allow our enemies use them to destroy the work being done to bring sanity into the system because only those who have skeletons in their cupboards are against the forensic audit, those whose hands are clean obviously have nothing to fear.” He further explained that the people of the region had suffered untold hardships in the hands of some of its unpatriotic sons and daughters in the past but that the current administration was doing all within its power to change the narrative for the better.
