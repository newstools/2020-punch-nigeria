Two Nigerians have been rated among the richest sports stars of the world who are aged 30 or under. According to a list unveiled by Sunday Times in Britain, Anthony Joshua is ranked the second richest after Gareth Bale of Real Madrid. Joshua is also the only non-footballer, on the list dominated by Manchester United players. This may not be a surprise as Manchester United is one of the wealthiest clubs in the world. Odion Ighalo, a new entrant into the list, is number 15.  He is one of the five Manchester United players rated. Joining them is goalkeeper David de Gea. The Spaniard – who became Manchester United’s highest-paid star after signing a new £375000-a-week contract in September – is joint-fourth at £34m. In the top 18 Anthony Joshua is the only non-footballer having made the cut. The boxer sits second in the list with a wealth of £107m. This is an increase of £58m from 2019 – the biggest fortune rise of anyone. The 30-year-old made the majority of that money from his two bouts with Andy Ruiz Jnr. The first fight – which resulted in a shock loss – took place at Madison Square Garden, New York in June.
