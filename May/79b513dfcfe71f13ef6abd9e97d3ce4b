Adeniyi Olugbemi, Sokoto Governor Aminu  Tambuwal of Sokoto State has announced the discharge of 22 COVID-19 patients from health facilities in the state. Before their discharge, the patients were isolated and treated in two of the state isolation facilities. According to the state Commissioner for Health and Chairman of the state task force on COVID-19, Dr Muhammad Inname, who addressed journalists on behalf of the governor, 19 patients had hitherto been discharged after they were certified healthy and free from the virus. “This brings to 41 the total number of COVID-19 patients, out of 176 cases, so far discharged by the task force,” Tambuwal emphasised. Describing the current discharge as “the highest so far achieved by the state,” the governor reiterated that “being COVID-19 isn’t a death sentence in any way.” “This development shows that many of those infected by the disease do recover and go about their normal activities.” The governor implored the people of the state to avoid stigmatisation of anyone infected by the virus.” In his remarks, Inname said the task force was doing its best to ensure that it curbed the spread of the disease by screening each of the suspected cases. He added that the task force was intensifying efforts at tracing the contacts of those infected. “Contact tracing is ongoing. We have identified 844 contacts, tested 436 suspected cases and certified that 176 cases are positive,” the commissioner explained. Copyright PUNCH.
