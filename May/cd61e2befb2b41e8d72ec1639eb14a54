Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has maintained that the demolition of the two hotels in Eleme Local Government Area of the state was done in line with extant laws, saying the state government has done no wrong. Speaking during a state-wide broadcast on Sunday night, Wike explained that the owner of the two hotels unleashed thugs to attack members of the state task force that went to enforce the law against their continued operations. The governor added that most of the task force members sustained severe head injuries from the attack. He said, “We acted against the hotelier because apart from using the facility to jeopardise the lives of our citizens in violation of the extant law, the owner audaciously unleashed thugs led by the Eleme Local Government Youth Leader of the Peoples Democratic Party and inflicted severe injuries on our task force members, who went to enforce the law against the continued operation of the hotel.
