In a statement, FRSC Corps Marshal, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, told the members of the team to collaborate with other security agencies and the COVID-19 task force teams in the country towards achieving a crash and hitch-free celebration. Oyeyemi said the team begins operations effective May 22 and their operations would last through May 30. He said the officers would also ensure that motorists strictly adhere to physical distancing, compulsory use of face mask, amongst others while adding that their mandate also included ensuring the “free flow of traffic, prompt removal of obstructions and timely rescue services in the event of any road traffic crash”. “The strategies deployed are anchored on achieving a decline in transmission of the virus amongst commuters and the need to mitigate the attendant risks of road traffic crashes,” the FRSC boss stated.
