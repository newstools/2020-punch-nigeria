Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, sitting in Abuja, on Thursday, reserved judgment on the petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party and its candidate in the November 16, 2019 election in the state, Musa Wada. The petitioners are challenging the victory of Governor Yahaya Bello of the All Progressives Congress at the poll. The three-man panel of judges headed by Justice Kashim Kaigama reserved judgment in the case after parties adopted their final written addresses on Thursday. Petitioners’ lawyer, Jibril Okutepa (SAN), in his closing argument, urged the court to uphold the petition and order Wada to be returned as the duly elected Governor of Kogi State.

They noted that that the petitioners disputed the results of the election in 2,548 polling units in seven out of the 21 Local Government Areas of the state, yet they only presented 32 witnesses to prove cases of alleged election malpractices, substantial non-compliance to electoral rules and other forms of irregularities.
