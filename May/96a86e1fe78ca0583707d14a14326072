Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Kaduna State Commissioner for Health, Dr Amina Mohammed-Baloni, said security agents have successfully tracked down two COVID-19 positive persons who fled their homes shortly after they were notified of their test results. The commissioner had earlier raised the alarm that the whereabouts of the two patients tested positive for  COVID-19 pandemic in the state were unknown. Mohammed-Baloni, however, said in a statement on Sunday evening that “the man and woman involved are now at the Kaduna State Government  isolation centre for treatment.” The commissioner recalled that the “two patients had been isolating in their respective homes pending receipt of their test results. They both switched off their phones and remained incommunicado once they were informed of their positive test results.” She appealed to residents to take precautions and protect themselves and their families from COVID-19. “However, persons who get infected should note that COVID-19 is not a death sentence,” Mohammed-Baloni said, adding that “persons who receive treatment promptly have a higher chance of defeating the disease.” “Twelve persons have so far been discharged in Kaduna State after receiving treatment and our health professionals are working hard for the recovery of other patients,’’ she stated.
