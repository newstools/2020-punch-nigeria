Starting your first game and scoring your first goal at the same time, it’s something you’ll always cherish in your life. In the years to come, I’ll look back at my first start for the team and my first goal. “The atmosphere in the stadium was mad, the fans were singing and supporting the team. They were supporting me and signing my name and that gave me more courage and more spirit to fight, to score even more. I’m very happy about that. It’s going to be in my head forever. “It was a great game and we won 5-0 after the away game, when we drew 1-1. “Coming home to Old Trafford, we knew we needed to win that game for us to go into the next round. We started so well, we were pressing up high and tried to attack from start to finish. It was a great display from the team – 5-0 in the Europa League is not easy.”
