Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, on Friday, said the state was planning to reduce its 2020 budget from N200bn to N160bn due to plummeting prices of crude oil in the global market. He also said he was not voted into office to share money to the people, but to execute projects that would have a meaningful impact on the life of the citizens. Abdulrazaq while answering questions from journalists during a broadcast commemorating his first anniversary in office, said he would not share money to the people “as was the practice during the tenure of past administrations in the state.” Instead, he said his administration would provide projects that would bring development to all parts of the state. Abdulrazaq said, “Let us make sure that we start delivering now with the right trajectory because our people voted for change and change has come to stay. People will continue to see the change. “Yes, some (persons) will complain that we’re not sharing money. We’re not doing this, we’re not doing that. We are not here to share money; we are here to share projects and infrastructure. We expect people to stay with us and stay focused.” On his achievements in the past one year, AbdulRazaq said 35 roads across the state were under reconstruction while five waterworks had been rehabilitated and were supplying  water to residents.
