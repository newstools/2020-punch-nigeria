Self-medication of any kind is fraught with the danger of increasing risks of avoidable casualties. “We, therefore strongly warn against self-medication. If you are sick, please seek medical advice, and if you are confirmed positive, kindly self-isolate in an approved facility. The COVID-19 is highly infectious and dangerous.”
