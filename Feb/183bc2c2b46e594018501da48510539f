Johnny Edward Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen is the third-highest scoring African player in Europe’s top leagues (EPL, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1), Sports Extra reports. The Nigeria international took his tally to 13 Ligue 1 goals in Lille’s 2-1 home loss to Olympique Marseille last Sunday. The strike was his 10th Ligue 1 goal at the Pierre Mauroy, scoring three away goals as well in the French topflight. The 21-year-old has scored 18 in all competitions for Lille since joining in the off-season from Belgian side Charleroi in a deal worth €12m. Osimhen, who has been heavily linked with a move away from the Pierre Mauroy this summer, is behind Arsenal and Gabonese captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Liverpool’s Egypt forward Mohamed Salah. The pair have scored 15 and 14 league goals respectively for their EPL teams this season. Liverpool’s Sadio Mane and FC Metz’s Habib Diallo, with 12 goals each, are both ranked fourth in the list according to football statistics website Whoscored. Copyright PUNCH.
