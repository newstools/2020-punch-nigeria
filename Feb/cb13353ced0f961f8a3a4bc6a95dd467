Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Subscribers to the Nationwide Workers’ Housing Scheme on Monday got involved in a face-off with the President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba, over the prolonged delay in the delivery of houses under the NWHS to workers. About 30 workers, representing over 130 employees who subscribed to the scheme in 2014, stormed the Abuja headquarters of the NLC on Monday to protest the non-delivery of the houses they paid for since the past eight years. Subscribers to the scheme also displayed various placards with inscriptions such as “NLC/TUC, FCT you have failed us,” “No more stories, no more excuses to injustice.” On sighting the protesters, the NLC president came down from his office and tried to pacify the subscribers but the situation degenerated into a shouting match as the workers kicked against some of the comments made by Waba. The labour union boss was, however, able to calm the angry workers after several attempts and revealed that the NLC in conjunction with the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory were making efforts to resolve the issues. Waba told the workers that Goodhomes Limited could not sell the land allocated to workers as he countered the allegation of subscribers that part of the land had been sold. Copyright PUNCH.
