Nike Popoola Ecobank Nigeria said it recently trained over 140 female business owners on digital marketing skills in its state-of-the-art academy as part of its initiative to continuously encourage female entrepreneurs in the country. The bank said in a statement that the empowerment programme organised by Ecobank Female Entrepreneurs Initiative drew participants from Lagos and its environs. EFEI programme, which was launched by Ecobank last year, was designed to recognise women as a separate market segment, it stated. It said the programme bundled empowerment and capacity building in form of training and seminars, networking events, loans, trade fairs and exhibition of customers’ products. Speaking at the event,  the Head, Consumer Asset Product, Ecobank Nigeria, Daberechi  Effiong, stated that the training focused on building participants’ digital marketing skills to boost their businesses online. She stated that apart from growing their businesses, the training would position them for increased participation, validation and contribution to their communities. Effiong, who is also the coordinator of Ecobank Female Entrepreneurs Initiative, explained that the training focused on social media marketing, search engine optimisation, content building and the Ecobank female entrepreneurs’ opportunities. “This is designed to provide them with the necessary support to excel in their endeavours, promote and grow their businesses,” she said.
