A financial services provider, Emerging Africa Capital Group, has unveiled a new investment class in real estate. The company said in a statement that the initiative was in line with its commitment to advancing the development of Africa through diverse investment and financing solutions. It said the initiative was in partnership with Citrine Estates & the Cyprus Investment Promotion Agency. The statement read in part, “Driven by the growth in global demand for luxury residential properties, Citrine Estates, presented by the CNS group, offers a premium investment opportunity in an exclusive development in Limassol. “The Citrine Estate project is in close proximity to the highly anticipated casino resort, the ‘City of Dreams Mediterranean’, Limassol Marina and the Paphos airport. “It, therefore, promises to be a key international destination and hotspot for a luxury lifestyle and keen real estate investors.” Emerging Africa said the investment was fully supported by Invest Cyprus, the dedicated partner of the government of Cyprus, which worked in close collaboration with all government authorities, public institutions and the private sector as an investor’s initial point of contact. The Chief Executive Officer, EAC Group, Toyin Sanni  said, “We at Emerging Africa will continue to collaborate with the best institutions across the globe in order to bring the most attractive investment opportunities to our clients towards the fulfilment of our vision to be the leading catalyst for Africa’s emergence as a key global investment origin and destination.” Copyright PUNCH.
