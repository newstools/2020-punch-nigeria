Samson Folarin A former Rector of Igbajo Polytechnic, Osun State, Mr Olaolu Akinola, has been arraigned by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission. Akinola was arraigned before an Osun State High Court on Wednesday on counts of forgery. This was two years after a series of investigations by our correspondent exposed the former rector as a serial forger. Not only was Akinola’s PhD certificate from the University of Ibadan forged, his BSc notification of results which he claimed he got from the University of Lagos was also discovered to be fake.
