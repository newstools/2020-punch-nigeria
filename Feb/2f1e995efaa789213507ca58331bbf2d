The Osun State Government has described as unfortunate and avoidable the face-off between the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, and the Agbowu of Ogbaagbaa town, Oba Sikirulahi Akinropo, during a peace meeting at the office of the Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of zone 11, Bashir Makama last Friday. This was contained in a statement signed on Monday by the state’s Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs. Funke Egbemode. Egbemode said the State Traditional Council was looking into the matter, adding that traditional rulers ought to protect and preserve the sacredness of traditional institutions. She said, “Situations, where royal fathers engage in a public display of temperament, do not edify the revered stools of our forebears.
