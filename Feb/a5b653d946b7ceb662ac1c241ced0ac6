Johnny Edward Super Eagles midfielder Oghenekaro Etebo has expressed his displeasure at Getafe’s 2-1 defeat to Barcelona at the Camp Nou in LaLiga on Saturday, Sports Extra reports. The defeat ended their four-game winning streak. Etebo returned to Getafe’s match-day squad after missing the last two games and he was deployed as a right midfielder in the encounter. However, he was later replaced in the 67th minute for Amath Ndiaye in what was his third appearance since arriving on a six months loan from English Championship club, Stoke City. “Disappointing results but we go again lads,” Etebo wrote on Twitter. Antoine Griezmann put Barcelona 1-0 ahead before Sergi Roberto doubled their lead in the 39th minute. Angel Rodriguez scored a consolatory goal in the 66th minute. Despite the defeat, Getafe remain third with 42 points from 24 games. Copyright PUNCH.
