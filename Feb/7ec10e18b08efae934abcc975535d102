Maiharaji Altine, Gusau Bandits have released the son of the District Head of Gayari town in Zamfara State, Yasir Mohammed, after collecting his motorcycle as ransom. It had been reported that the district head, Alhaji Hassan Mohammed, and his son, Yasir, were kidnapped by bandits. They released the monarch and held his son, demanding a brand new motorbike as ransom. The family members had raised the sum of N400,000 to buy the motorcycle, which they gave the bandits before they released Yasir. A family member of the victim, Alhaji Faruku Gayari, said, “When we realised that the bandits were not ready to release Yasir without the motorcycle, we had to tax ourselves to buy it and we took it to them.” Faruku stated that Yasir was released last Sunday night, but could not get home until around 12pm on Monday due to the long distance.
