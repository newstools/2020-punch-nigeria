Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe Properties worth millions of naira were destroyed on Sunday when fire gutted a plastic recycling factory and a building in the Agbado-Ijaiye area of Lagos State. Although the cause of the fire, which started around 3pm, could not be ascertained, PUNCH Metro learnt that the factory and six rooms in the boys’ quarter of a building in the neighbourhood were burnt. Our correspondent learnt that some hoodlums, however, attempted to steal some of the salvaged belongings of the victims of the inferno. It was gathered that the fire was curtailed by the combined efforts of the youth in the area and the personnel of the Lagos State Fire Service. Confirming the incident, the Head, Public Affairs Unit, Lagos State Fire Service, Jamiu Dosunmu, stated that two fire stations were sent to extinguish the inferno. “We receive a distress call around 3.35pm and we arrived at the scene of the incident around 3.45pm. The Agege and Abesan fire stations responded to the call. The factory was completely razed, while six rooms in the building were also burnt,” he said. Dosunmu said the prompt response of firefighters curtailed the spread of the inferno, adding that there were no casualties. Copyright PUNCH.
