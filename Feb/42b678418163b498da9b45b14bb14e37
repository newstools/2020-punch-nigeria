Kayode Oyero The General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has said every soul lost to insurgency is precious to God whether a Christian or a Muslim. Adeboye, who stated this on Sunday during the monthly Thanksgiving Service at the church’s National Headquarters in Ebute Meta, Lagos State, also said he would lead members of the church on a prayer walk from Ebute Meta to Atan Cemetery in Yaba metropolis and back. Adeboye led his congregation on prayers for the peace and security of the country, saying, “Lord, have mercy on Nigeria. Let there be peace and security in Nigeria. God sees all things and knows where the terrorists are hiding. We pray that God send His light to Nigeria and expose the evildoers in the country. “Every soul is precious to God whether a Christian or a Muslim. Father, we declare no more death of the innocent in Nigeria. “After the service, we are all going for a prayer walk. We’ll march according to our age. There are some who would march round the church because of their age and there are some who would march with me to Atan Cemetery and back.” The cleric prayed that God uproots all the sponsors of terrorism in Nigeria. He said, “It is written that if my people who are called by my name can humble themselves and call on me, I will heal their land” making reference to 2 Chronicles 7:14. Adeboye lamented that some countries now ban Nigerians from coming into their territories as he prayed for the restoration of the nation. He preached briefly on ‘Songs of Victory’ with text from Psalm 18:1-3 after which he led the congregation on the prayer walk. The Christian Association of Nigeria had declared a three-day fasting and prayer beginning January 31st to empower the government and military forces in the fight against terrorism and the spate of killings in the country. CAN President, Samson Ayokunle, had said the spiritual exercise would end today February 2 with a prayer walk.
