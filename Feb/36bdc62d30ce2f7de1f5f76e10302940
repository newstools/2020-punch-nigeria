Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Chief of the Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai, has relocated to the Operation Lafiya Dole Theatre in Maiduguri, Borno State, to boost the war against the new spate of terrorist attacks. A top source at the Defence Headquarters, Abuja, confirmed this to our correspondent, noting that Buratai’s visit was also connected to recent agitations and infighting among the troops. On Wednesday, the army confirmed that one of its corporals opened fire on his colleagues, killing four personnel, himself and injuring two others. The army’s Spokesman, Col Sagir Musa, said the mass shooting happened at the Army Super Camp 15, located at Malam Fatori, as the two injured personnel were rushed to a military hospital in Maiduguri, Borno State. “The recent happenings in the North-East have again necessitated the Chief of the Army Staff to relocate to the North-East. He is presently at the theatre of war, and his visit will include meetings with operation commanders and troops to find out what the lapses are,” an authoritative source told our correspondent. Boko Haram fighters, during the week, had intensified attacks on communities in Borno and Adamawa states, including the Chibok Local Government Area, where a top civilian task force commander and other residents were abducted.
