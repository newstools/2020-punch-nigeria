Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ogun State has suspended the state Secretary of the party, Semiu Sodipo, for attending a peace meeting held in Abuja. The PDP leadership in the state also dissociated itself from the meeting organised by the National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, with some members of the party from the two factions in the state. The meeting, which was purportedly held to unite the two factions, reportedly held at the PDP national secretariat on Wednesday. The two factions led by Bayo Dayo and Sikirulahi Ogundele, who were loyal to a former senator representing Ogun East, Buruji Kashamu,  and a former member of the House of  Representatives from  Remo-North federal constituency, Oladipupo  Adebutu. Addressing newsmen on Thursday at the party secretariat in Abeokuta, the chairman of the Kashamu faction of the party, Bayo Dayo, said the leadership of the party knew nothing about the peace meeting. He said, “Sunday Odunjo among others that were taken to Abuja are not our members, they have all resigned except Semiu Sodipo who was our secretary before his suspension.

Our former secretary who was present there had been suspended before now but we have been tackling that in-house and that is why we haven’t told you people. “They are aware of what is happening and if care is not taken, they will be taken to court for contempt of court at the end of the day.” Copyright PUNCH.
