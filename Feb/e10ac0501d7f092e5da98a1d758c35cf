Armstrong Bakam The Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has suspended the Chairman, Caretaker Committee, Kirfi Local Government Area of the state, Alhaji Baffa Bara, after he was invited by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on “issues of financial impropriety.” The government said it viewed his invitation by the anti-graft agency as an “embarrassment” to the administration that could not be tolerated. This was contained in a statement by the governor’s Senior Special Assistant on Media, Mukhtar Gidado, on Sunday. He said, “The suspension was due to his nonchalant attitude in running the affairs of the local government and other issues of financial impropriety, which culminated in his invitation by the EFCC. “This the state views as a very serious embarrassment that cannot be tolerated.” According to Gidado, the government further observed that the suspended chairman had not been engaging stakeholders from the local government as directed by the governor. Bara is the third council chairmen that has been suspended by the government in less than two months. The PUNCH had reported that Mohammed, on January 10, suspended the caretaker committee chairmen of the Ningi and Darazo local government areas, Nura Dan-Maishari’a and Gara’u Adamu, respectively.
