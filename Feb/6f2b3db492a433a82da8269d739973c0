The soldier who gunned down 26 people before being shot dead by commandos in northeastern Thailand did it over a “personal problem”, Thai premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha said Sunday. “It is unprecedented in Thailand, and I want this to be the last time this crisis happens,” he said outside a hospital where victims were sent after they were evacuated from the shopping mall where the 17-hour rampage took place. Prayut added that the gunman’s motive was linked to the sale of a house. (AFP)
