Sodiq Oyeleke The Lagos State State Government has begun a search for all the contacts of the Italian who brought coronavirus to Nigeria. This was contained in a press statement by the Ministry of Health in Lagos State on Friday.

The Lagos State Ministry of Health, in collaboration with Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, will continue to provide updates and will initiate all measures required to prevent the spread of the outbreak in Lagos,” he added.
