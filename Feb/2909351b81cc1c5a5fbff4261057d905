Friday Olokor, Abuja The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), on Wednesday, received more knocks following his comment that 90 per cent of victims of the Boko Harm insurgency were Muslims. The knocks came from the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union and Ecumenical Youth Association in separate interviews with The PUNCH in Abuja. The President of SOKAPU and former member of the House of Representatives, Jonathan Asake, and President of EYA, Daboikiabo Warmate, claimed for such comments Buhari had revealed his true identity as an ethnic bigot and should therefore resign. Asake said, “Buhari’s statement goes to confirm that Nigeria is indeed putting up with a President who does not have regard for the sensibilities of people of other faiths, other than his own. “It is incomprehensible, appalling and totally disgusting to hear such utterances from the lips of a man that is supposed to be the father of all, irrespective of one’s ethnicity or religion. “His recent reckless and unsubstantiated utterances confirm clearly that President Buhari is a President for a particular ethnic group and religious sect. “Take for instance, over 90 per cent of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls were Christians. Of the abducted Dapchi schoolgirls, the only Christian among them, Leah Sharibu, is yet to be rescued because Buhari’s government paid ransom for all the Muslim girls and left her out. It is a shame for this nation and an insult on our collective sensibilities for a President to talk to his citizens with such recklessness.” For Warmate, the President’s “statements, body language and silence” have encouraged the unabated killing of Christians by bandits, Fulani herdsmen, Boko Haram and ISWAP. He said, “We, therefore, lend our voice to the millions of Nigerians calling for the resignation of President Buhari for the unprecedented insecurity in Nigeria, him and his Minister of Information and Culture’s false claims that deserved to be in the world Guinness Book of Records.”
