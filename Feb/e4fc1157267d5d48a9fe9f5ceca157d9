Ife Ogunfuwa 9mobile says it is investing $220m in the expansion of its 4G LTE to more Nigerian cities as part of efforts to deepen broadband penetration in the country. The company at a press conference in Lagos on Thursday said it had added 10 new cities and towns across Nigeria to its 4G network and upgraded LTE services in existing six cities. The Ag. Managing Director, Stephane Beuvelet, explained that the investment had increased the number of cities and towns in Nigeria that now enjoy quality service with the mass deployment of 4G technology to 16. According to him, the 4G LTE expansion drive will be implemented in Aba, Abuja, Nasarawa, Calabar, Enugu, Kaduna, Kano, Lagos, Niger, Onitsha, Owerri, Port Harcourt, Sokoto, Uyo, Aba and Ogun. He stated that the company planned to cover the entire country in the next five years.
