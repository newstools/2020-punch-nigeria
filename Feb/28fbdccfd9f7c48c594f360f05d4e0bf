Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna. After the payment of N8m ransom, bandits suspected to be kidnappers have released two minors in Kaduna State. The two children were the children of a Kaduna – based medical doctor, Dr. Philip Ataga. They were kidnapped along with their mother at Juji community, Cjukin Local Government Area of Kaduna State on Friday, January 24, 2020. The kidnappers killed their mother while negotiation on how to raise N120m ransom demanded by the kidnappers to free the children and their mother was ongoing. But their mother and wife of Dr. Ataga was killed and the kidnappers demanded N20m before they could set the two minors free from their den. A source told one of our correspondents that the two kids were reunited with their devastated father on Thursday night. “It was an unfortunate incident, hat after killing my wife, you ask that I should bring N20m to get my children back to me. Its most unfortunate. That’s what we find ourselves in an unsecured environment like ours at the moment. “We have cried out on several occasions for the security of lives and property of our community. No one would listen but when its time for an election, you find them coming around to canvass votes. Nowhere is safe. That after the killing of his wife, he now parted with N7m or N8m to save his children. It is that bad.” The Kaduna State Police Command as of the time of filing this report, had yet you confirm the release of the children. The State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP, Yakubu Sabo, perhaps in a crowded environment, simply told our correspondent in a huss voice, “I can’t talk please.”
