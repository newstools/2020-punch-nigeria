Agunbiade added that the bill was incorporating the concept of a more dynamic and more strengthened security platform than what they had in the state. He said, “It is meant to energise and strengthen the security that we have in Lagos State based on the challenges in the state and in the South-West. “It tries to create a unit out of the LNSC to be referred to as Amotekun Corps to take charge of security in certain areas such as in the forest, highway and other places to protect us against hoodlums, cattle rustling and others. “It will have a commander and Amotekun Corps will bear arms with the permission of the police. “They will cooperate with other security platforms in Ondo, Oyo, Ogun, Ekiti and Osun States.”
