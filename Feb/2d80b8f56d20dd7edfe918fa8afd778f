Seun Adesoye The Cross River State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, has said the availability of “intellectual money” is the reason his administration has been able to execute many capital intensive projects despite dwindling revenue allocation. The governor, who spoke in Calabar, said without “intellectual money,” the state would have been in a deep financial mess. He said because of “intellectual money,” low federal allocations had not stalled progress of work on his signature projects, including the 275-kilometre superhighway connecting Cross River with northern Nigeria. “The use of intellect to make up for naira and kobo is what is called intellectual money. Intellectual currency is stronger than paper currency and so where there is a deficiency of funds, the intellect takes over,” Ayade explained. The governor expressed satisfaction with the progress of work being done on the projects. Copyright PUNCH.
