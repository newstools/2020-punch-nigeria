The Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, has advised contractors handling expansion of section 1, Aba–Ikot Ekpene road to deploy equipment and workers locally to hasten the project. Fashola was quoted as saying in a statement on Friday in Abuja signed by Mr Stephen Kilebi, Deputy Director, Public Relations, in the ministry, the News Agency of Nigeria has said. He directed that all the bad portions of the road must be repaired before the rains start. Fashola said: “Try and repair the bad portions first before the rains come so that the people will know that government cares about them.’’ The minister said the contract was initially awarded to a company but had to be terminated due to poor performance and re-awarded to Messrs CGGC Global Projects Nig. Limited. Fashola assured the contractor that the project would not be abandoned due to lack of funds as it had been enlisted for SUKUK funding. He further said other bad portions of the Odukpani–Itu road, which many people did not understand the contractual responsibilities, had been awarded to another company. Copyright PUNCH.
