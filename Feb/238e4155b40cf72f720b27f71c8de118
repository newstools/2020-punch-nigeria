Umar Muhammed, Lafia The Nasarawa State Government on Wednesday prescribed 10 years’ imprisonment for parents who subject their children to street begging. Similarly, Governor Abdullahi Sule has also assented to the Protection of Children and Implementation of the Child’s Right Protection Executive Order. The law read partly, “This law, apart from the prohibition of street begging, provides punishment for parents who, out of irresponsibility, threw away their children to street begging.” It also prescribed stringent punishments such as life imprisonment and death penalty for perpetrators of kidnapping in the state, adding that buildings used in keeping victims of heinous crimes would henceforth be forfeited to the government.
