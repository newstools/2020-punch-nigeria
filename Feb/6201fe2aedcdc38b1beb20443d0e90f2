Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja The Federal Government has unveiled plans to place an outright ban on the importation of barite into the country. Nigeria has abundant reserves of barite, an industrial mineral that is used in oil exploration but the International Oil Companies are importing the material into the country for their operations. Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, on Thursday disclosed that banning the importation of barite was part of the governmentâ€™s long-term plan in the mining sector. Adegbite spoke at a Stakeholders Forum on Local Barite Development in Nigeria in Abuja. He explained that the ban would come into force when local production of barite was able to meet the needs of the IOCs operating in the country. Copyright PUNCH.
