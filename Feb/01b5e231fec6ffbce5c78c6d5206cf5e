Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The police in Ekiti State, on Wednesday, confirmed the arrest of three secondary school teachers for allegedly having carnal knowledge of some of their female pupils. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Sunday Abutu, said the suspects currently being detained at the police headquarters in Ado Ekiti were from the Osi Grammar School, Osi Ekiti, in the Ido/Osi Local Government Area of the state, and the All Souls’ Grammar School in Ado Ekiti. Abutu said the teachers were reported to the police through a petition received from a source that the suspects sexually molested the victims. The police spokesperson said, “The suspects, who were alleged to have had sexual intercourse with the pupils, one from the Osi Grammar School and two from the All Souls’ Grammar School, are in our custody and they are giving us useful information. “We have invited the victims to give useful information to us. But as of now, the victim from the Osi Grammar School denied the allegation while being interrogated. “But, we are not resting on that; we will get to the root of the matter.” Abutu said the victims from All Souls’ had been invited by the police for interrogation, adding that they had yet to give information on the incident.
