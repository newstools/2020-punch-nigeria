Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Sunday,  fumed over  the alleged excesses of security men and paramilitary officers in the state’s border towns while implementing the 20-kilometre ban on fuel supply in the areas. The governor said a special and dedicated telephone number would be activated where citizens could lodge complaints. Abiodun, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, said  when fully operational, citizens would have a  direct access to the government to  complain about harassment and intimidation by security men at the border areas. The governor spoke while reacting to complaints by members of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, South-West chapter, who visited him in his office in Oke Mosan, Abeokuta. IPMAN had embarked on an industrial action on account of the allegations of extortion by security agents along the corridor. The governor noted that as an investor-friendly government, his administration would not allow investors like petroleum marketers to be harassed. He said “We will be having a citizens complaints number. This will be a dedicated number that anyone who feels harassed, intimidated or extorted can call round the clock. “No law enforcement agency, traffic agency or revenue agency is allowed to misbehave in Ogun State. Meanwhile, there had been a partial scarcity of fuel in some parts of the state on Friday following the industrial action by the IPMAN . But, it was called off later as a result of the intervention of the governor. Copyright PUNCH.
