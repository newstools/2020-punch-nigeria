SOLA SHITTU Five members of staff of Okomu Oil plc in Edo State were on Friday night burnt to death in a road accident that occurred along Iguobazuwa road in the Ovia South West Local Government Area of the state. Two other persons, who were also critically injured in the incident, are currently receiving treatment in a hospital. Eyewitness accounts said the bus conveying the workers were going to the head office at Okomu from Extension 2 of the farm when it rammed into a lorry that broke down on the road and burst into flames. Several motorists and passengers were stranded as the burning vehicles blocked the highway. An eyewitness said help could not reach the victims trapped in the vehicle as the fire raged. A top official of the firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the incident, describing it as unfortunate and “a sad day for workers in the firm.” “We have yet to confirm the total number of our personnel involved but we have confirmed five deaths. Two are in the hospital. They were coming to the head office from Extension 2,” he said. Copyright PUNCH.
