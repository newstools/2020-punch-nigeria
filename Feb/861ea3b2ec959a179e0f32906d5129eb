Gibson Achonu, Owerri A legal practitioner, Nelson Okedinachi, has asked a Federal High Court sitting in Owerri, the Imo State capital, to declare the seats of the Speaker and 19 other members of the state House of Assembly vacant. He made the request based on the fact that the lawmakers defected from their political parties namely – the Peoples Democratic Party, All Progressives Grand Alliance and the Action Alliance to join the All Progressives Congress. Okedinachi, in a suit number FHC/OW/CS/20/2020, asked the court to determine whether, upon proper interpretation of Section 109 (1)(g) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the defected lawmakers were not liable to vacate their seats as members of the Imo State House of Assembly, having defected from their original political parties to the APC. The lawyer sought an order of the court to declare the lawmakers’ seats vacant. He also prayed the court to direct the affected lawmakers to return to the state treasury all salaries, allowances and benefits paid to them as members of the state House of Assembly. Some of the affected lawmakers are the Speaker, Chiji Collins (Isiala Mbano); Majority Leader, Chigozie Nwaneri (Oru East); Amarachi Chyna Iwuanyanwu (Nwangele); Innocent Egwim(Ideato North); Dominic Ezerioha (Oru West); and Chidiebere Ogbunikpa (Okigwe) among others.
