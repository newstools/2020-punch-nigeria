Pakistan, on Monday, said it was resuming flights to and from China, three days after it suspended them because of the coronavirus outbreak in China. The decision runs counter to many other airlines and governments that have tightened travel restrictions and suspended more flights in response to the fast-spreading virus, which is thought to have originated in China’s Hubei province. “We are resuming flight operations with China,’’ said Additional Secretary of Aviation, Abdul Sattar Khokhar. Khokhar added that a China Southern Airlines flight, carrying 145 passengers, would arrive in Islamabad later.
