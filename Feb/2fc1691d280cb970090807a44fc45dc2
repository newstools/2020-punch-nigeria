Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The six-month suspension slammed on the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed, by the Osun State Traditional Council last Friday, has been described by his kinsmen, as “harsh, undeserved.” The Oluwo in Council, in a statement by its secretary, Kamoru Ademola, however, accepted the decision of the traditional council to suspend the monarch. The group explained that Oba Akanbi did not assault Agbowu of Ogbaagbaa or any other monarch, adding that the Oluwo would abide by the decision of Osun Obas on the issue. The statement read, “The Oluwo in council regrets the unfortunate incident that transpired between the Agbowu of Ogbaagbaa and Oluwo of Iwo last week. “We will also like to put it on record that the Oluwo did not at anytime assault the Agbowu or any other oba for that matter. “However, we respect the decision of the Osun State Council of Obas to suspend the Oluwo from the council of Obas meetings; though the suspension was harsh and undeserved, the Oluwo will abide by it.” Oba Akanbi told our correspondent on the telephone on Monday that he had no further comment on the issue.
