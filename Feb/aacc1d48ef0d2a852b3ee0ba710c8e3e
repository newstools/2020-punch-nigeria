INEC has subsequently presented his Certificate of Return to him. Supreme Court had nullified the All progressives Congress victory of November 16 governorship election. The Supreme Court had ruled that Lyonâ€™s Deputy, Degi Ereminyo, submitted forged certificates that disqualified the joint ticket and nomination. The court asked the Independent National Electoral Commission to withdraw the Certificate of Return issued to them and reissue the same to the next party with the required constitutional spread.
