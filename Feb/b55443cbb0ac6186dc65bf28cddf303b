Kelvin Ekerete Super Eagles forward, Henry Onyekuru, is beaming with excitement after helping Galatasaray to a 4-1 win over Kayserispor in a Turkish Super Lig game on Sunday on his return to the Turk Telkom Stadium. Onyekuru missed Galatasaray’s first four games in the second half of the season since rejoining the club on loan from Monaco due to an illness he contracted during his holiday in Nigeria. But on Sunday, the 22-year-old came on for Omer Bayram in the 83rd minute and made an instant impact, providing an assist for Sofiane Feghouli’s goal in the 94th minute of the encounter. Reacting to the game, the 22-year-old thanked the fans for accepting him on his return. “Felt great to comeback in front of the home fans. The atmosphere was amazing as always. Happy that we got the three points and I could contribute with an assist,” he posted on Instagram. Copyright PUNCH.
