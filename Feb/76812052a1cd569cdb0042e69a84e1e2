Umar Muhammed, Lafia Tiv farmers in the Giza Development Area of the Keana Local Government Area of Nasarawa State have petitioned the state Commissioner of Police over what they allege is a plot by powerful individuals to confiscate their land, measuring over 1,000 hectares. The farmers, who reside in the Amutu community, accused a political leader and a traditional ruler of threatening the public peace by laying claim to the land. In a petition signed on behalf of the community by Mr John Mbakuuv, Mr Igbasuwe Akaahaa, Mr Viashima Ihyom and Mr Thomas Ujo, a copy of which was made available to Northern City News on Tuesday, the petitioners urged the police and other concerned authorities to intervene in order to forestall a possible breakdown of law and order. The petition read in part, “Sir, as law-abiding citizens, we reported the matter to our paramount ruler, the Sangari Giza, of the move by the said council chairman to forcefully take over our farmlands, but to our greatest surprise, the Sangari Giza seems to be collaborating with the chairman on this illegal move. “We view this as a conspiracy and a calculated attempt to deny us the right to farming, which is our only source of livelihood. “It is on the basis of the impending security threat posed by the action of the duo that we, as a peace-loving community, wish to formally lodge this complaint and at the same time alert your office of the security threat.” The petitioner reminded the authorities concerned that they had over the years lived peacefully with other residents of the community and were prepared to continue to do so without fear of molestation.
