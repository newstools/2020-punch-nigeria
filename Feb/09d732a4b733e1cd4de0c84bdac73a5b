Friday Olokor The Director of Voter Education and Publicity of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Oluwole Uzzi, has said the commission has not ruled out diaspora and electronic voting in the 2023 general elections. He explained that the commission was currently constrained by the fact that there is no constitutional backing for the idea at present. Uzzi, who made the clarification on Sunday, said INEC was prepared to obey whatever the law said concerning the issue. He noted that for now, only persons who were duly registered in Nigeria and turn up at the appropriate time at designated polling units were allowed to vote. Oluwole-Uzzi, was asked to clarify whether INEC was ready for diaspora and electoral voting in 2023, since about 17 million Nigerians in the diaspora were seeking to participate in the electoral process. He said, “INEC will go with what the law stipulates. For now, only those registered in Nigeria at the time of registration and who turn up at the appropriate polling unit can vote. Until this constitutional provision is amended, we cannot talk of diaspora voting. “Electronic voting isn’t part of our law and isn’t envisaged even in the Electoral Amendment Bill before the National Assembly.” Copyright PUNCH.
