Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti An Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court, on Wednesday, remanded three men, Omolayo Ojo, 40; Taiwo Akinyemi, 47; and Ismaila Akadiri, 52, in a correctional facility over N75m fraud. Chief Magistrate Adesoji Adegboye, after listening to the parties, ordered that the defendants be remanded pending the outcome of the advice from the office of Director of Public Prosecutions. Adegboye adjourned the case till March 13 for further hearing. The police prosecutor, Inspector Johnson Okunade, had earlier alleged that the defendants, on October 31, 2019, unlawfully defrauded a legal luminary and founder of the Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, Chief Afe Babalola, of N75m. “The offences of fraud and perjury contravene sections (8) and 1(3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences Act and Section 118 of the Criminal Code,” Okunade stated. He added that two others also involved in the case were still at large. The police prosecutor said he had duplicated the case file and sent it to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for legal advice. The counsel for the defendants, Mr Ope Ademoyegun, however, prayed the court for a short adjournment. Copyright PUNCH.
