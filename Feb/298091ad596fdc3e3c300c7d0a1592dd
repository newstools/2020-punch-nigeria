Arsenal are keen for Arsene Wenger to attend a match at the Emirates in a bid to boost Mikel Artetaâ€™s overhaul of the club. Wenger ended a 22-year reign at Arsenal in 2018, but his successor Unai Emery has already been sacked by the Gunners. The Frenchman, aged 70, has said that he will always be an Arsenal fan but is reluctant to return following his acrimonious departure. He left a year before his final contract was due to expire after he was hounded out by angry supporters. But now senior figures are ready to talk to Wenger about returning to the Emirates, according to Daily Mirror. Wenger won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups, including the Double in 1998 and 2002, during his 22-year reign. Wenger has since taken up a role with FIFA and the move could help unify the supporter base behind new manager Arteta.
