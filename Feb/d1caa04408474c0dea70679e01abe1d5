Ebenezer Bajela Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has blamed Alex Iwobi for Arsenal’s equaliser against Everton in their English Premier League clash at the Emirate Stadium on Sunday. The Gunners defeated the Toffees 3-2 in a thrilling encounter at the Emirates. Iwobi failed to close down Bukayo Saka, whose cross was coolly finished by Eddie Nketiah in the 27th minutes. Saka, who has been impressing in recent weeks, replaced  Sead Kolasinac after 18 minutes in the encounter after he copped an elbow injury. “(Alex) Iwobi goes to sleep a little bit but he doesn’t do too much wrong. But that cross, wow. There is not a lot a defender can do about that and neither can the goalkeeper,” Neville told The Mirror. “The quality of the cross was absolutely outstanding. All you want is your striker in that position and he (Nketiah) is. He gets a good contact on it.” Copyright PUNCH.
