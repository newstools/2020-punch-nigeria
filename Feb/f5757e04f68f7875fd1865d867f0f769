’Tosin Oluwalowo After failing to qualify for the taekwondo event of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Chinazum Nwosu has set her sights on winning a medal at the 2021 World Taekwondo Championships in Wuxi, China. Nwosu, who is the African champion in the F-57kg weight category, lost in the semi-final of the Olympics qualifier in Rabat, Morocco to Niger Republic’s Tekiath Ben. Speaking with the Nigeria Taekwondo Federation’s website after the team returned to the country, Nwosu said she was shattered missing the Olympics for the second time, after preparing for four years. “I have prepared and waited for this day for the past four years, and I am shattered and gutted that this has happened for the second time. As the African champion, everyone was prepared for me, and on the match that mattered most, I did not provide the needed answers,” she said. “I congratulate Tekiath on making it to her first Olympics. There must be winners and losers in sports and at this time, the ovation did not go my way. Let all the qualified athletes from Africa now go and make the continent proud in Tokyo. “Winning a world championships medal in China next year will go long way to dampen this sharp pain I feel from losing this Olympic ticket. It will be hard very mentally, and I will pick myself up and keep moving.” Copyright PUNCH.
