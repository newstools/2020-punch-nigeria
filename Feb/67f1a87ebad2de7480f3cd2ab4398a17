Tobi Aworinde, Abuja The Nigeria Medical Association has debunked claims on social media that chloroquine phosphate is a cure for coronavirus, aka COVID-19, saying the anti-malaria drug is not a proven antidote. According to the China News Service, in late January, Chinese medical researchers stated that, in exploratory research considering a selection of 30 drug candidates, three of them, remdesivir, chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, seemed to have “fairly good inhibitory effects” on coronavirus at the cellular level. But the NMA President, Dr. Adedayo Faduyile, in a telephone interview with The PUNCH, stated that researchers had not “established” chloroquine as a remedy for the pandemic disease. Faduyile also noted that there was no chloroquine in the country since its use was stopped several years ago after the malaria parasite developed a resistance to the drug.

So, that is the situation. “(My advice) is just for us to be careful against coronavirus and to guard against it coming into the country.”
