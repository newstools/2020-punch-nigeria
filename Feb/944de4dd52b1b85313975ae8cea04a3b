Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State Government has revoked the contract for the rehabilitation of Ayede-Ikun-Otun Ekiti Road awarded at the cost of N3.2bn Ekiti State Commissioner for Information, Mr Muyiwa Olumilua, while announcing the decision, said the contractor, Sharvet Nigeria Limited, who got the contract early in January 2020, breached the terms of the contract hence the decision to revoke it. Olumilua said, “The government took the action owing to gross incompetence exhibited by the construction firm. We have a policy under Governor Kayode Fayemi government, when we award a contract, we expect the contractor to first mobilise to site and display capacity before financial mobilisation by government. “We awarded four road contracts at the same time in January but unfortunately, Sharvet Nigeria Limited refused to mobilise to site while the three others are already working as agreed. “Anytime we award contracts, we believe we are dealing with a contractor that has the competence and once this is lacking and we don’t want our people to suffer.” Copyright PUNCH.
