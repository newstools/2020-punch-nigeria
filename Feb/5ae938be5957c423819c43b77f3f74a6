Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, on Wednesday said the Federal Government was committed to a minimum of 70 per cent broadband penetration by 2025. The minister spoke when a delegation from Phase 3 Telecoms Limited led by its Executive Chairman, Mr Stanley Jegede, paid him a courtesy visit in Abuja. Pantami said the Digital Economy Policy and Strategy for digital Nigeria could not be achieved without adequate broadband penetration in the country. He said, “Whatever we do, we rely so much on broadband penetration. “That is why any effort to complement what we have been doing to ensure broadband penetration, even for one kilometre, is highly commendable.” The minister said the main responsibility of the government was to provide an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive. He said, “The main responsibility of government is to ensure that the environment is favourable and conducive and if there are any challenges, government will intervene. “This is what we will continue to do and I assure you within the time I am going to spend here, I will give 100 per cent to ensure that all the challenges we encounter are addressed.” Pantami added that the government was waiting for the report of the National Broadband Plan Committee 2020-2025. He said it was important to bridge the gap because broadband penetration was directly proportional to Gross Domestic Product of a country. Copyright PUNCH.
