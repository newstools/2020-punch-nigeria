Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja The Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mustapha Shehuri, has said the ministry, in collaboration with African Development Bank, will develop special agro-industrial processing zones in the country. He said the zones would enable both local and foreign partners to advance the level of trade and investments in the agricultural sector. The minister said the move was also vital as it would form part of the strategy of government to diversify the economy. He said these during the Ecobank Agribusiness Summit with the theme “Unlocking productivity and investment opportunities across Nigeria’s agribusiness value chain.” Shehuri, according to a statement from the ministry, noted that there was a need for a viable synergy of all the relevant stakeholders in the agricultural sector to ensure food security.
