Ted Odogwu, Kano A Federal High Court sitting in Kano on Friday dismissed the preliminary report of the Kano Anti-graft Commission, which recommended the suspension of Emir Muhammad Sanusi II over alleged misappropriation of the Emirate Council’s N3.5 billion. Delivering his ruling, Justice O.A. Egwuata, contended that the anti-graft commission erred for denying Emir Sanusi the opportunity to be heard before releasing the said report on him, stressing that such an omission was against the principle of fair hearing.

To this extent, Emir Sanusi sought an order from the court to set aside the preliminary report, as it relates to his indictment for fraud, misappropriation, as well as the recommendation for suspension by the Commission. In addition to the Emir’s prayers, the court also awarded him N200,000 as damages. This is coming after the Kano State High Court presided over by Justice Suleiman Na’Mallam also restrained the anti-graft commission from continuing with its probe against Emir Sanusi.
