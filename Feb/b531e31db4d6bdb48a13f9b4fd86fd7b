Olufemi Atoyebi, Abuja The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Dr Ibrahim Oloriegbe, has said there was a need for the organised sector to set aside an emergency disease control fund to contain epidemic outbreaks that might affect members of their staff. Speaking at a programme organised by the Nigeria Healthwatch titled, ‘Legislating epidemics’ in Abuja, Oloriegbe said he was waiting for a brief from the Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, on its plan for the N70m released by the federal government for Port Health Services to scale up its activities. According to him, there was the need to create an emergency funding plan for the prevention of epidemic in Nigeria, stating that companies whose business activities were mainly affected by the epidemic outbreak should be made to set aside a fund for disease control through legislation.

I advocate for a new way of funding and not through budget alone. When an epidemic occurs, it will have a devastating effect on the economy. This affects businesses, so the organised sector has to come up not through donation but a legislative action that will identify certain sources of fund. “We can come up with a plan to tax certain profit of key sector that is usually affected by epidemic so that the fund goes into the additional fund from public funding. Currently, we have one per cent of the consolidated revenue fund. Currently, there is no legislation that NCDC should receive a certain amount from that one per cent. “It is only through policy guideline that it received 2.5 per cent of the fund. We need to legislate that and increase it.”
