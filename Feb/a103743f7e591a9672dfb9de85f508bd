Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency says it has completed the calibration of the Instrument Landing System on Runway 18 Left of the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos. The agency said it was also working on Runway 18 Right of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport but did not give the timeline for the completion. The General Manager, Public Affairs of NAMA, Mr Khalid Emele, confirmed the development to The PUNCH on Wednesday. “Calibration has been completed on the glide slope of 18 Left, 18 Right is ongoing,” he said. However, in a Notice to Airmen issued on Wednesday evening, NAMA said both 18 Left and 18 Right had been calibrated and were operational. The Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, had last week, following the diversion of international flights to neighbouring countries and cancellation of some domestic flights, said some components of the ILS were faulty and would be serviced.
