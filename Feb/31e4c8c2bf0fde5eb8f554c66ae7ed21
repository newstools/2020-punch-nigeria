Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has asked the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria to explain why it remitted only N9bn out of about N75bn it generated between 2014 and 2019. The House asked the FAAN to remit the N66bn to the Federal Government coffers within two weeks if it could not account for the non-remittance. The management of the FAAN had appeared before the House Committee on Finance in Abuja on Tuesday to account for its revenues and remittances. The committee, however, noted irregularities in the figures presented by the FAAN. They also did not tally with those in the records of the offices of the Accountant-General of the Federation and the Auditor-General of the Federation. Copyright PUNCH.
