Raphael Ede, Enugu A non-governmental organisation, Women Aid Collective, on Friday, alleged that operatives of the Enugu State Police Command invaded its office at Nkpologu in Emene area of the state over a rape case the NGO was handling. The founder of the organisation and Dean, Faculty of Law, University of Nigeria, Prof. Joy Ezeilo, who stated this in a telephone interview with City Round, said the invasion was carried out by policemen from Abakpa Nike Area Command on Thursday. Ezeilo, who is currently a United Nations Ambassador, described the action of the police as barbaric, uncivilised and condemnable. She said, “The police invaded our office looking for a victim of a rape case. I don’t know why a victim that gave them an address will be looked for at WACOL office. “They raided our office in search of a rape complainant that we reported the case and rather than look into the case of the victim, they are more concerned about the rapist and his family that are influential and doing everything to stop the case.’’ The state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP, Ndukwe Daniel, confirmed the incident. He said, “The command is aware of the matter and currently investigating what happened. The command is looking at all angles to ascertain what exactly happened to take the necessary action.” Copyright PUNCH.
