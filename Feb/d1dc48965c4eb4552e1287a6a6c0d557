Germany, on Wednesday, announced new migration law for Nigerians, noting that the new regulation was imperative to address issues surrounding irregular migration. Minister of State of German Federal Chancellery, Mrs Annette Widmann-Mauz, made this known in Abuja in a meeting with the Federal Commissioner for Refugees, Migrants and IDPs, Mr Basheer Mohammed. Widmann-Mauz, who spoke through an interpreter, said, “We have to inform people before they leave their country of origin, in this case, Nigeria; to inform them about the legal regular pact of migration, especially over our Skills Migration Act. “We want to make very clear conditions are set by the new law and we will like to support them in fulfilling these criteria. “We will like to give advice and inform, but more than that, we will also like to offer language courses and training.

On his part, Mohammed commended the German government for the partnership, saying it would enhance efforts by the Nigerian government to tackle migration issues. “This migration policy of the commission is working at a high level; this success can be attributed to President Muhammadu Buhari’s commitment to tackling the issue of migration. “This engagement has been a success and I am sure it will yield the right result, especially towards addressing the issue of regular and irregular migration,” he said.
