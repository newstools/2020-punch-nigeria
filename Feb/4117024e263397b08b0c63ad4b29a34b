Adeniyi Olugbemi, Sokoto The Sultan of Sokoto,  Sa’ad Abubakar, has advocated more roles for traditional institutions in the fight against insecurity in the country. Sultan Abubakar wants the old time tradition restored where traditional institutions played critical roles in the security, administration and management of their community affairs, which brought about peaceful coexistence that guaranteed growth and development. He made the call in his address when he hosted Yoruba northern traditional rulers that visited him in his palace in Sokoto. He stressed the need for respect and understating for one another in a multi-ethnic and religious society like Nigeria. He said, “This visit of the northern Yoruba traditional rulers across the northern states is a strong message to divisive agents that are bent on setting the people of Nigeria against one another, that the unity of Nigeria has come to stay. “Traditional rulers should be empowered as it was in the past to manage their community in order to guide against security threat that has become a thing of concern to Nigeria as a nation.” Earlier, Oba Yusuf Hassan, the Sarkin Yoruba Maiduguri, who is also Chairman, Yoruba Northern Traditional Rulers had applauded Sultan Abubakar for his fatherly role in sustaining peaceful coexistence among Nigerians.
