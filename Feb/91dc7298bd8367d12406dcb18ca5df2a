Paris Saint-Germain have been dealt a big blow after manager Thomas Tuchel revealed Neymar will remain sidelined for Sunday’s meeting with Lyon. Neymar, 28, missed Tuesday’s 2-1 win away to Nantes because of a rib injury suffered during the 5-0 win over Montpellier. Tuchel told reporters on Friday the Brazilian would be one of several first-team regulars set to miss the Ligue 1 visit of Lyon. It’s unknown when the Selecao star can return to action. Tuchel will hope to have him back for the UEFA Champions League last-16 visit to Borussia Dortmund on February 18. The forward has suffered numerous injuries since joining PSG from Barcelona for £200 million in 2017, most recently missing six weeks with a hamstring injury he suffered while on international duty with Brazil late last year. PSG have supreme attacking depth, and Tuchel can still call on the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Edinson Cavani, Mauro Icardi, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, Pablo Sarabia and Julian Draxler. However, Neymar will be a big loss. He offers incredible flair and creativity going forward, which few defences in the world can handle. And his return of 47 goals and 27 assists in 51 Ligue 1 appearances is an indication of how consistently he contributes when he is fit and in form. Neymar had enjoyed a brilliant vein of form recently, scoring in seven consecutive league matches in December and January, so Tuchel will be eagerly awaiting his return.
