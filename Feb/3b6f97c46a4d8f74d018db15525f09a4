Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The senator representing Anambra South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Ifeanyi Ubah, has accused a politician, Obinna Uzoh, of forgery. Ubah, in a statement by his media office, said Uzoh allegedly resorted to misleading the judiciary by “parading photoshopped NECO results and sponsoring unsubstantiated propaganda” against him. According to the senator, Uzoh initially alleged that Ubah forged his NECO results “because his certificate has seven credits without one fail (F9) in Biology, which is clearly contained in the statement of result.” It added that the man had allegedly altered the serial numbers of his NECO certificate to deceive members of the public. The statement read, “This vividly shows that Obinna Uzoh and his cronies are not in tune with the conventional practices of examination bodies; NECO in this case, and WAEC also. Recent events have further unveiled the fact that he does not know the difference between a ‘Statement of Result and ‘certificate.’ “It is also crystal clear that Obinna Uzoh does not know that INEC requires candidates to submit only ‘certificate’ and not ‘Statement of Result.’ It is a well-known fact that Obinna Uzoh and the claimant, Anani Cletus, through their lawyer swore to an affidavit before the court stating that the missing F9 was the basis of their allegation.” Copyright PUNCH.
