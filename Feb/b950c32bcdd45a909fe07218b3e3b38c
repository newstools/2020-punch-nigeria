Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The Ogun State Government says it will soon begin to revive some of its major old towns by giving such places a facelift. The state government noted that this was in a bid to make a change in the landscape to meet international standards and also make such places investment-friendly. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Olatunji Odunlami, said the need to ensure proper and regulated urban renewal in the state necessitated the unbundling of the Urban and Regional Planning Board to align with the core objectives and competencies of the ministry. He noted that the establishment was to further drive socio-economic development across the state by creating avenue for ease of doing business as well as boosting internally generated revenue in the state. Defining each agency’s role, Odunlami stated that Ogun State Slum Regeneration Authority was established to focus on the old big towns that were abandoned in terms of proper planning and development. According to him, it is part of the State Governor, Dapo Abiodun’s agenda not to only focus on cities but to also ensure that all old towns are properly planned and developed for aesthetic values and to attract investments.
