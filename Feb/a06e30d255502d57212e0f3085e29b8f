Adelani Adepegba, Abuja Two Nigerians, Adams John and Victor Obialu, stranded in Kenya as a result of irregular migration and visa overstay have arrived in Abuja. Their return on Friday was facilitated by the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission. The young men were received by the NIDCOM Chairman, Abike Dabiri-Erewa. John travelled to Kenya in 2017 and was arrested for visa overstay which earned him a six-month imprisonment while Obialu was also imprisoned for passport and visa irregularities. A statement by NIDCOM spokesman, Abdul- Rahman Balogun, said Dabiri-Erewa stressed that irregular migration and improper documentation should be discouraged and avoided. She urged Nigerians to be of good conduct whenever and wherever they found themselves by obeying the laws of their host country. She offered a special appreciation to Kaduna State Government for the swift response on the matter, as well as the Nigerian Mission in Kenya. “However, anyone who commits a crime will face the penalty “, She said. Meanwhile, John and Obialu said they were happy to be back home. “All our prayers was that we came back home. The stress we went through is not worth it. My advice to all Nigerians is to be cautious of all the laws”, they said. Copyright PUNCH.
