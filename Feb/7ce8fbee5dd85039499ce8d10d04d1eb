Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The poor electrical installation and construction practices in the distribution sub-sector of the power industry is alarming, the Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency declared on Tuesday. NEMSA is an agency of the Federal Government with the mandate to ensure efficient, stable, safe and reliable networks for electricity supply nationwide. To address the challenge of poor installations and construction practices, the agency also unveiled the Nigerian Electrical Installations and Construction Guidelines Manual for the distribution sub-sector in the power industry. It explained that “with the advent of the privatisation of the electricity distribution sub-sector and the emergence of different owners of the Discos, divergent construction standards and practices have become very alarming.” The Managing Director, NEMSA, Peter Ewesor, said it was therefore paramount to harmonise specifications, standards and designs in order to arrest the proliferation of different network designs and construction practices. The Minister of State for Power, Goddy Judy-Agba, who unveiled the manual in Abuja, declared that with the introduction of the manual, it now behooved on power distribution companies to abide by the guidelines in the book.
