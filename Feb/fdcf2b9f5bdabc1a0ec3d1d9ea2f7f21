Ebenezer Bajela Bosnia and Herzegovina Premier League club, FK Zvijezda 09, have announced on their official website that they have completed the signing of Nigeria international, Ejike Uzoenyi. The winger, who has been without a club since he left Ajax Cape Town in 2018, has put pen to paper on a contract until May 2021.

Uzoenyiâ€™s other clubs include Enyimba, Rennes, Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits. The player could make his competitive debut for FK Zvijezda 09 in the league game against Zeljeznicar on Saturday (today). Copyright PUNCH.
