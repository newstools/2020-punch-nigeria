Godwin ISENYO, Kaduna. The Kaduna Police Command has confirmed the killing of Dr. Philip Ataga’s wife, kidnapped last week by bandits. The Police Public Relations Officer of the Command, DSP Yakubu Sabo, told our correspondent on the telephone that the command received the report today(Saturday)and had recovered the corpse. “We got the report from our investigative team today(Saturday) and the Anti-kidnapping Squad of the Command has gone to recover the corpse. “When they(kidnappers) dumped the body, the command got the information to recover the body and deposited it at the Gwamna Awwan General Hospital, Kakuri,” the spokesman said. The wife of the Kaduna-based medical doctor was kidnapped along with her two children by the bandits suspected to be kidnappers at the Juji Community in Chikun Local Government Area of the state. The bandits also killed a vigilante during the operation. The kidnappers were said to have invaded the community about 10pm Friday, January 24, 2020. The Juji community had suffered a series of kidnapping in recent times. Meanwhile, a source told one of our correspondents on Saturday that the bandits initially demanded a ransom of N120m to release the woman and her two children. He said that the gunmen later killed the woman while her husband was looking for how to raise the ransom demanded by them. “How on earth did these people(kidnappers) want the man to raise such a huge amount of money. Even if the man sells all his property, will he realised the money? These people are simply senseless. “What we are hearing now is that they have killed the woman and now demanding some money before the could set the two children free,” he said. When asked of the amount(ransom) involved, the source said, “We heard N20m.”
