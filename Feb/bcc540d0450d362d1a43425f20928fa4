Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo The leadership of the All Progressive Congress in Taraba State has threatened to explore legal options that will compel the Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, to return to the state if the House of Assembly fails to comply with the necessary constitutional provisions. The state Chairman of the party, Mr. Ibrahim El-Sudi; and the APC governorship candidate in the 2019 elections, Prof. Muhammad Yahaya, said this at a press conference they jointly addressed, in Jalingo, on Thursday. They alleged that Ishaku had been out of the state for over 54 days without transmitting power to his deputy, Haruna Manu. El-Sudi said, “The governor has failed to do the needful and he has been out of the state for 54 days now. The House has also failed to invoke the necessary constitutional provisions. We therefore, call on the house to urgently do this in the interest of the state.” They threatened to seek legal redress should the assembly fail to do the needful. Copyright PUNCH.
