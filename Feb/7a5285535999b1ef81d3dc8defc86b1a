Peter Dada, Akure A member of the House of Representatives from Ondo State, Mr Bunmi Tunji-Ojo, has said that the power station that got burnt at Oke Agbe, the headquarters of Akoko North West Local Government Area of Ondo State, will soon be made functional. The multibillion naira Federal Government power station was gutted few weeks ago, destroying many of its components. The federal lawmaker said necessary steps would be taken to ensure the burnt station was rebuilt. The lawmaker representing the Akoko North East/North West Federal Constituency gave the assurance while speaking with journalists. He said he was determined to develop his constituency and the entire Ondo State. It was gathered that the power station was built to supply electricity to the Akoko area of Ondo State and some parts of Ekiti State “We would contact and lobby the concerned MDAs (Ministry Departments and Agencies of the FG)  to rebuild it because it is meant to supply power to Ondo North Senatorial District and some parts of Ekiti and Kogi states.” The lawmaker was said to have presented a 500KVA transformer earlier to Ilepa community in Ikare Akoko, which has experienced a blackout for over three years. “It is part of the campaign promise to the community. As promised, we will keep delivering effective representation. For me, politics is about bringing dividends of democracy to the people,” the lawmaker noted. Tunji-Ojo, who is the Chairman, House Committee on Niger Delta Development Commission, said apart from solving the problem of electricity in the area, he had a plan to empower youths and women in the federal constituency with vocational skills to enable them to be self-reliant.
