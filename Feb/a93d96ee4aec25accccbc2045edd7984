Femi Makinde Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said Nigeria needs to address the matter of restructuring now. He said failure to do this might lead to grave consequences. Obasanjo spoke in Lagos on Saturday at the first memorial lecture of the founder of Oodua People’s Congress, Dr Fredrick Fasehun. Obasanjo lamented the increasing rate of insecurity in the country, saying Boko Haram had continued to wax stronger over 12 years.
He said Nigeria could not afford to be plunged into another war at this time because such might not be easy to win. He said, “When I was elected President the agitation was true federalism but now it is restructuring. “If we don’t address it they may go from restructuring to self-determination and this will be a serious problem. “If Boko Haram can get external support, any group that decided to go will get support from within and outside. So we must address the issue now.” The language we are using to address ourselves across the region now is uncouth and it must not continue “I will continue to fight for Nigeria’s unity until I die. But this fight is not to make my children and my race second class citizens. “Ti owo o ba se san a ka leri ( If you can no longer swing your hand, then you put it on your head),” he said.
