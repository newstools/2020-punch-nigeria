Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The police on Friday arraigned five men arrested for armed robbery which took place at the Mpape, Abuja branch of First Bank on December 28, 2019. They were arraigned before Justice Ajoke Adepoju of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in Wuse Zone 2, Abuja. The defendants–Ehizo Larry, Princewill Obinna, Elijah David, Timothy Joe, and Ernest Ewin–pleaded not guilty to the five counts read to them. They were charged with armed robbery, attempted armed robbery and illegal possession of firearms. After they took their pleas, the prosecuting counsel, James Idachaba, urged the court to remand them in prison and requested that his team be given one week to present its case. He said the prosecution had listed seven witnesses and would tender vital exhibits. “Our case is easy because the defendants were caught in the act,” Idachaba said. Defence lawyers who represented Larry, an employee of the bank, Obinna, and Ewin, did not oppose the application for the remand of their clients in prison. But the defence lawyers, Peter Ihunweze – representing Larry and Ewin – and Anenin Ebabosi, representing Obinna, informed the court that they would file an application for their bail. The third and fourth defendants, David and Joe, were not represented by any lawyer. The prosecuting counsel promised the judge that he would contact the Legal Aid Council to provide legal representation for the two defendants if they were unable to procure the services of a lawyer by the next hearing date. The judge then ordered their remand and fixed March 13, 2020 for trial. Copyright PUNCH.
