Tunde Oyekola, IIorin Property estimated at millions of naira was on Friday destroyed by fire which razed about 12 shops along a railway station at Post Office, Ilorin, Kwara State. It was gathered that the quick intervention of the state fire service saved the MRS Petrol Station and about 180 adjoining shops located within the vicinity of the incident. The state Director of Fire Service, Alhaji Iyanda Yakub, attributed the fire to electric spark from high power voltage. Items destroyed by the inferno included textiles, bags, shoes, and children wear. One of the affected traders, Ihejirika Osita, who narrated his ordeal, said he was woken up around 1am by a call from a neighbour who informed him of the incident. He said, “One of our neighbours called me around 1am to tell me about the fire. At first, I didn’t know I could be involved but on getting there, I saw all my items burnt to ashes. “I just borrowed N1m to restock my shop but see (pointing to the wreckage) all my items had burnt down. I am married with a kid. Where do I start from? I want government to please come to our aid.” Yakub urged the public to be safety conscious and always switch off all electrical appliances while leaving homes and shops to prevent fire outbreak. He also disclosed the readiness of the state fire service to sensitise all relevant organisations across the state to fire safety and preventive measures. Copyright PUNCH.
