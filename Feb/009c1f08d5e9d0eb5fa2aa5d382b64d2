Kelvin Ekerete Nigeria striker, Paul Onuachu, has hailed the travelling fans after their 1-1 draw at Royal Antwerp in the Belgian Pro league on Thursday. Onuachu opened the scoring for the visitors in the 12th minute, his eighth league goal of the ongoing campaign in 19 games before the hosts got their equaliser from a Joakim Maehle own goal in the 39th minute. Speaking after the game, Onuachu says the players gave a good account of themselves in such a difficult terrain. “It was a difficult game, a very good fight from the boys. The traveling fans were amazing,” he wrote on Instagram. The Nigeria international made way for his countryman, Stephen Odey, in the 90th minute of the match. Onuachu has been one of Genk’s top players this season and has been saddled with the task of leading the frontline after the departure of Tanzanian striker, Mbwana Samatta during the January transfer window.
