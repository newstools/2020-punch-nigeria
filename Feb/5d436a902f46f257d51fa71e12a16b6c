Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa A Nigerian Air Force jet on Sunday landed at the Bayelsa International Airport about one year after the inaugural flight to the airport. The NAF jet landed at 4pm and took off at about 4.50pm, the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Daniel Iworiso-Markson, said in a statement on Sunday. It quoted the Air Officer Commanding, Mobility Command, Yenagoa, Air Vice Marshal Ibukun Ojeyemi, as saying that the jet was on a survey mission. This is coming 12 days after Ojeyemi stated, during a courtesy visit to Governor Seriake Dickson, that NAF would put the airport to use pending the issuance of the civil aviation licence for the commencement of commercial flight operation at the facility. Ojeyemi said with the quality of the airport and state-of-the-art facilities, the people should expect more NAF jets landing on the airport. “The naval chief described the landing and take-off of the NAF jet as smooth and impressive as it was witnessed by some officers and men of the command and other civilians, amidst excitement,” the statement read.
