Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly, Collins Chiji, has faulted the allegation by the Peoples Democratic Party that the lawmakers in the state who defected to the All Progressives Congress from the PDP, Action Alliance and the All Progressive Grand Alliance were given N50m and a plot of land each. The speaker, who spoke to journalists in Owerri, said “There is no iota of truth in the speculation that we were financially induced to join APC. The personality of the governor informed our decision. The governor is a good man. Our love for our state made us to join APC” Copyright PUNCH.
