Johnny Edward Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa, extended his goal drought in the Saudi Arabian Premier League to 22 game after he fired blanks in Thursday’s league clash against Al Fateh FC in the Saudi Arabian Premier League, Sports Extra reports. The game ended 1-1 with Ali Al-Hassan earning a share of the spoils for Al Fateh FC in the 70th minute, after Abderrazak Hamdallah had shot Al Nassr ahead eight minutes earlier. Musa played the entire duration of the game – his 15th of the season. The 27-year-old’s last goal for Al Nassr in the Saudi Arabian topflight dates back to April 18, 2019, when he netted a brace in his club’s 5-0 thrashing of Al Fateh. Ever since then, Musa has failed to score in 11 league appearances this season, but has netted twice and provided four assists in the King Cup of Champions competition. Copyright PUNCH.
