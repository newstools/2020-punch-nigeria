Our Correspondents The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency says it has inaugurated its newly installed Category 3 Instrument Landing System at Runway 18 Right of Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos and Runway 22 at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. The agency also stated on Sunday that a flight commissioning of the newly installed Doppler Very High Frequency Omni-Directional Radio Range in Lagos had successfully been carried out. It added that a routine flight calibration had also been carried out on Runway 18 Left in Lagos. The Managing Director of NAMA, Capt. Fola Akinkuotu, said a notice to airmen had been disseminated accordingly. According to him, calibration of navigational aids in other locations across the country is in progress to ensure all navigational aids in Nigeria that are due for calibration are covered. “In spite of initial hitches, it is gratifying to note that Runway 18R in Lagos has been certified for CAT 3 just as Runway 22 in Abuja with the newly acquired calibration aircraft by the aviation ministry. Both facilities are now fully operational,” Akinkuotu said. It would be recalled that several domestic and international flights were delayed or cancelled about a fortnight ago due to poor weather and faulty equipment at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. While pledging a timely calibration of navigational facilities going forward, Akinkuotu said the availability of flight calibration aircraft would ensure that NAMA would be able to carry out calibration as and when due.
