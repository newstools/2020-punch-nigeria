Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese, Mathew Kukah, on Tuesday, in Kaduna, expressed displeasure with the alleged poor management of Nigeria. The Bishop stated this in his homily at the Good Shepherd Major Seminary, Kaukau, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State before the burial of the seminarian killed by kidnappers in the state. He lamented that citizens of some countries were willing to risk their lives for their nations but such is not the case in Nigeria. He alleged that officeholders were loyal to their positions and not the country. He said, “Nigeria is at a point where we must call for a verdict. There must be something that a man, nay, a nation should be ready to die for. “Sadly, or even tragically, today, Nigeria, does not possess that set of goals or values for which any sane citizen is prepared to die for her.

We have practised madness for too long. “Our attempt to build a nation has become like the agony of Sisyphus who angered the gods and had to endure the frustration of rolling a stone up the mountain. Each time he got near the top, the gods would tip the stone back and he would go back to start all over again. What has befallen our nation?”
