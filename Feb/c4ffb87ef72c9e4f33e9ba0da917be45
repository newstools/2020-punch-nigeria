Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja The Minister of State for Works and Housing, Abubakar Aliyu, has told Dantata & Sawoe, the contractor handling the rehabilitation work on Kano-Shuwarin section of Kano- Maiduguri road project, to speed up work so as to deliver the job on target. Aliyu gave the charge while on an inspection visit to assess the progress of the ongoing work. The minister, according to a statement on Monday, called for the project to be delivered on time due to the accident being recorded on the road as a result of the bad portion between Wudil and Gaya. Aliyu, who showed disappointment with the level of work by the contractors in two months from his last visit in December, urged the contractor to double up effort to meet the target. Copyright PUNCH.
