The Federal Road Safety Corps in Niger State said six people died in an accident on Thursday on the outskirts of Lambata-Lapai Road of Gurara Local Government Area of the state. The FRSC Sector Commander in the state, Mr Joel Dagwa, told the News Agency of Nigeria on Friday in Minna that the accident involved a Daf trailer heading for Kano from Lagos State. Dagwa said the truck en route from Lagos was already loaded with goods but still accommodated the passengers. “The accident involved 57 people – 54 males, two male children and one female child. Six of them were killed while 35 sustained injuries and were taken to the Federal Medical Centre, Gawu-Babangida. “All the six corpses have been deposited at Sabon Wuse general hospital’s morgue,” he said, blaming the accident on overloading. The sector commander said that the corps would continue to monitor road users to guard against overloading and dangerous driving. “We will sustain our ongoing aggressive patrols across all major highways to ensure that road users adhere strictly to traffic rules and regulations to avoid road accidents,” he said.
