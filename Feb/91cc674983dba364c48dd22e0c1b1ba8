Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna A group, the Northern Coalition for Peace and Development, has asked the Federal Government to initiate talks with bandits towards ending banditry and other crimes across the country. The group’s National Secretary, Alhaji Attahiru Adamu, also said at a press conference held in Kaduna on Tuesday that the clamour for the sack of the nation’s service chiefs was unnecessary and would be counterproductive in the fight against insurgency. He asked the Federal Government to emulate the governments of Zamfara, Katsina and Sokoto states that doused tension in the state by holding talks with bandits. He said, “We commend the efforts of governor of Zamfara, Sokoto and Katsina states, particularly over their role in achieving effective resolutions by way of reconciliation and peace accord with bandits so as to remedy the issue of security challenges confronting their states.” On the service chiefs, he said, “Majority of those calling for the sack of service chiefs are not sincere as they fail to offer reasonable alternative before now to Mr President on how to tackle issues of security. “Politicising the issue of national security by some group of do-no good among our political elite is much dangerous and poses a serious threat and concern to the challenges facing our dear country today. “There is an urgent need for all Nigerians to unite and support the efforts of both the federal and state governments towards fighting crimes such as insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery, among others.” Copyright PUNCH.
