Johnny Edward Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo hopes Watford can put Sunday’s 3-0 loss to the Red Devils behind them and avoid relegation at the end of the season, Sports Extra reports. Watford currently occupy the 19th position with 24 points from 27 games. And with 11 games left to play, Ighalo urged the Hornets to keep fighting to retain their status in the Premier League. “My wish is for them to keep fighting to remain in the Premier League because I know they have a good team, they are good people, it’s a family club and they have a good owner and I just wish them all the very best to remain in the Premier League,” Ighalo told Watford Observer. The 30-year-old also described the moment Watford fans sang his name at the end of Sunday’s match at Old Trafford as “special.” The Nigerian scored 40 goals in 100 appearances for the Hornets before departing for Changchun Yatai in 2017.
