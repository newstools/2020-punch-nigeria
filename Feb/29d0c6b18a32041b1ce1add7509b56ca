Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has vowed to recover the over N200bn paid as premium to insurance companies by the Federal Government for a non-existent Head of Service Group Life Insurance Scheme between 2014 and 2019. The House Committee on Insurance and Actuarial Matters expressed regret that despite the humongous amount of public fund sunk into the project, there was nothing to show for it. The House had on December 12, 2019, resolved to investigate Federal Government ministries, departments and agencies for alleged fraud in their insurance policies. The House had mandated the Committee on Insurance and Actuarial Matters to “conduct an investigative hearing involving all relevant stakeholders to identify any breaches and ascertain the veracity of the suspected infractions by the aforementioned institutions.” Chairman of the committee, Mr Darlington Nwokeocha, who spoke to journalists, said, “This investigation is as a result of the petitions of over 2000 persons across Nigeria who felt that there were suspected breaches and infractions against Insurance Act provisions. “We have been able to unravel certain facts, though the committee has not concluded its investigations; but to the extent we have heard from the insurance companies that did business with the Head of Service of the Federation and some other institutions of the government, it is becoming very clear that the laws guiding insurance practice in Nigeria are not being obeyed.” Copyright PUNCH.
