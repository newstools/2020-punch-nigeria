Afeez Hanafi A truck killed a woman and left two others with varying degrees of injury on Saturday at the Ojota area of Lagos State. The driver reportedly lost control of the truck while speeding which resulted in the crash. The truck was said to have fallen with two containers attached to it, trapping the victims in the process. It was learnt that the woman died on the spot while the two others were extricated by emergency officials and rushed to the Accident and Trauma Centre at Tollgate. The General Manager, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Dr Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, said the corpse of the yet-to-be identified woman had been deposited in a morgue. He said, “A Mack truck loaded with two containers with an unknown number plate lost control while driving on top speed. It subsequently fell on its side and trapped three persons in the truck. “The LASEMA responders sprung into action by extricating the victims with the aid of light rescue equipment. Two adult males were rescued, while an adult female, unfortunately, lost her life. “The two casualties were taken to the nearest trauma centre for medical care, while the remains of the deceased were transported to the nearby morgue. “The containers are presently being recovered by the Agency’s goliath, while other agencies managed the resultant gridlock.” Also, a tanker loaded with diesel fell and spilled its contents on Saturday around 9pm at China Town, Ojota, resulting in traffic. Osanyintolu, who confirmed the incident, said residents had been warned not to move close to the scene and avoid anything that could spark off a fire. Copyright PUNCH.
