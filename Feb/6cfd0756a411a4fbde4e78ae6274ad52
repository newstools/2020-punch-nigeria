Lara Adejoro A man who was quarantined at the Isolation Unit of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, has been transferred to the General Ward of the tertiary hospital. Our correspondent had spotted the patient inside the Isolation Unit of the state-owned hospital on Friday. The isolation unit is located within the Medical Emergency unit of the facility. It was also observed that the medical personnel on duty at the unit and other health workers wore personal protective equipment, while patients and visitors were screened before they gained entrance into the Medical Emergency unit. Speaking with our correspondent on Friday over the issue, LASUTH’s Director of Clinical Services and Training, Dr Ibrahim Mustafa, said the quarantined patient was accompanied to the hospital by a family member in the early hours of Friday. “It was a case of wrong suspicion. The patient only presented with fever, upper respiratory tract infection and skin rash which was not pronounced. “There hasn’t been any history of contact with anybody with Lassa fever or coronavirus. “The fact that the patient has fever and people are on high panic mode now, so people tend to think any fever is either coronavirus or Lassa fever,” Mustafa said. He said the patient was transferred to the General Ward “because there is no clear-cut indication, besides fever and upper respiratory tract infection. Copyright PUNCH.
