Investors pulled nearly $3.3bn out of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold United States stocks last week, snapping the longest streak of asset gains since July, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute. As reported by Reuters, the pullback from the US equity market came during a week in which companies such as Apple Inc said the coronavirus outbreak, now known as covid-19, will likely affect its quarterly results and could weigh on its supply chain. Concerns about the global economic impact of the virus helped push the benchmark S&P 500 down nearly 7.3 per cent since Feb 19, according to Refinitiv data. The index is now down nearly three per cent since the start of the year. For the year to date, investors have pulled $26.7bn from funds that invest in US stocks. Fixed income funds garnered nearly $14.9bn in new assets, continuing a winning streak that has pulled in nearly $119bn into the category since the start of the year. World stock funds, meanwhile, added slightly more than $3.5bn in new assets, continuing a winning streak that began in mid-December.  Â­
