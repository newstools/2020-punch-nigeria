Tony Okafor, Awka Anambra State workers on Monday threatened an industrial action against the state government over new minimum wage. The workers expressed disappointment that after the state governor, Willie Obiano, promised to pay the new wage in January, it was not reflected in their salary as agreed. The Nigeria Labour Congress, Anambra State chapter, at a press conference in Awka on Monday gave the  governor a 14-day ultimatum to address the issue of the approved minimum wage or face industrial action. The decision was taken  after an emergency meeting of  the labour leaders  in the state, led by the NLC Chairman, Jerry Nnubia Others at the meeting included the Chairman Joint Negotiating Council,  Benson Jibike; TUC Chairman, Ifeanyi Okechukwu; acting Sec/Sec ASCSN, Alex Ebi; and Secretary NULGE, Segun Netufo. The communique issued at the end of the meeting  frowned at the decision by the government of Anambra State not to pay the new wage. The communique read in part “Consequent upon this, the organised Labour hereby gives the Anambra State government 14 days ultimatum with effect from Tuesday, February 4, 2020, to implement the agreement on the new minimum  wage reached with the organised labour.” “If at the end of this Ultimatum, the government fails to properly implement the new minimum wage as agreed between the government and labour, the organised labour in Anambra State may no longer guarantee the industrial peace presently existing in the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
