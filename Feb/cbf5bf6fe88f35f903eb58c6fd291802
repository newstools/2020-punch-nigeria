A driver, George Augustine, on Friday appeared in a Badagry Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos State for allegedly driving recklessly and causing the death of two customs officers on duty. The police charged Augustine with three counts of manslaughter, reckless driving and driving without a driving licence. He, however, pleaded not guilty. The Prosecution Counsel, ASP Ikem Ukor, said the defendant committed the offence on July 14, 2018 at about 9.30 am at Gbaji Village on Seme Badagry expressway, Lagos.
