Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The senator representing Kogi West, Smart Adeyemi, has said the support of his constituents for Governor Yahyah Bello was total, non-negotiable and unconditional. Adeyemi was speaking on Saturday while playing host to various groups and individual dignitaries who paid him a courtesy visit. He said, “There is no need to form any alternative structure as the GYB structure is our structure and a sure structure for all ardent believers of the “Let’s do more” agenda. The forum provided an opportunity to review some past events such as the Kogi governorship and Kogi West senatorial elections won by the All Progressives Congress and the prompt take-off of the new administration coded “Let’s do more.” Copyright PUNCH.
