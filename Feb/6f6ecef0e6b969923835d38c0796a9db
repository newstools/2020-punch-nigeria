Latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that the volume and value of mCash payments had been on a steady rise since it was relaunched in August 2018 by telecom operators and 16 Nigerian banks. The volume of payments also totalled 218,132 within the same period under review. mCash is an unstructured supplementary service data-based service that helps small business owners to receive funds from their low-income customers using their mobile devices. The cashless initiative, first launched in 2016, is one of the numerous ways merchants receive payments, with others such as NIP, Point of Sales and ATM, recording more usage in terms of volume and value of transactions. In October 2018, a total of 18,326 deals worth N59.23m were recorded on the mCash platform. In the following month, the volume of transactions rose to 19,528, amounting to N54.18m. In December 2018, 21,001 mCash payments worth N67.24m were achieved by retailers in the country. Last year January, the volume of transactions on the mCash platform dipped to 17,574 and reduced to N54.31m. In February 2019, the volume of mCash payments rose to 19,009 and a value of N61.72m was recorded. In March, the deals improved, recording 22,121 mCash payments worth N67.41m. April saw retailers carrying out 21,123 deals valued at N66.02m; May’s volume rose to 23,859, with a value of N87.15m. Transactions worth N44.23m with a volume of 15,511 deals were recorded in June. The NBS data stated that from July to September 2019, a total of 40,080 deals valued at N88bn were conducted by retailers all over the country. During the relaunch of the mCash initiative in Lagos, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, NIBSS, Mr Adebisi Shonubi, said that idea was created out of the need to enhance financial inclusion in Nigeria by extending e-payment benefits to payers and merchants operating at the local level, especially the small and medium-scale business owners. “The intention is to expand the payment opportunity for people who still use cash today to find a more convenient means of making payments. “To ensure the paradigm shift, we had to promote an ecosystem partnership consisting of banks and telecommunication companies, thereby birthing what has become a novel collaboration anywhere in the world – a service that is not one bank or one telco-driven but which is ecosystem-driven,” Shonubi said.
