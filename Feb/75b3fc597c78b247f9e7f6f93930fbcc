Umar Muhammed, Lafia Police operatives are presently combing forests and hideouts in the Shabu area of Lafia, Nasarawa State, as parts of efforts to rescue the abducted Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Works, Mr Jibril Giza. The state Commissioner of Police, Mr Bola Longe, stated this on Sunday, noting that his deputies and the Divisional Police Officer in the area “were combing the bushes in a rescue operation of the permanent secretary.” Also reacting, the Commissioner of Information, Culture and Tourism, Mr Dogo Shama, reiterated the state government’s commitment to ensure that the permanent secretary regained freedom from his captors. Our correspondent, who visited the residence of the kidnapped permanent secretary in Shabu, observed the influx of sympathisers and well-wishers, who thronged the place. Meanwhile, a member of the family has said the abductors have yet to establish contact with the family. This was disclosed by the nephew of the victim, Mr Suleiman Bashir, in an interview with Northern City News at the residence of the permanent secretary. According to him, the kidnappers came to the house on “motorcycles and scaled the fence, after which they took the permanent secretary to an unknown destination.” He said the abductors declined an undisclosed amount of money the victim offered them for his release.
