ABIODUN NEJO Fire gutted bags of seized Indian hemp heaped at the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency office in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, on Saturday. The incident caused panic at the NDLEA office located along Akinsola Street, Olorunsogo Quarters, off Iworokoro Road and efforts were made to put out the fire. Though nobody could state the cause of the fire, officers of the agency were surprised at the incident as they made efforts to put it out. Sources said the smokes which billowed from the place and the disturbing smell of Indian hemp drew residentsâ€™ attention to the fire. The sources added that the residents were the people who assisted the NDLEA command office with water to put the fire under control before men of the Ekiti Fire Service got to the scene and quenched it. Residents lamented that the thick smoke and smell of the hemp which fouled the air from the NDLEA office was unpleasant. However, the NDLEA Public Relations Officer for Ekiti State Command, Mr Peter Njokwu, said he had not been briefed about the incident. Copyright PUNCH.
