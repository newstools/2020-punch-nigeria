Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja A state High Court sitting in Lokoja, Kogi State, has ruled that the Peoples Democratic Party had no candidate in the November 16 governorship election in the state. In a ruling on Thursday, Justice John Olorunfemi, declared that the primary conducted on  September 3, 2019, which produced Musa Wada as the candidate of the PDP, was fraught with irregularities such as an hour-long downpour and sporadic gunshots, which led to delegates scampering for safety, and could not be said to be fair enough to produce a candidate. The ruling was in a pre-election matter filed by Abubakar Idris, the eldest son of a former governor of the state, Ibrahim Idris, challenging the candidature of Wada as the party’s candidate in the governorship election. According to Abubakar, neither the claimant nor the defendant, Wada, could lay claim to be the authentic candidate of the PDP since the primary was inconclusive. Justice Olorunfemi further submitted that the second defendant could not convince the court that he actually won the party primary, which was marred with rancour and acrimony, arising from pandemonium, due to sporadic gunshots that compelled the participants to scamper for safety.
