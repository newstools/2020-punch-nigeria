Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo No fewer than 120 youths from Ede Federal Constituency in Osun State will get a grant of N10m in two years to start business. The beneficiaries would be selected out of 720 participants in a business boot camp organised by the lawmaker representing Ede Federal Constituency of the state, Bamidele Salam. A statement by his media office on Saturday quoted Salam as demanding action from the government to support youth and get them involved in initiatives that would lead to establishment of more Small and Medium Scale Enterprises. Salam added that through innovations of the vast youthful populace, the country would be able to cater to the needs of its people and even create employment. He explained that the boot camp was put together to re-orientate the youths on the need to turn to business rather than chase non-existent white collars jobs. According to him, over 130 million job seekers that were mainly youths were either seeking for jobs in the public or private sectors, even though the number of job opportunities available could not cope with the number. “We are trying to impart knowledge, knowledge is the foundation of success in business. We are going to enlighten them on how to run a business successfully. “The event is in batches for those who are business inclined. We opened an online portal for them where over 1,500 people registered and online test was done and we selected 720 participants who have been divided into three groups. “The next batch will start in April. After the camp, they will be handed over to a consulting firm for mentorship.” Copyright PUNCH.
