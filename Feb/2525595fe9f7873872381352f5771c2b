Seun Adesoye The immediate-past governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, said on Sunday that he left the Creek Haven Government House, Yenagoa, a fulfilled man. The former governor said this in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Fidelis Soriwei. He said he left Government House “in a blaze of glory” in spite of the political forces that turned against him despite the assistance he rendered to them. The former governor said when the election results were announced against the Peoples Democratic Party, there was no violence  in consonance with his politics without bitterness. However, Dickson lamented that alleged thugs of the All progressives Congress destroyed properties in Yenagoa, after the Supreme Court judgment. He said, “You are all in this state. You saw the reactions, and when the elections came, there was nothing possible I didn’t do as a human being for things to go well. People came here with the Nigerian military, shut down the whole state, and wrote results and used people to legitimise it. “As we lost there was no violence. I didn’t come into politics to kill people, to destroy or maim. “Since 2015 they have been killing our people, even without election. They will drive people away, burn down their houses; this country, since 2015, outsourced Bayelsa to criminals with security agencies supporting and protecting them. “I didn’t forget or abandon my agenda for my people while they were distracting me, blackmailing me everywhere, spreading falsehood. The people who should have been supporting and encouraging me were the same people distracting me, destabilising the state. “Yet I left Government House very fulfilled, to the glory of God.” Copyright PUNCH.
