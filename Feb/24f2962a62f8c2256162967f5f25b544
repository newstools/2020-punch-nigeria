Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The Lagos State Government has threatened to seal 105 estates across the state over layout approval. The state government said it had warned developers and investors in the built environment to desist from developing estates without obtaining layout approvals from the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development. In a public notice published in two national dailies, the state government said owners of the affected estates and others without approval should submit necessary documents to the office of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development within 21 days or their estates would be sealed. According to the notice, the 21 days began on February 17. In a statement signed by Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development, Mukaila Sanusi, the state government said the cautionary move was in furtherance of the quest for a functional, orderly, well-organised and resilient smart city and to check the proliferation of slums and the attendant environmental degradation. “Developers and owners of estates are urged to comply with the directive, which was made in accordance with relevant provisions of the Lagos State Government Notice No. 6 of 1983 on Guidelines for approval of layouts, otherwise estates that fail to comply will be sealed in accordance with the law,” the statement read in part. Estate developers and owners were also urged to desist from preventing officials of the ministry from performing their official duties. Copyright PUNCH.
