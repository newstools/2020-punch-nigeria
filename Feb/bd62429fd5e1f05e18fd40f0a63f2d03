Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Some community members in Iloro Ekiti in the Ijero Ekiti Local Government Area of Ekiti State on Monday protested against alleged attack by their monarch, the Oluloro of Iloro Ekiti, Oba Femi Olugbesoye. They claimed he sponsored thugs to beat up those opposed to his installation. The protesters, comprising men women and youths, marched round the town with traditional sticks called ‘apasa’, which they said was a taboo for any oba to see. They appealed to Governor Kayode Fayemi to review the monarch’s appointment and replace him with their preferred choice. The Aro of Iloro kingdom, Chief Samuel Agbaje, said, “Oba Olugbesoye is not the choice of the town, he was imposed on us. “There must be a review of his kingship. We believe the government will address the issue properly, but if it fails, we will go to court.” Agbaje alleged that those opposed to the monarch were being attacked by agents of the king. The Sajowa of Iloro Ekiti, Chief Olusegun Ogundele, corroborated Agbaje. But Oba Olugbesoye described activities of the protesters as “senseless blackmail.” The monarch said, “It is the turn of my dynasty to fill the vacant stool left by the departed Oluloro. “Others who contested against me had embraced my kingship. But these ones have been doing all manners of abominable things and I appeal to them to work for the peace of the town.” Copyright PUNCH.
