The strike, according to NUPENG in the state, became necessary as a result of alleged indiscriminate arrest of tanker drivers and seizure of tankers belonging to members by the state task force which accused them of illegal parking. Before the strike was called-off, black market operators sold petrol at the rate of N350 per litre as against the government-approved price of N145 per litre.
