John Alechenu, Abuja Stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress in Edo State have given the Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum, Salihu Lukeman, seven days to withdraw “an offensive and malicious statement” or be prepared to face legal action. The group issued the threat in a statement jointly signed by Chief Francis Inegbeneki and Alhaji Suleiman Bagudu, in Abuja on Monday. According to the stakeholders, the memo by the PGFDG accusing the National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, of being the problem of the party was not only an insult but offensive. They were reacting to a memo written by the PGF DG, to the Chief Bisi Akande-led APC peace panel, on Sunday. The DG had accused the APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, of being the problem of the party. The group said, “Comrade Oshiomhole is not in the same category with small-minded men like Lukman, who are making frantic efforts to please their pay masters. “We find that statement as malicious as it was insulting and we have given the sycophantic DG of the Forum seven days to withdraw the offensive statement and apologise to Comrade Oshiomhole or risk a legal action.” Copyright PUNCH.
