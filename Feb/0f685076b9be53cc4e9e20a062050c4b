Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma, has threatened to revoke the agreements of contractors who abandoned their work. The governor, in a statement on Tuesday in Owerri  by his Chief Press Secretary, Oguwike Nwachukwu, said he would revoke the contracts if at the end of three days, the contractors failed to go back to sites. Uzodinma said that it was bad that contractors would abscond from sites after collecting mobilisation funds from the state government. The statement said, “Contractors handling road projects in Imo State have been ordered back to sites within 72 hours or have their contracts terminated. “This directive was given by Governor Hope Uzodinma in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary/Media Adviser, Mr Oguwike Nwachuku. “Governor Uzodinma frowned upon a situation where contractors who have collected mobilisation fees from government will abandon projects.” The statement also quoted the governor as saying, “Dry season usually marks the peak of road construction. Regrettably, the affected contractors have absconded from sites in the peak of the dry season.” Copyright PUNCH.
