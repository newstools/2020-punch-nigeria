A lot of people have joined the party after the last general elections, please, do not make it difficult for them to be registered in the party, register them now.” Osinowo noted that no state was like Lagos in Nigeria, adding that the APC had held on to power in the last 20 years because of the belief that the electorate had in the leadership of the party.
