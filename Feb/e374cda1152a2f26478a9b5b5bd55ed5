Solape Lawal-Solarin with Agency report Arsenal’s gem Bukayo Saka may walk out on the club on a free if the Gunners don’t strike a new deal with the teen soon. The 18-year-old has proven his worth ever since he made his debut for the senior side in late 2018 under previous manager, Unai Emery. But, with his contract already winding down, the North London side might lose him on a free as there has been no breakthrough in talks over a new contract, says the Telegraph. Saka is highly rated by new boss, Mikel Arteta, who has integrated the 18-year-old in the first team since he took over as manager in December, filling in at left-back with Kieran Tierney and Sead Kolasinac out injured. His performances have been impressive and other big clubs are aware of his progress and his contract situation, which would allow him to move next year with only a compensation fee applicable. Liverpool, Manchester United and Bayern Munich have all been credited with an interest in the exciting youngster, who would have a wealth of options open to him if he decides to run down his contract. Saka has scored 23 times, bagging six goals and grabbing three assists for the Gunners so far. Copyright PUNCH.
