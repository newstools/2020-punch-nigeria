Sodiq Oyeleke The Presidency has alleged that the Christian Association of Nigeria is antagonising the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) and misinforming Nigerians. This was contained in a press statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Wednesday. Adesina was reacting to the statement of CAN’s Director of Legal and Public Affairs, Kwamkur Samuel, alleging that the Presidency failed to pay ransom to rescue kidnapped Chibok girls because the majority of them are Christians. “Nigerians need to know if they have not known the reason why the Presidency could not pay ransom to rescue Chibok girls. It is because 80% to 90% of the girls are Christians. The reason why Dapchi girls’ ransom was quickly paid and they were returned is the discovery that most of the girls were Muslims except Leah Sharibu who is still in captivity,” Samuel was quoted as saying. However, Adesina said the retired general was ready to pay ransom for all the Chibok girls.

Without that, the claim remains what it is – a mere conjecture.” “And we ask, “Who should Nigerians or CAN rather believe if there is good faith? “We urge CAN to desist from disinformation which can further divide Nigerians. The letter and spirit of the Holy Bible do not support discord, which CAN’s allegations are liable to cause. “The Christian body need not be antagonistic to every attempt by the administration to move Nigeria forward before it can champion or defend the Christian faith. “President Muhammadu Buhari made it very clear in 2015 that if ransom needed to be paid to free the Chibok schoolgirls, he would pay. That is a testament to his commitment to get the girls back. “Notwithstanding our different faiths, we are all stakeholders in the promotion of peace in our fatherland. And the Holy Bible enjoins us to, “Seek peace, and pursue it.”
