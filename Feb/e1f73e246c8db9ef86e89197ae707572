Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin Properties estimated at several millions of Naira was on Friday destroyed by a midnight fire that razed over 12 shops at Railway Station area opposite the General Post Office in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital. The PUNCH gathered that the quick intervention of the state Fire Service saved a filling station closeby as well as about 180 adjoining shops from being gutted by the fire. The state Director of fire service, Alhaji Iyanda Yakub, attributed the cause of the fire to electric sparks caused by high power voltage from electricity supplied by the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company. Items destroyed by the inferno included textiles, bags, shoes, bags and children wares.

He said, “One of my neighbours called me at 1.00 am to tell me about the fire. At first, I didn’t know I could be involved but getting here, I saw all my items burnt to ashes. I just borrowed one million Naira to restock my shop but, see (pointing to the wreckage) all my items had burnt down. “I am married with a kid, how do I start and where do I start? I want the government to please come to our aid.” Speaking earlier with The PUNCH, the Head of Media and Publicity in the state fire service, Hassan Adekunle, said 12 shops were affected by the inferno out of about 200 shops in the complex.
