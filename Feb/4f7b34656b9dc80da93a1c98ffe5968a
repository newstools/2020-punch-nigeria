Johnny Edward Cyril Dessers has been cleared by Federation International Football Association to play for Nigeria at international level, Sports Extra has reliably gathered. Dessers, the son of a Belgian father and Nigerian mother, declared his intention to play for the Super Eagles ahead of Belgium in 2019. This means Dessers could make his international debut next month with the Eagles, who host Sierra Leone in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Stephen Keshi Stadium in Asaba. “Dessers is sure for Sierra Leone, what a squad that will be once he joins the rest of the squad, a deadly attack,” the President of the Nigerian Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick told Sports Extra exclusively. The Heracles Almelo forward is expected to provide both competition and backup for Lille’s striker, Victor Osimhen if he translates his club form to the international arena. Osimhen has scored four goals in his first eight games for the Eagles since his debut. So far this term, the 25-year-old Dessers has scored 17 goals in all competitions. Sports Extra also gathered that the paperwork for the duo Ovie Ejaria and Ademola Lookman are still on. “Ovie’s paperwork is still on but that of Lookman, not yet,” Pinnick disclosed to Sports Extra exclusively.
