Olaleye Aluko, Abuja No fewer than 300 internally displaced persons at the New Kuchingoro Internally Displaced Persons Camp, in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have undergone free eye tests and received drugs to tackle the rising eye infections in the camp. The IDPs were last Thursday attended to by a host of optometrists under the Safe Sight Project and were given “eye screening, blood sugar test, donation of eye glasses and eye drugs.” The Safe Sight Project was carried out by a serving corps member, Dr Adaku Obia, also an optometrist, and supported by a private eye hospital, the Supreme Vision. The President, Nigerian Optometric Association, Dr Ozy Okonokhua, at the donation, said the IDPs needed urgent attention from the Federal Ministry of Health and the FCT Health sector because any epidemic could easily spread among the people. He said, “The government must attend to the eradication of blindness in this country and particularly among the IDPs. Bringing the eye care services to the IDPs is one of the most pressing needs that the government must attend to.” The corps member, Obia, said the donation to the IDPs camp was her community development service project, adding that it was borne out of passion to assist the less privileged. She said, “The prevalent eye infections among the IDPs are conjunctivitis, glaucoma, refractive errors, myopia and bacterial infections. There are some cases relating to the IDPs’ eye pressure that we are not able to handle here. We have to refer them to our partner hospitals.” Copyright PUNCH.
