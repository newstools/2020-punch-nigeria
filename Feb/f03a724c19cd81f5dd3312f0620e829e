Godwin Isenyo and Edward Nnachi A former Aide-de-Camp to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Major Mustapha Jokolo (retd.), has called for the sacking of the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (retd.), and the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari. Jokolo was Buhari’s ADC from 1983 to 1985. He described the altercation between the NSA and the President’s CoS as capable of eroding the credibility of the leadership of the current regime. The monarch spoke in an interview with the Hausa Service of Radio France International, monitored in Kaduna on Thursday. Jokolo said the President ought to have fired the service chiefs following public outcry and worsening insecurity in Nigeria. He attributed the crisis between the two presidential aides to “greed and selfishness.” [READ ALSO] Service chiefs: What’s on Buhari’s mind? The monarch said, “The misunderstanding between them is born out of greed and selfishness. If not so, the two officers involved are brothers; they are both Muslims and from the same tribe. “President Buhari brought them to assist him in different roles. Why then should there be any conflict of roles?” Meanwhile, the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, on Thursday, alleged that Kyari was the one in charge of the Presidency and not Buhari. Kanu said, those who out of “sheer laziness and cowardice,” challenged the “irrefutable fact” that the Presidency was under the control of Buhari’s chief of staff, can now confirm it from the face-off between Monguno and Kyari.
