Matthew Ochei Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has decried renewed attacks by suspected herdsmen in Avwon, Agadama, Ohoror and other communities of Uwheru Kingdom in Ughelli North Local Government Area of the state. According to Okowa, suspected herdsmen accompanied by unidentified armed personnel attacked the communities in what has become an annual routine, killing over eight persons and injuring many others. He said the crisis started on Thursday and as of Saturday, lives, and property, including farms, had perished. The governor said, “The unwarranted attacks and killing of innocent locals in Avwon, Agadama and Ohoror communities of Uwheru Kingdom in Ughelli North Local Government Area and the wickedness of suspected herdsmen alleged to be aided by unidentified military personnel are mindless. “I, however, appeal to the affected communities to remain calm and peaceful. I commiserate with the communities and families on the unfortunate loss of their loved ones. “I have directed the Commissioner of Police and the Brigade Commander, 63 Brigade, Nigerian Army, to rise to the occasion and bring the culprits to justice.” Copyright PUNCH.
