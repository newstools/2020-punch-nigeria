Nike Popoola Afrinvest has projected a Gross Domestic Product Growth of 2.4 per cent for Nigeria’s 2020 financial period. The research firm disclosed this in its 2019 review and 2020 outlook report with the topic, ‘Nigeria in the new decade: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.’ Part of the report read, “We downgraded our 2019 growth forecast to 2.2 per cent in August from the initial 2.5 per cent due to weaker-than expected performance in the non-oil sector in first half of 2019. “Looking ahead, we forecast real GDP growth to expand to 2.4 per cent in 2020, driven by a moderate expansion in the oil and non-oil sectors.” Although the OPEC cap of 1.77mb/d (excluding condensates) could hurt oil production, the report said it expected compliance to be weak given the urgency to boost revenues. The high base from 2019 also limited the headroom for growth in the oil sector, it stated. It said the downside risks to its projection remained the inefficiency of major pipelines (Trans Forcados Pipelines and Nembe Creek Trunk Line), oil theft and resurgence of Niger-Delta crisis. In the non-oil sector, Afrinvest said it saw limited room for an outperformance given weak consumer spending and investment. It said the realignment of the budget cycle to January-December, starting January 1st 2020, was not expected to deliver a significant boost given the small size of the public sector. Copyright PUNCH.
