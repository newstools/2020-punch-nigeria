Olaleye Aluko, Abuja the National Youth Service Corps is set to secure  an operational licence for its proposed  N50m radio station. The NYSC Director General, Brig. Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim,  said this on Wednesday in Abuja. Ibrahim, who  spoke at the NYSC Press and Public Relations Officers’ workshop,  said  the corps’  officials needed to monitor  social media regularly and be prompt in debunking fake news. The DG said, “While I urge you to deepen and sustain the scheme’s presence in social media, you must be vigilant by continuously sensitising corps members to the need to avoid inappropriate use of the new media. “You must be proactive through constant engagements and timely disclosure of necessary information on the activities of the scheme as they unfold. “Efforts to establish the NYSC Community Radio  have moved into top gear as approval of the operational licence is being awaited.  We expect a boost in the scheme’s publicity drive when the station eventually comes on stream.” Copyright PUNCH.
