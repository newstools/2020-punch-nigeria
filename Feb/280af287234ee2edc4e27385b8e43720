Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Pensioners drawn from the 19 states of the North and Abuja have cried out over the 20 years arrears allegedly owed their colleagues in Zamfara State. The pensioners spoke on the heels of the controversies concerning the monthly allowances for the immediate past governor of the state, Abdulazeez Yari, which amounted to millions of naira. The ex-governor had protested the non-payment of his N10m as “upkeep allowance.” The pensioners, under the aegis of the 19 Northern States Pensioners Forum, made the observation at the end of their meeting in Kaduna on Friday. A communiqué issued at the end of the meeting read, “The Executive Governor of Zamfara State, His Excellency, Bello Matawalle, is called upon to look into the accumulated pension reviews for pensioners in the state that have piled up in Zamfara State for over 20 years with a view to implementing same. “We call on PTAD and all the state governors to as a matter of urgency attend to the accumulated pensions and gratuities of pensioners that have piled over the years while pensioners are dying. “The forum also called on the Federal and state governments to provide welfare packages for pensioners, such as free medical services and facilities for pensioners across the country as obtained in other parts of the world.” Copyright PUNCH.
