Striker Odion Ighalo will be able to travel with Manchester United for their Europa League tie in Bruges next week despite having to miss the club’s training camp in Marbella over the coronavirus alert. Ighalo, a deadline day signing from Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua, was left in Manchester when the United squad flew to Spain last Saturday amid fears he might not be allowed back in the UK if border controls were tightened this week. The Nigerian striker is among the travellers from China to the UK being monitored for 14 days, although he did not have to be quarantined because he arrived from Shanghai, not Wuhan, where the virus originated.

The 30-year-old, who has moved to Old Trafford on loan until the end of the season, is expected to make his debut against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge three days earlier. Ighalo’s absence from this week’s warm-weather training camp in Marbella is still a setback for manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who was hoping the former Watford striker could get to know his new teammates and integrate into the squad.
