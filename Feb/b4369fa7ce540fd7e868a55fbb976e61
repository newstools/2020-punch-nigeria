The Lagos State Government says it will plant one million coconut seedlings along the 135-kilomere Badagry-Ibeju-Lekki coastline. The General Manager, Lagos State Coconut Development Authority, Mr Dapo Olakulehin, told the News Agency of Nigeria that the coastline had shrunk due to human activities. Olakulehin spoke with NAN after a joint fact-finding mission to the LASCODA’s formation and coconut plantations in Badagry undertaken in collaboration with the General Manager, Agricultural Land Holding Authority, Mr Dapo Are. The LASCODA boss said, “The target is to plant one million coconut trees on the coastline from Badagry to Ibeju-Lekki to replace the old and unproductive trees. “This will be done with the active involvement of the private sector and the communities along the coastline. “The major sources of livelihood of most coastal communities along this stretch are fish and coconut value chains. “Our objective is to restore coconut back to its old place by the ocean belt.” Copyright PUNCH.
