Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has asked the Federal Government to extend the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, to at least, a ten-lane road. Abiodun made this call when he received the Senate Committee on Works in his office, in Abeokuta, on Thursday. According to him, the road in question is arguably the busiest in the country. This, coupled with the population explosion, made the expansion of the road from six to ten lanes imperative. He also said it was important for the Federal Government to consider alternatives like the Sagamu to Ikorodu road as well as the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta road. The governor said, “What is required would be like, at least a ten-lane road pattern, at the minimum. That should be considered by the Federal Government. “I want to call on you to help us declare an emergency on the state of our federal roads. It is as if, they are non-existent. “We looked at these roads and we said it is important for people to be able to move between the states and the sub-region that share borders with us.” Abiodun informed the committee of efforts being put in place by his administration and its Lagos State counterpart at ensuring that the two roads (Sagamu-Ogijo-Ikorodu and Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta) receive immediate attention. In his response, the Chairman, Senate Committee for Works, Senator Adamu Aliero, said they were in the state to inspect all federal projects, especially road projects. Copyright PUNCH.
