Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti An Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday sentenced a 25-year-old man, Ojo Adams, to three months’ imprisonment for unlawful possession of stolen goods. Adams pleaded guilty to the one count and was sentenced. The police prosecutor, Inspector Caleb Leranmo, told the court that the convict committed the offence on February 9 around 10am at the Bisi Market area in Ado-Ekiti. Leranmo said, “A 2000 watts Century stabiliser and three sacks containing provisions, suspected to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained, were found in Adams’ possession. “Adams came with the stabiliser and the provisions from Kogi State to Ekiti State to sell them. He went to Ifaki-Ekiti to sell the provisions and from there, he moved to Ado-Ekiti at the popular Bisi Market to sell the remaining items. “Adams was suspected by the traders that the provisions were stolen goods; they immediately reported him to the police and he was apprehended. “He, however, could not give concrete evidence on the ownership of the provisions.” He noted that the offence contravened Section 430 of the Criminal Code Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. The police prosecutor also told the court that the provisions were recovered from the convict and tendered as evidence before the court. Adams pleaded guilty when the charges were read to him. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Abdulhamid Lawal, sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment with the option of N10,000 fine. Lawal ordered that the goods recovered should be kept in the custody of the court until further directive. Copyright PUNCH.
