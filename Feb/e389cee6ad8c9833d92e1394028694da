Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday fixed February 21 for the trial of a Bayelsa State-based journalist, Jones Abiri. He was on June 24, 2019 arraigned by the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation on three counts of terrorism, economic sabotage and fraud. He was held in detention by the Department of State Services without trial for about two years before the court upheld his fundamental human rights enforcement suit ordering his release from detention. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, on Monday, adjourned his trial till April 21 after she granted an application by the prosecution to allow its witnesses to testify behind a shield. The prosecution had expressed fear that its witnesses were unwilling to testify in the case. In its application dated June 20, 2019, the prosecution had sought the protection of its witnesses by allowing them to be shielded and only to be seen by the judge and parties involved in the case.
