The Oyo State Government has ordered the immediate suspension of 13 primary school headteachers, two assistant headteachers and a classroom teacher for alleged extortion and other misconducts. The Executive Chairman, Oyo State Universal Basic Education Board, Dr Nureni Adeniran, gave the order during an inspection tour of some schools in Ibadan metropolis. According to a statement by Adeniran’s Media Aide, Olamide Adeniji, the suspended teachers will face a disciplinary committee set up by the board. According to him, the committee has been mandated to ensure a thorough probe of the allegations and give all concerned fair hearing. He said the state would not tolerate inequity and gross indiscipline amongst teachers. The SUBEB chairman said, “It was during our tour of schools that we discovered the failure of some teachers to comply with posting instructions, while some of them were collecting illegal money from the pupils, despite the reiteration of the free-education policy of this administration. “So far, we have discovered that some saboteurs are among the teachers, who are flouting the state government’s directives and pulling down our efforts to sanitise the teaching system in the state. “We discovered that the absence of supervision and monitoring of educational activities in the state has given so much room for impunity and indiscipline. We will not allow this to happen henceforth. “This will serve as a deterrent to saboteurs among headteachers in the state. “They shall know henceforth, that the state government will not tolerate indiscipline.” (NAN)
