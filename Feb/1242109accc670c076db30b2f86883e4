Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Port Harcourt Zonal Office, has arrested a blogger, Mr Dikeocha Chukwuebuka, for publishing a photograph of a crowded open cell on his Twitter handle. Chukwuebuka had on his Twitter handle, @TheRealDayne, claimed that the crowded cell belonged to the Port Harcourt zonal office of the EFCC, an allegation that was denied by the anti-graft agency. Irked by the said false publication, the Zonal Head of the EFCC, Mr Usman Imam, while briefing newsmen in Port Harcourt on Thursday, said the suspect was picked up around 4pm on Wednesday on the premises of a new generation bank on Ada George Road, Port Harcourt. Imam said the arrest was in fulfilment of the vow he made to track and apprehend the author of the malicious tweet. He said the tweet caused a most embarrassing moment for the commission, adding that the fake news represented the opposite of what the EFCC stood for as far as care of detainees was concerned. “I want to assure the suspect and indeed the media that the commission will follow through this investigation and ensure that justice is served in accordance with the law,” he said. Imam warned social media influencers to be circumspect in using information, which they had not verified in order to save the society from the ordeal of fake news. A remorseful Chukwuebuka admitted his error in publishing the picture, which he said belonged to another agency. He apologised to the EFCC and his followers for the false and misleading report.
