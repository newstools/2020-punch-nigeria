Borussia Dortmund winger Julian Brandt faces a race to be fit for the German side’s Champions League last-16 tie against Paris Saint-Germain after the club confirmed on Sunday that he had suffered an ankle injury. The 23-year-old was substituted at half-time of Saturday’s 4-3 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen, which left his team third in the Bundesliga. Dortmund said Brandt had suffered torn ankle ligaments and will miss Friday’s league clash at Eintracht Frankfurt.
