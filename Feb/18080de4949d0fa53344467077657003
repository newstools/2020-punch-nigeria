Samuel Awoyinfa No fewer than 3,100 women across all six regions of the country were screened for breast cancer by Shoprite Nigeria in partnership with Run For a Cure Africa . The event, tagged  ‘The Big Pink Fight​,‘ held between February 3 and 8, 2020 and gave Nigerian women the opportunity to undergo clinical breast examination, including ultrasound scans and mammograms. A statement from the retail store said four out of the six screening stations were located at Shoprite supermarkets in Asaba, Onitsha, Abuja and Kano. “As a result of Shoprite’s partnership with RFCA, which dates back to 2014, more than 8,000 women have now undergone screenings,” says Shoprite Nigeria’s Kunle Abiola. While speaking to newsmen at Novare Gateway Mall Abuja during the event, Abiola further expressed satisfaction. “We’re thrilled about the great turnout this year and we plan to roll this initiative out to more communities where we trade. “Nearly 100 per cent of the time, women with breast cancer survive if the cancer is discovered early, but unfortunately this number is reversed in Nigeria because of late detection,” says Dr Ebele Mbanugo, founder and executive director of RFCA.
