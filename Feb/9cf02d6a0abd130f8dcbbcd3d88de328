Kelvin Ekerete Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, says scoring for the Red Devils was a childhood dream that has become a reality. The January signing on loan from Chinese side Shanghai Shenhua made his first start for the club due to a last-minute slight thigh injury to forward Anthony Martial who had earlier been scheduled to begin the game. Speaking after scoring his first goal for the team, Ighalo revealed that it was a dream come through for him. “Scoring feels great because it is what I have always been waiting for. Playing and scoring for Manchester United means a lot to me. I’m going to cherish this moment for the rest of my life,” he told BT Sports. “It is such a great moment. I’ve been waiting for this. I’ve played three games without a goal though I didn’t play so much and there was a little bit of pressure but now, I got a goal to start my United goal career and it is the team I have supported from a young age so I am really happy. “It is what I have always dreamt of and realising it makes it better so I’m very happy about it.” The Nigerian also stated that winning with such a margin was because the team never took their foot off the gas. “The confidence was high. We spoke about that before the start of the game. The fans are behind us so we had to go all out so from the first minute we started pushing so we had to win to go to the next round. “The first half opened everything and the red card they got made things difficult for them with us also attacking but bottom line, we worked hard from the start till the last minute.” Copyright PUNCH.
