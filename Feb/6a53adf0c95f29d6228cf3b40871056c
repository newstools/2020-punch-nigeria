There was a protest in the Ikeja area of Lagos State on Monday over the ban on commercial motorcycles (okada) and tricycles (keke) in 15 local councils and major roads in the state. Before Monday’s protest, thousands of motorcycle riders working for Gokada and Max had on Friday protested at the Lagos State House of Assembly.
