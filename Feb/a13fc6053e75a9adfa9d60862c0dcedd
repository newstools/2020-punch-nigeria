A professor of economics at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State, Sheriffdeen Tella, told our correspondent that the country had a debt problem contrary to the claim of the Federal Government. Tella said, “We have a debt problem because when you have problem with debt servicing, then you have a serious debt problem.” A former Director General, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Chijioke Ekechukwu, said the rising debt portended danger for the economy. He said rather than continue to rely on borrowing to finance its activities, the Federal Government should adopt other sources of funding the infrastructure needs of the country. Copyright PUNCH.
