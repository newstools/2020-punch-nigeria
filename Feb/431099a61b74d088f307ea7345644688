It was gathered that the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, also joined in the emergency operation on Third Mainland Bridge. “The wreckage of the burnt truck laden with several bundles of cardboard paper and other combustible materials was recovered by the LASEMA Response Team off. No lives were lost or injuries recorded,” LASEMA said in a statement by the agency’s Public Affairs Officer, Nosa Okunbor.
