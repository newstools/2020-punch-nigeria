Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Olawale Fapohunda, on Friday accused some teachers in the state of raping their pupils. This was as the Commissioner for Education, Foluso Daramola, bemoaned reports of sexual harassment and cases of rape in some secondary schools in the state. Daramola, in a statement in Ado Ekiti on Sunday, assured the public “that investigations have commenced into the allegations in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. At the end of the investigations, those found culpable will be dealt with in accordance with extant regulations”. Fapohunda, who raised concerns about the frequency of reports of sexual violence in secondary schools across the state, said his office would “aggressively prosecute any teacher who violated the Ekiti State Gender-Based Violation Prohibition Law 2019.” The AG spoke in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, at a meeting with the Nigeria Union of Teachers to formally inform them of the joint investigations by the Ministry of Justice and the state police command into allegations of sexual violence in schools. He charged the NUT to “take immediate and urgent action to identify the very few who are bringing the name of the union into disrepute.” Copyright PUNCH.
