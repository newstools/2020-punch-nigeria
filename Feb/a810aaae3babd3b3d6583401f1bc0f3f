Sola Shittu Benin The National President, Christian Association of Nigeria, Rev. Samsom Ayokunle, on Monday said he and his team escaped terrorists last week while on tour of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital. Ayokunle, who was represented by a National Director at CAN headquarters in Abuja, Bishop Stephen Adegbite, stated this at the inauguration of a new state executive committee of CAN for Edo State. He said, “We were going to Maiduguri last week with our president, our vehicle broke down on the road and we had to take three taxis to our destination. They (terrorists) laid ambush expecting to see CAN vehicles and then attack only for them to hear that we have arrived our destination. They killed 31 people that night for missing their target.” He called for unity among Christians in the midst of attacks from suspected terrorists, bandits and other violent crimes against Christians.

The leadership of CAN is always under threat but it must ensure unity because we have our members all over the country. So, what else do we do than to remain united and work together?” Copyright PUNCH.
