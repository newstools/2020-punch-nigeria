Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Bayelsa State Police Command has extended by six days the dusk-to-dawn curfew it imposed on the state due to the violent protests that rocked parts of Yenagoa following the Supreme Court judgment that sacked the All Progressives Congress’ governorship candidate, David Lyon. The state Commissioner of Police, Uche Anozia, announced the extension of the curfew during a press briefing at the command’s headquarters in Yenagoa on Monday. Anozia said the command reviewed the curfew and extended the security measure from February 17 to February 23, from 10pm to 6am each day. He had on Friday, shortly before the inauguration of the state governor, Douye Diri and his deputy, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, announced a three-day curfew from, February 14 to February 16, between 8pm and 6am each day to halt the escalation of the riot. Anozia, however, said, “In light of the credible intelligence available to the command vis-a-vis the prevailing security situation in Bayelsa State, the command has deemed it necessary to review and extend the curfew to Sunday, 23rd February, 2020 with effect from Monday, 17th February, 2020, from 10pm to 6am.” Copyright PUNCH.
