Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said his administration will increase investment in low-cost housing to reduce housing deficit in the state. The governor made this known during the handover of keys to allotees of the Alhaji Lateef Jakande Gardens in the Igando area of Lagos. Sanwo-Olu said the state government was collaborating with professionals and stakeholders in the built environment to further reduce the cost of building and increase more housing in the state. He said, “We are currently holding discussions to increase low-cost houses in the state. We promised we will hand over keys in the first quarter of 2020 and this is just January. “Shelter is a critical need for stability in all spheres of life and governance is about impact and touching lives of our people. Housing is important to everyone; we are keeping the promises of the present administration in the provision of decent homes for the people.” The governor said his government would also be looking at building social houses with mortgage facilities to make payment flexible. He added that his administration would do more of ‘rent-to-own’ houses for residents of the state. “In a bid to encourage our civil servants, we will reserve 10 per cent of all estates to ensure they also become homeowners while we ensure speedy completion of all ongoing estates. We will also encourage them with a rebate,” the governor said. Copyright PUNCH.
