Following her conviction by a Federal Capital Territory High Court over the murder of her husband, Bilyaminu Bello, Maryam Sanda has approached the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division to set aside the verdict and acquit her. Sanda, who was sentenced to death by hanging by Justice Yusuf Halilu on January 27, said the trial judge “was tainted by bias and prejudices”. In a notice of appeal predicated on 20 grounds and filed by her legal team comprised of Rickey Tarfa, SAN; Olusegun Jolaawo, SAN; Regina Okotie-Eboh and Beatrice Tarfa, the applicant said the judgement of the trial court was a complete “miscarriage of justice”.

It was submitted that “the circumstantial evidence which the trial court relied upon in its application of the last seen doctrine does not lead to the conclusion that the defendant is responsible for the death of the deceased.” Consequently, Sanda prayed the Court of Appeal to allow her appeal, set aside her conviction and sentence imposed by Justice Halilu and acquit her. No date has been fixed for hearing in the matter. (NAN)
