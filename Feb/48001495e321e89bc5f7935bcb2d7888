Oladimeji Ramon The Sokoto State Commissioner for Finance, Abdussamad Dasuki, has said the N65.7bn loan being sought by the state is for the purpose of fast-tracking development in the state. He said this was in line with the Governor Aminu Tambuwal administration’s focus on human capital development and its ambition to remodel Sokoto State into an investment destination. Dasuki, according to a statement on Tuesday by Tambuwal’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Muhammad Bello, spoke in Lagos at the management retreat of the Sokoto State Ministry of Finance. He said, “As a government, we believe it is important to invest in the education of our people. In this light, we have continued the renovation of secondary schools across the state. Already more than 100 secondary schools have been remodelled and renovated. “The Tambuwal administration has gone far in its social intervention programme and N4bn has been set aside for distribution to indigenes of the state to enable them to engage in and enhance any business of their choice.” Copyright PUNCH.
