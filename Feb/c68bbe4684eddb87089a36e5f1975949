Be focused and provide qualitative leadership. When you take decisions, consult your people. Take decisions that reflect the collective will and desires of  your people and do not impose taxes and rates that are not known to our laws. It’s extortion and I won’t encourage that.” He called on them to take advantage of the geographical location of the state by attracting investments to their local governments.
