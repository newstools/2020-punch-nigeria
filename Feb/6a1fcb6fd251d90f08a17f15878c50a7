Olaide Oyelude, Katsina A 40-year-old man, lliyasu Abubakar, has been arraigned before a Katsina Senior Magistrates’ Court for being in possession of a truck load of cattle suspected to have been stolen. He was charged with criminal conspiracy, armed robbery, cattle rustling and receiving stolen cattle. Trouble started for Abubakar, a resident of the Salilawa village in the Matazu Local Government Area of the state, December 28, 2019, when policemen from the Matazu Divisional Headquarters received information that a truck load of cows suspected to have been stolen was sighted in the village. Police investigations resulted in Abubakar’s arrest and subsequent arraignment. The suspect allegedly confessed to committing the offences during interrogation as he reportedly told police interrogators that he bought 10 of the cows from one Isah Kuki (deceased) and another set from one Bello Abdulrahman, who had since gone into hiding. The police also said three persons, Adamu Saidu, Babangida Umar and Abdulmumin Sani, came forward and identified five of cows as theirs. Abubakar’s offences were said to be contrary to sections 59, 281, 270 and 300 of the Katsina State Penal Code of 2019. The police prosecutor, Sergeant Lawal Bello, prayed the court to adjourn the matter to another date to enable investigators to conclude their assignment. The presiding magistrate, Hajiya Fadile Dikko, while granting the prayer, ordered that the defendant be remanded in a correctional facility until March 5, 2020, when the case was scheduled to be mentioned.
