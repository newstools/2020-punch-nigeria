Ebenezer Bajela Ex-Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo’s move to Manchester United came as a big surprise to many of the club’s faithful. However,a former teammate of Ighalo at Watford, Adrian Mariappa, who shared the same locker room with the Nigerian during their time at Vicarage Road, has thrown his weight behind him, as he reckons that he is more talented than many are aware of. “He’s probably more skillful than people realise,” Mariappa said of Ighalo. “His first season in the Premier League, I think he was chopping every defender in sight, and once he’d get in the box he’s clinical. He’s very good at finding half a yard of space to get a shot off and when he does it hits the target more often than not, so he’s definitely one you need to watch out for as a defender.” On what Ighalo could offer to fans at Old Trafford, Mariappa said the striker’s work rate would speak for him. “Only time will tell, but he’s a striker that will score goals. “It’ll be a tough job in itself to get in the side with their group of top, foreign players, but knowing him he’ll be training hard to get in there and really show what he’s about. “He trains hard. He loves scoring goals even in training and wouldn’t surprise you with the odd worldie here and there. Even the times he was out of the side he still trained well which a good quality to have is. There’s a reason why he’s still in good condition scoring goals wherever he’s playing and you can see on social media he works incredibly hard on and off the football pitch.” Copyright PUNCH.
