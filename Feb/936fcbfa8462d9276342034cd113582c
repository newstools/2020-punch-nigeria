Gibson  Achonu, Owerri As the Independent National  Electoral Commission intensifies preparations for the conduct of a by-election for the Imo North Senatorial seat, indications have emerged that political heavyweights from the area are now in a battle of wits to grab the exalted office. The seat became vacant following the death of the Senator for the zone, Benjamin Uwajumogu, last December. Investigation by our correspondent showed that while Senator Ifeanyi Araraume, a two time senator for the zone, had commenced intensive mobilisation of the people to re-launch himself, Chief Ikedi Ohakim, a former governor of the state, had not hidden his ambition to succeed the late Uwajumogu. A multi-billionnaire businessman and a former senator for the zone, Chief Athan Achonu, had similarly oiled his political machinery for a second journey to the upper legislative chamber. Araraume who contested the 2019 governorship election under the platform of the All Progressive Grand Alliance was said to be on his way back to the APC from where he jumped the ship to the APGA. He was alleged to be enjoying the backing of Governor Hope Uzodinma who he reportedly assisted to secure victory. Copyright PUNCH.
