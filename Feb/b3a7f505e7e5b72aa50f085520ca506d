The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has commiserated with the family of victims of attacks at Auno village, along Damaturu–Maiduguri Road, assuring them that his regime will continually frustrate the devilish operations of Boko Haram, and bring it to an end. In a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Monday, Buhari condemned the “murderous and cowardly” attack on innocent passengers by the Boko Haram terrorists near Maiduguri. During that attack, about 30 people were killed, while many women and children were abducted. According to the retired general, his regime is determined to frustrate their goal to hold Nigeria to ransom. He said, “The commitment of this administration to protect the lives of Nigerians will not be derailed by the cowardly and indiscriminate violence against innocent people by Boko Haram terrorists.” The president, who also condoled with Borno State Government over the attacks, warned that ”terrorists are clearly on a back foot and their days are numbered”. He added, “As our armed forces continue to receive more hardware and intelligence to counter our current security challenges, the remnants of Boko Haram will ultimately be crushed. ”The peculiar challenges of asymmetric warfare notwithstanding, our Armed Forces are ever determined to defeat these enemies of humanity.” News Agency of Nigeria reports that the Auno attacks, which took place at about 9.45 pm on Sunday, claimed the lives of innocent travellers, whose vehicles on the convoy were attacked and burnt by the Boko Haram insurgents. NAN reports that the video clips on the attacks showing burnt human bodies and vehicles went viral on social media on Monday. (NAN)
