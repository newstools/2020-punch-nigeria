Solape Lawal-Solarin Former Super Eagles winger, Victor Moses, alongside his Nerrazzuri teammates will be forced to play their Europa last 32 return leg against Bulgarian side, Ludogrets Razgrad, at the San Siro behind closed doors owing to the outbreak of coronavirus in northern Italy. The coronavirus have sent Italian football authorities and national government into overdrive as matches in the Serie A and Serie B were called off for safety reasons. More than 30 new cases were reported in Italy’s two worst-hit regions overnight, taking the total to over 320, officials said. The death toll remained unchanged at 11. Fellow EU members Croatia, Greece, Austria and Switzerland have all reported their first cases in the last two days while France confirmed a second death from the virus on Wednesday and a total of 17 cases. Hence, the continent’s governing body has resolved to place Thursday’s (today) Europa clash between the Italian giants and the Bulgarians under closed door. “Following the decisions of the Italian authorities, the UEFA Europa League match between Inter Milan and Ludogorets Razgrad will be played behind closed doors at the Stadio San Siro,” UEFA said in a statement. It means, the 80,000 San Siro will be empty as Moses and his teammates will seek to secure a last 16 spot after winning the first leg 2-0. Copyright PUNCH.
