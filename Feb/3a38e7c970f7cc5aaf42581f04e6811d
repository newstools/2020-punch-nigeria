Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki TWO students of the Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki, are currently battling for their lives at the National Obstetric Fistula Centre, Abakaliki, years after going through female genital mutilation. Southern City News gathered that the two students were at the centre for confirmed complications 16 years after they were genitally mutilated. The Ebonyi State Violence Against Persons Prohibition Law stipulates four years’ imprisonment with or without N200,000 option of fine against perpetrators of FGM in the state if convicted. Three persons were, however, arrested in Ohaukwu Local Government Area of the state for the alleged mutilation of a 16-year-old girl’s genitals. On Thursday, the state Director of the Violence Against Persons Prohibition, Dr Emma Abah, confirmed the development while addressing students of Urban Model Comprehensive Girls Secondary School, Ugwuachara, in the Ebonyi LGA during the 2020 International Day of Zero Tolerance against FGM. While reiterating that two female students of the Ebonyi State University were battling for survival following complications of FGM, Abah urged the students not to allow anybody to mutilate their genitals.
