Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Middle Belt Forum has said security agencies need to awake to their responsibilities as certain forces are plotting to cause breakdown of law and order in Taraba State. The Middle Belt leaders on Sunday in a statement by its National President, Dr Pogu Bitrus, noted that “a possible resurgence of violence in the state should serve as a wake-up call on security personnel.” The leaders added that the concerns expressed in some quarters over the absence of Governor Darius Ishaku in Jalingo, and his stay in Abuja, were uncalled for, and should not be used as an excuse to foment crisis. The MBF said, “As the umbrella organisation representing ethnic nationalities in the Middle Belt Region, we wish to state that Governor Ishaku has been avowedly committed to the defence of lives and property as demonstrated by the state government’s act of embarking on development projects towards peace and harmony amongst the diverse ethnic groups in the state. “The concerns expressed in some quarters over the seeming absence of Governor Ishaku and linking same to a possible resurgence of violence in the state should serve as a wake-up call on security personnel, as there may be certain forces plotting to cause the breakdown of law and order in the state. “There are many states in Nigeria that have come under unmitigated attacks even when their governors were perpetually on their seats.” Copyright PUNCH.
