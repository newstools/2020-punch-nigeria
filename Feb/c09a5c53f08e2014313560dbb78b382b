TED ODOGWU Kano State Governor  Abdullahi Ganduje has  said   his  victory  at the Supreme  and the All Progressives Congress’ overwhelming success in  last year’s  National Assembly and  state House of Assembly polls  has signalled  Rabiu Kwankwaso’s retirement  from politics. Kwankwaso, a former governor of the state,  is regarded as the strongman of Kano politics. Ganduje said when the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Abdul’aziz Gafasa,  APC leaders  in the state and others  presented  him  four lawmakers after collecting their certificates of return from the Independent National Electoral Commission. The governor said   “the last straw that broke Kwankwaso’s back” was the recent  Supreme Court judgment  affirming  his victory in last year’s governorship  poll in the state. He said,  “A few years ago when Kwankwaso was warming up to contest the presidential election, he boastedthat  he would retire President Muhammadu Buhari from politics. “He also boasted that he would retire me from politics. But if you take a look at the unfolding political scenario, who then is forced to retire?” Meanwhile, Ganduje has congratulated Kwankwaso’s father, Alhaji Musa Kwankwaso, for his elevation from Majidadin Karaye to the position of Makaman Karaye Emirate – a kingmaker in the emirate. Ganduje said Kwankwaso’s father deserved the elevation. He said, “I congratulate our respectful father and an elder statesman on behalf of the government and people of Kano State. “We pray that Allah bless him with the wisdom to enable him to discharge all his assigned responsibilities very well. Our father is very hardworking and very close to his people.” Copyright PUNCH.
