Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford will be absent for another few weeks, placing a heavy burden on deadline-day loan signing Ighalo to score the goals that can haul United up the table. Ighalo has had a far from ideal start to his United career, Skysports reports. The Nigerian joined up with the United squad for the first time on Sunday after a two-week precautionary quarantine following his arrival from Shanghai Shenua. “It’s a loan but when you are in the door here and if you impress it gives you a chance,” said Solskjaer. “That is exactly the same for anyone who signs, if it is permanent or a loan. “If you impress as a player and as a person, if you can help this group improve, of course there is a chance that we will look at extending things.”
