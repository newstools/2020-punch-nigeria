Wale Oyewole, Ibadan The Court of Appeal sitting in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Monday adjourned the hearing of the suit between the Oyo State Government and the 68 sacked local government chairmen till April 1. The Oyo State Government is challenging a court order against the dissolution of the chairmen in the 68 councils in the state. The sacked chairmen had insisted that they were legally qualified to retain their positions as chairmen, having been elected, just as the state government argued that the grounds of their emergence were invalid. Justice Aderonke Aderemi of the Oyo State High Court in Ibadan had, on May 6, ruled against the dissolution of the council chairmen. At the resumed hearing of the suit on Monday, counsel for the respondents, Niyi Akintola (SAN), who told the court that he filed his brief of argument out of time, prayed the court to grant his application for extension of time. Counsel for the claimants, Kunle Kalejaye, (SAN), did not oppose the application. The three-man panel of appeal, chaired by Justice Jimi Bada, granted the application for extension of time. Bada adjourned hearing in the main appeal till April 1. Copyright PUNCH.
