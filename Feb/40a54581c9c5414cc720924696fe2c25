Britain’s finance minister, Sajid Javid, resigned on Thursday, just weeks after Brexit and a month before he was due to deliver the government’s annual budget. Javid’s spokesman confirmed he would be leaving just as Prime Minister Boris Johnson carried out the first reshuffle of his cabinet since winning a parliamentary majority in December’s election. (AFP)
