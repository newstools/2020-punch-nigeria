Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia The directive of the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Abia State, Johnson Onuigbo, that sale of forms for the party congresses should begin on Monday (today) at the party secretariat in Umuahia has been suspended indefinitely. According to the state Organising Secretary, St. Moses Ogbonna, “a new date will be communicated.” Findings showed that this might not be unconnected with a congress committee set up recently by the caucus of party in the state that directed all at the wards and local government areas to go home and harmonise their offices. The caucus, it was said, would determine who returned or the zoning at the state level. Copyright PUNCH.
