Success Nwogu, Abuja A former Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar, on Wednesday urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), not to rationalise killings. Buhari, had in an article published in Speaking Out, a guest opinion column for Christianity Today, on Tuesday, said 90 per cent of all victims of Boko Haram atrocities were Muslims, adding that the perception that Boko Haram insurgents were always targeting Christians in Nigeria was untrue. But Atiku, who was the candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, in the 2019 presidential election, cautioned the President against rationalising killings. Atiku, on his verified personal twitter handle, @atiku, said killings by any misguided group was wrong and should be condemned. He tweeted, “We must not rationalise killings. Whether Christian, Muslim, traditionalist, or Atheist, the killing of any human being, by Boko Haram, or any other misguided group, is wrong and should be condemned unequivocally. There is no compulsion in religion. Only love -AA.” Copyright PUNCH.
