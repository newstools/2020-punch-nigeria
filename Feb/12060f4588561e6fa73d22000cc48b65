Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders’ Forum has said Nigeria is currently bleeding and needs to be salvaged from a possible disintegration. The leaders said on Sunday that their forum therefore welcomed the decision of the Senate committee to review the report of the 2014 Sovereign National Conference, noting that it would offer the National Assembly the necessary cooperation. The SMBLF stated this in a release signed on Sunday by Yinka Odumakin from the South-West, Gen. Collins Ihekire from the South-East, Senator Bassey Henshaw from the South-South and Dr Isuwa Dogo from the Middle Belt. The forum added that the bad state of the country was testified to by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and the Senate committee must therefore examine the conference with “seriousness.” The leaders said, “The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum’s attention has been drawn to the decision of the Senate Committee on Constitution Review to consider the report of the 2014 National Conference and that of the El-Rufai committee in the discharge of the onerous task before them. “We welcome their decision with a promise of our readiness to offer them all necessary cooperation in this regard. Nigeria is currently bleeding and needs to be salvaged from a possible disintegration. “The bad state of the country was testified to by the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, who declared after a meeting with President Buhari recently that the country had reached a tipping point.” Copyright PUNCH.
