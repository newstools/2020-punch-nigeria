Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi Ibrahim, the son of a Bauchi-based journalist, Nura Faggo, was on Monday burnt to death in a fire that gutted his father’s residence in Wuntin Dada, in the Bauchi metropolis. Nura, a staff member of Radio Nigeria Globe FM, Bauchi, said the source of the fire, which started around 5.30pm, had not yet been ascertained. Nura said his late son had accompanied him to his car in the morning when he was going to the office. He described the incident as “sad, traumatic and devastating.” “The mother could hear him crying and calling her, but there was nothing she could do to save him because the fire was already intense and no one could go in. “So, you can imagine the pain the mother is going through right now, and then for me, who came and saw the corpse burnt beyond recognition. “When I left in the morning, he was hale and hearty; he even saw me off to my car when I was going out. And for me to come back and see him in such a state and to the level that I could not even recognise him, it is a traumatic situation,” he said. He, however, expressed gratitude to God over the incident, saying He gave him the child and He took him away. Copyright PUNCH.
