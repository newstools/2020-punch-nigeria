CHIMA AZUBUIKE Justice Fatima Musa of the Gombe State High Court 13, has sentenced one Usman Shagari, to one year’s imprisonment for the production and sales of adulterated fertiliser in Gombe and Bauchi states. The Gombe zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission had arraigned the suspect in 2019. Other suspects arrested were Idris Ali, Muhammad Alaramma, Dahiru Salisu and Adamu Abdurahman, arraigned on ten counts bordering on the same offence. They pleaded not guilty to the charges and elected summary trial. According to the prosecution counsel, M. D. Aliyu, the convict and the other suspects reportedly bought genuine fertiliser from recognised companies and the Federal Government but later mixed it with sand to maximise profit. “When the commission was alerted, the intelligence section of the zone swung into action, on Saturday, July 27, 2019 and raided three illegal factories located at Lariski village in the Kirfi Local Government Area of Bauchi State and Gombe metropolis where fertiliser was manufactured,” he said. Aliyu further prayed the trial judge to pronounce Shagari guilty as charged of the six counts. In her judgment, Justice Fatima Musa sentenced Shagari to one year’s imprisonment with an option of N150, 000 as fine. The judge ordered total destruction of the confiscated fertiliser.
