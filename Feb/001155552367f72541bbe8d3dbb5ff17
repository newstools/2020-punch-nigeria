Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Senate on Thursday set up a roundtable panel to ensure a proper budgeting process for the country. The Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege,  announced the setting up of the panel following a motion sponsored by Senator Stella  Oduah. The Senate therefore mandated the committees on National Planning, Appropriations, and Finance to conduct a thorough review of Nigeria’s budgeting practices. The panel would also assess the national planning process with a view to creating a more synergised and collaborative system that is both effective and efficient. Oduah, while presenting her motion, stressed the need to establish a budget-driven national planning framework for Nigeria. She expressed concern that despite an incremental growth in the nation’s nominal Gross Domestic Product and Gross National Income over the years, an average Nigerian had experienced little or no change in their socioeconomic status.
