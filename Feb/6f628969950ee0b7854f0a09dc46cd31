Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The Federal Capital Territory Administration has threatened to sack any secondary school principal who fails to observe all extant rules and regulations. The warning was issued during an emergency meeting of all the principals of public secondary schools convened by the Chairman, FCT Secondary Education Board, Mr Yahaya Muhammad. Muhammad said the meeting became necessary following the unscheduled recent visit to FCT schools by the Minister, Mallam Muhammad Bello,  which exposed the principals’ inefficiencies. The Chairman, who berated the principals’ poor sanitation and flagrant abuses of safety rules in their various schools, also condemned some of the teachers attitude,  which he noted was detrimental to the administration of FCT. He further directed that all the illegal trading activities going on around the school  perimeter fences and indiscriminate farming by workers on the school premises be discontinued. He said, “Anybody that cannot key in, I say that person must be kicked out.” Copyright PUNCH.
