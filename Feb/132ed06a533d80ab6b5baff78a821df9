Adebayo Folorunsho-Francis Stakeholders have expressed worry over the increasing number of newly trained pharmacists who are constantly migrating abroad in search of greener pastures. Pharmacy professionals in the health sector said the trend could prove disastrous if not checked. Speaking with PUNCH HealthWise, the Deputy Director of Pharmacy at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, Kingsley Ekwunife, said many young pharmacists seemed to prefer Canada and other first world countries. “We are talking about some of our brightest brains here.

He said that despite being drug experts and researchers, pharmacists are often denied needed government support and conducive work environment to excel. The pharmacy director also identified poor remuneration as a key factor for the continual migration, arguing that the monthly pay of an average pharmacist abroad is equivalent to their counterpart’s one-year remuneration in Nigeria.
