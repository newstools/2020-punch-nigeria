Leke Baiyewu, Abuja Two members of the House of Representatives from Imo State on Thursday, defected from the Action Alliance to the All Progressives Congress. The members are Uju Chima Kingsley and Paschal Chigozie Obi. Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma and his predecessor, Senator Rochas Okorocha, had stormed the chamber to receive the defectors to the APC. With the defection, AA now has no member in the National Assembly. The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, read a letter from the members, announcing their defection in plenary. Kingsley, in his letter read by Gbajabiamila, said, “It is with utmost sincerity of purpose and after due consultation with my political followership in my federal constituency in Imo State, that I wish to convey to you my decision to officially defect from my Action Alliance (AA) to the All Progressives Congress (APC)…” The Speaker also read a similar letter from Obi. The Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, who is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, however, raised a point of order, challenging the defections and asking that their seats be declared vacant. Responding, the Speaker said, “I will rule from your point of order. Did you listen carefully to the letters that I read out? The letters clearly stated the reason why they were leaving AA, which is in tandem with the provisions of Section 68 (1). The defectors later addressed journalists in the company of the National Organising Secretary of the APC, Emma Ibediro; and the Imo State governorship candidate of the AA in the 2019 general election, Uche Nwosu.
