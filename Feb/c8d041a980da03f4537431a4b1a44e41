Daud Olatunji,Abeokuta Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested a father, Idowu Sikiru, for  burning the buttocks and mouth of his five-year- old son, Segun Sikiru, for allegedly stealing a piece of cooked fish. The father allegedly used a hot aluminium plate to burn the buttocks and mouth of the child. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this on Sunday  in a statement. Oyeyemi explained that the suspect, who resided in Itowo, in the Oke-Sopen area of Ijebu-Igbo, was arrested following information from neighbours. The PPRO said the police in the Ijebu Igbo division were alerted by members of the public that the suspect was about to kill the son. He said, “On the strength of the information, the DPO Ijebu Igbo division, SP Kazeem Solotan, quickly mobilised his detectives to the area where the suspect was arrested. “Preliminary investigation revealed that the suspect accused the boy of stealing a piece of cooked fish and he put an aluminum plate on fire. When the plate was red hot, he forcefully sat the boy on it, thereby giving the victim serious burns on his buttocks. “He equally used the plate to burn the victim’s fingers and mouth. The victim has been rushed to hospital for medical attention.” Oyeyemi said the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, had ordered the transfer of the suspect to the Anti-Human Trafficking and Child Labour Unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation and possible prosecution.
