Peter Dada, Akure The representative of  House of Ondo East and West  in the House of Representatives, Abiola Makinde, has  said the Africa Democratic Change has no candidate for the  October 10  governorship election in the state. Makinde said this in Ondo town during the  empowerment programme for 600 women in  the Ondo East and Ondo West Local Government Areas of the state. The programme was organised by a non-governmental organisation, the Dr Rhoda Makinde Initiatives. The lawmaker said, “If the ADC would have a candidate in the next governorship election, I don’t know yet but I hope that the ADC would still come out to make Ondo a better place  whereby the impact of good governance would be felt among the people, not that the politicians would continue to enrich themselves. “God is raising new armies of politicians that would make Nigeria a better place and it is starting in Ondo State by the special grace of God.” On the empowerment programme, the ADC chief  said  it would allow women to take their rightful  in  society, urging the beneficiaries to make good use of the items given to them to improve their lives. The  initiator of the programme, Dr Rhoda Makinde, said the programme was created to bring women of diverse economic backgrounds together to educate, inform, and inspire attendees to take charge of their lives and contribute meaningfully to family, community and society at large. Some of the items distributed  were sewing machines, grounding machines, hairdryers, mixers and cash. Copyright PUNCH.
