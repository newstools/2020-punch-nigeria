Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Federal Government’s annual audit report has uncovered financial irregularities of over N896m in the accounts of seven recently established federal universities. The 2017 report from the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation, titled, ‘Auditor-General’s Annual Report on the Accounts of the Federation of Nigeria 2017’, obtained by our correspondent, which indicted the universities for the years 2015 and 2016, recommended that the vice-chancellors of the respective institutions during  years under review be made to answer for the monies unaccounted for. The indicted federal universities are Federal University, Wukari, Taraba State; Federal University, Dutsin-Ma, Katsina State; Federal University, Lafia, Nasarawa State; Federal University, Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State; Federal University, Birnin-Kebbi, Kebbi State; Federal University, Dutse, Jigawa State; and Federal University, Lokoja, Kogi State. They are among the nine federal universities established by former President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration in 2011. For the federal universities in Wukari, Dutsin-Ma, Oye-Ekiti, and Birnin-Kebbi, the report listed irregularities totalling N754m. The report said, “During the periodic check of the Federal University Wukari, for the year 2015 and 2016, the following were observed; One, violation of E-payment policy – payments were made to officers who were not the direct beneficiaries amounting to N17,924,800 in contrast to the electronic payment policy of the Federal Government. “The recommendation is that the vice-chancellor is required to account for the sum of N17,924,800 on account of non-compliance with the above policy.
