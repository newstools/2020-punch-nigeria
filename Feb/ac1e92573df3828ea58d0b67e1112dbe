Ada Wodu, Calabar A serving policeman and five others have been reportedly arrested in connection with the recent spate of kidnappings in Calabar, the Cross River State capital. PUNCH Metro gathered that the policeman, whose identity was not disclosed, was picked up by men of the Operation Skolombo anti-crime squad in the metropolis after at least five kidnap suspects, who were arrested on Sunday, allegedly implicated him. Our correspondent gathered that the suspects and the policeman, who resided at 8 Miles, were being held at the Eburutu Barracks in Calabar. When contacted on the arrest of the policeman and other suspects in connection with recent kidnappings, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, said, “I am not aware. For now, I have not heard anything about that. I have to find out.” Meanwhile, the Nigerian Chronicle account worker, Maurice Archibong,  who was kidnapped last week, has regained his freedom.
