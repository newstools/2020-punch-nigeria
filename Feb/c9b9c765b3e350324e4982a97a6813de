Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Imo State, Basil Duru, has urged Governor Hope Uzodinma to probe the administration of former governor Emeka Ihedioha. Duru, who spoke in Owerri, on Wednesday, noted that it was “unfortunate” that Ihedioha had failed to hand over to Uzodinma “up till now.” He said, “There was no handover note from him to the present administration on the state of affairs in Imo State, relating to the civil service, government house, financial status, etc. before and after he was sacked. “(There was also no) update on his administration’s goals, policies achievements and expenditure.” He further urged the governor to take a look at the projects executed by the state and local governments of the state. According to him, the people of Imo State also deserve to know what happened to donations from foreign donors, monthly allocations from the Federal Government, and internally generated revenue. He said, “Income from these sources accruing to the Imo State Government daily cum monthly runs into hundreds of billions of naira within the seven-and-a-half months (May-December 2019), including the money he inherited from the administration of Rochas Okorocha. “But Ihedioha left office without leaving or accounting for a dime and no project is visible to justify a kobo.” Copyright PUNCH.
