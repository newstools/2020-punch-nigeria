Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The Ebony State Government on Wednesday said it had suspended indefinitely, members of the state internal revenue board over alleged fraud. The government also alleged that it discovered records of monumental fraud in the IGR of the state before it suspended the board members. In a statement issued by Secretary to the State Government, Dr Kenneth Ugbala, the government urged members of the public not to have anything to do with the suspended board members as it concerned IGR collections. The statement said, “All IGR matters are henceforth domiciled in the office of his excellency, the deputy governor of the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
