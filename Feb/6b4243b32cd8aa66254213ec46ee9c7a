Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri A 12-year-old boy, Kasarachi Odurukwe, has reportedly committed suicide in Agboala Ishiala Umudi community, in the Nkwerre Local Government Area of Imo State. PUNCH Metro was told that the victim became frustrated after his parents died. Odurukwe was a primary six pupil of Practicing School, Umudi, until his death. A community source claimed that the boy committed suicide on Sunday by hanging himself with a rope on a bamboo tree near the community’s river. The source explained that the boy and his two younger siblings had lost their parents and were living with an aunt in the village. He said, “Kasarachi (Odurukwe) had been complaining of how boring the world had become to him and he always told his peers that he would one day take his own life. “He would jokingly tell his mates that he wanted to die to meet his mother and father in heaven. “He later led his two siblings and two other children to a nearby stream to fetch water.” On arrival at the stream, Odurukwe was said to have assisted the other children to fill their cans, while he used a long stick to check the depth of the stream. “Because he was not satisfied with the shallow depth of the water, he took a rope and tied it up to a bamboo tree. But his first and second attempts to kill himself failed, while the other kids begged him to stop. “It was the third attempt on a stronger bamboo tree that the rope strangled him. “That action jolted the other kids, who ran back to the village to report to the family and village elders,” the source added. The police spokesperson, Orlando Ikeokwu, had yet to respond to enquiries as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH.
