JUSTIN TYOPUUSU The Taraba Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps has arrested two suspects, Faiza Abdullahi and Nafiu Abubakar, for allegedly extorting money from candidates at illegal Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination centres. The Taraba Commandant of NSCDC, Alhaji Aliyu Ndanusa, disclosed this to newsmen at the corps’ headquarters in Jalingo. According to him, the government approved price for UTME registration was N4, 000 while the two suspects were charging students N4,200 in contravention of the directives of the Federal Government. Ndanusa said the NSCDC would not sit back to allow fraudulent persons to defraud the unsuspecting members of the public. He said the two suspects were arrested following an outcry by Joint Admission and Matriculation Board officials in the state over the activities of unauthorised persons. “Operatives of the NSCDC have been recently trained at a workshop for the purpose of monitoring the registration centres to ensure that they comply with the Federal Government’s directives of N4,000 registration fees for JAMB. “Anybody who adds any amount to this has already contravened the directives and will be made to face the wrath of the law,” he said. Ndanusa said the suspects would be charged after investigation. Copyright PUNCH.
