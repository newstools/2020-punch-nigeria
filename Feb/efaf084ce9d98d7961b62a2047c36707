Toni Ufoh The coach of Remo Stars, Daniel Ogunmodede, has poured encomiums on the late assistant captain of the club, Kazeem Tiamiyu, who was killed by a hit-and-run driver on Saturday while in the custody of officers of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. The late Kazeem, popularly known as “Kaka” was reportedly thrown out of a car by SARS officials along the Sagamu-Abeokuta Expressway, before he was crushed by an oncoming vehicle. Daniel told Sport Extra that the player joined Remo Stars six months ago and was able to gain the respect of his teammates and was made the club’s assistant captain. He said, “When Kazeem joined us six months ago, we saw the qualities in him and in no time, he was made the assistant captain of the club. “He was always the first to arrive for our training sessions and always ready to play in any position for the club whenever the situation arose.” Copyright PUNCH.
