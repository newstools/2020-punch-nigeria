Ted Odogwu, Kano The Kano Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Monday quizzed the Minority Leader of the Kano State House of Assembly, Isiyaku Danja, for alleged abuse of office and misappropriation of N1.5bn meant for constituency projects. The lawmaker’s ordeal started following a petition by the Kano State Government to the commission, alleging the diversion and misappropriation of public funds. In the course of investigation, numerous suspicious payments were allegedly traced to multiple beneficiaries, including some made to Allad Drilling Limited, a company, belonging to the suspect and whose accounts he is the sole signatory. The source said it was also discovered that the funds were withdrawn in cash by the suspect on several occasions. He said, ‘’Interestingly, he is the one to certify that the jobs were done before any payments are made.’’ READ ALSO: Senate alleges NPA job sold for N3m, probes FCC He added that investigation had commenced to discover the beneficiaries of the other suspicious outflows from the account, which is believed to be over N1.5bn.
