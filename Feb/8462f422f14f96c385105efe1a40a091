An Ikeja High Court on Thursday sentenced a former part-time lecturer in the University of Lagos, Akin Baruwa, to 21 years imprisonment for raping an 18-year-old admission-seeker. Justice Josephine Oyefeso, while sentencing Baruwa, described his action as heinous. Oyefeso held that the sentence should serve as a deterrent to others. She said, “The offence committed against this young lady was a violation of her chastity which would have left huge emotional scars from which I pray and hope she will recover.
