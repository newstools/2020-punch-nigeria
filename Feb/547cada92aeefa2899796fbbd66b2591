Maiharaji Altine, Gusau A former governor Abdulazeez Yari has assured the All Progressives Congress supporters in Zamfara State that their houses will never be demolished again by the state government under Governor Bello Matawalle. Recall that the state government had demolished the APC Secretariat in the Maradun Local Government Area and had marked many houses belonging to the APC supporters in the state for demolition. But receiving some APC supporters at his residence in Talata-Mafara on Sunday, Yari warned that if any house was demolished again, Matawalle would face mass protest from the APC supporters. “Let me call on Governor Matawalle to stop demolishing the houses of the APC supporters in the state and if he doesn’t heed the call, he will be held responsible for whatever happens in the state. “I will personally lead a mass protest against Governor Matawalle if he dares demolish any house that belongs to our members and if he thinks I am joking, let him try and see,” said Yari.
