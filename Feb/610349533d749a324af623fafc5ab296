Peter Dada, Akure The immediate past chairman of the All Progressive Congress in Ondo State, Mr Isaac Kekemeke, on Sunday said he was preparing to be the next governor of the state. He also debunked a report that he joined the governorship race in order to become the deputy governorship candidate of the party should the incumbent deputy governor, Agboola Ajayi, dropped from the race . Kekemeke, who spoke with journalists in Akure, the state capital,  said he would defeat Governor Rotimi Akeredolu at the forthcoming primary of the party. According to him, there is no automatic governorship ticket for anyone in the party. He said he joined the governorship race in order to be the candidate of the APC and win the governorship election in the state. He said, “I am not running to become the deputy governor of anybody. Akeredolu did not run inclusive government, but a secluded administration; so I am set to unseat him and become the next governor of the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
