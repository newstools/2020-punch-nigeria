Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested a 60-year-old fish-farmer, Muyiwa Otulayo, for attempting to smuggle substance believed to be hard drug to his detained son, Damilola. Otulayo is currently in the commission’s detention at the Ibadan zonal office. The older Otulayo was on the premises of the EFCC in Ibadan on Monday, February 17, supposedly on a visit to his son. However, while discussing with the son, an officer of the commission noticed that he handed over a sachet of drugs to him. The drug was taken from him and kept as an exhibit. The in-house nurse, who examined the content, confirmed that it was Rohypnol, a tranquillizer, used under strict prescription for the treatment of severe insomnia and assist in anaesthesia. The drug, according to experts, contains high sedative effect and is rarely used except when prescribed by licensed medical officers. The younger Otulayo was recently arrested after a criminal case of money laundering, detected in the United Kingdom, was reported against him. The case, involving the sum of £45,000, was said to be a part of a wider amount (about £500,000) for which he was declared wanted by the London’s Metropolitan Police.

The commission added that the suspect (older Otulayo) would be handed over to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency for prosecution. Copyright PUNCH.
