Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt A Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, on Thursday, directed the Rivers State Police Command to release the result of the autopsy conducted on the corpse of an automobile mechanic, Chima Ikwunado, who died in police custody in December 2019. Justice James Omotosho gave the order and said the autopsy result must be produced before March 10, 2020. The counsel for the police, A. A. Jonah, was in court when the suit instituted by the family of the Chima came up for hearing. The trial judge told the police counsel to ensure that his clients released the autopsy report to the deceasedâ€™s family, otherwise the court would hold Jonah accountable for withholding evidence in the matter. The family of the late mechanic had instituted the human rights suit against the Inspector-General of Police; the Rivers State Commissioner of Police; and the Commander of the Eagle Crack Squad, Mile One, Diobu Division in Port Harcourt, for the failure to release the autopsy result to them. The counsel for the plaintiffs, Princess Lawrence, told the court that the family had gone through a lot to lay hand on the autopsy report, but to no avail. Copyright PUNCH.
