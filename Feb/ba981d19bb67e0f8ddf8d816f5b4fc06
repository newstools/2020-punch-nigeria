Solape Lawal-Solarin New Red Devils signing, Odion Ighalo, feels he and Anthony Martial can form a formidable partnership in Manchester United’s attack. After the Europa League tie versus Club Brugge on Thursday, the former Super Eagles striker was asked about the possibility of him linking up with Martial – with both of his appearances so far coming as a substitute to replace the Frenchman. He said, “That is the decision of the coach. My job is just to work hard every day in training and, when called upon to help the team, I do so. “I have played in the Premier League before, I know what is required. I know you have to be very strong and physical, get to hold some balls up for your team to push forward, so I am working towards that. I am getting better and better. We have good players there. “Unfortunately, (Marcus) Rashford is injured, he is a good striker, sometimes he played from the side, so we will have to cope with that. I am happy whenever I am called upon to do anything, I am ready to go.” Copyright PUNCH.
