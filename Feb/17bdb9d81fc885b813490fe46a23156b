Johnny Edward Moses Simon will be available for selection for FC Nantes for Saturday’s home game against Metz Simon was forced out of his team’s 3-3 draw at Dijon in the first half after he suffered a knock on his knee following a collision with the opposing goalkeeper on Saturday. The winger-turned-striker returned to personal training on Thursday and will join the rest of the squad  after scans showed it was only a minor complaint. “I’m fine and back in training,” he told Sports Extra. Simon has scored nine goals and provided eight assists in 26 appearances across all competitions for Nantes. Copyright PUNCH.
