Daud Olatunji The governorship candidate of the Allied People’s Movement in Ogun State in 2019 elections, Adekunle Akinlade, has called for prayers and support for Dapo Abiodun’s  administration. Akinlade made this plea on Saturday during the 2020 inaugural meeting of the All Progressives Congress in the Ipokia Local Government Area held at the palace of Onipokia. Akinlade had last year announced his return to the APC after he contested on the platform of the APM at the last election. Addressing members of the APC in the local government, Akinlade asked the people of the state to support the present administration with prayers. He said,  “We cannot engage in rivalry, abuses or anything that brings retrogression  to our dear state. “We have to pray for them to succeed, as this is not about differences in party, caucus or ideology but about Ogun State. We have just one Ogun State.” He explained that he had to call for prayers for the present administration because inasmuch as he still wished  to govern the state, he hoped to govern a better Ogun State. He lauded his supporters for their support and love throughout his travail in the last election which ended with the Supreme Court’s verdict that dismissed his petition, urging them to remain united. Also addressing the party faithful, the member representing Ipokia state constituency, Sikirat Ajibola, urged her constituents to endure the challenges facing them over border closure and the ban on  fuel supply within 20km of the border. He  assured them that she was doing her bit to make the Federal Government relax the order. Copyright PUNCH.
