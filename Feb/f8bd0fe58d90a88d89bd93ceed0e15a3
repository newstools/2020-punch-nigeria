Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The High Court of the Federal High Court in Nyanya, Abuja on Thursday sentenced one Obinna Echianu to death for killing an Uber driver identified as Edwin Ali in Abuja on December 26, 2016. Delivering judgment, Justice Peter Kekemeke convicted 42-year-old Echianu for armed robbery and culpable homicide. But the judge discharged and acquitted Echanu’s co-accused, Everly Nnorom, 27,  for lack of evidence. The police had instituted five counts of conspiracy, armed robbery, unlawful possession of firearms and culpable homicide against the two men. However, convicting Echianu of the offences on Thursday, the judge held that the police proved counts of armed robbery and culpable homicide against him beyond reasonable doubt against him. “The first defendant is therefore sentenced to death by hanging on each of the counts,” Justice Kekemeke held. The police had alleged that Echianu and Nnorom, who was acquitted on Thursday, conspired to rob the deceased Edward Ali beside Goza pedestrian bridge, Airport Road, Abuja, at about 7pm on December 16, 2016.
