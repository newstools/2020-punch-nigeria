PUNCH Metro learnt that the victim, Mariam Shobukola, attended De Light International School. Joseph said his school was not affected by the protest and no pupil was injured.

It’s actually an open area, while our school is inside the street. “When we heard about the riot, we quickly shut our gate to secure the pupils. “Later, we heard a schoolgirl had been hit by a stray bullet. We opened our school gate when there was no more tension.” Our corresponent learnt on Monday that Mariam was still receiving treatment for the bullet injuries at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja.
