Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Wednesday sought the buy-in of major stakeholders and other Nigerians in the provision of water service to ensure the success of the regulatory guidelines in the water sector. The governor, who spoke at the 2020 Lagos Water Conference held at the MUSON Centre, Onikan through the Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, stated that the buy-in of stakeholders was essential. He added that his administration’s call on stakeholders was necessary because it was generally accepted that the environmental regeneration programme in the water sector was based on regulatory guidelines and no government at any level could do it alone. Sanwo-Olu noted that the people created problems for themselves with the pollution of sources of clean water, unregulated sinking of boreholes, abuse and non-regeneration of water aquifers, among others. He stressed that these problems were matched only by government’s ability to come up with solutions. The governor expressed the  hope in the forum’s ability to come up with sustainable resolutions for repositioning water governance and regulatory dispensation in Lagos State as a whole. Earlier in his remarks, the Minister of Water Resources, Sulaiman Adamu, said it became imperative for the Lagos State Government and the Federal Government to partner in order to ensure adequate provision of potable water for all citizens at all times.
