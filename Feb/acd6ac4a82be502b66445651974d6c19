The victim’s father, Ibrahim Sani, reported the incident on January 27, 2020, at the Danja Police Station, leading to Husaini’s arrest. According to the police, Sani observed that the victim was walking abnormally on January 26, which prompted him to query her. The victim reportedly revealed that Husaini “who is the headmaster at Alhazawa Primary School, deceived and lured her into the said school classroom and about five times had unlawful carnal knowledge of her.” Husaini is facing a charge for the offence of rape in line with Section 254 of the Katsina State Penal Code Law of 2019.
