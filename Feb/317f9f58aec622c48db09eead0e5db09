Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja The National Salaries Incomes and Wages Commission has developed a five -year strategic plan to enable it to achieve its mandate. The acting Chairman of the commission, Ekpo Nta, said this at a management retreat for the commission. He said for the commission to be successful in achieving its mandate, there was a need for collaboration with major stakeholders in the economy.

The Chairman, Senate Committee on Establishment and public Service, Senator Ibrahim Shekarau, said the mandates of the commission had  become very  strategic in addressing the needs of nation’s work force.
