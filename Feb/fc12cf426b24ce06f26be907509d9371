Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has expressed hope that the Federal Government will refund state resources used to execute federal projects in the state. Wike said his optimism stems from the fact that the Federal Executive Council had sent a verification team to the state in respect of federal projects. The governor spoke on Monday during a courtesy visit by the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, at the Government House in Port Harcourt. He said, “I thank the Federal Government for at least coming to verify our claims. We submitted our claims, while some other states have been paid. But we are hopeful. We believe that by this verification visit, we will get paid.” He said most of the federal projects in question were executed by Dr Peter Odili and the immediate past administration in the state. The governor pointed out that the funds, if paid, would be channelled towards other developmental projects in the state. Copyright PUNCH.
