Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The duo of Samson Adedeji and Nurudeen Lawal, both 19, were on Monday remanded in a correctional centre following their arraignment before an Osun State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Osogbo for wilful and unlawful damage of the perimeter fence of the Baptist High School III, Gbodofon, Osogbo. The police prosecutor, Bankole Awoyemi, told the court that the offences were committed on or before January 28, 2020, at the Gbodofon area. Bankole said the defendants conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace when they wilfully and unlawfully damaged the perimeter fence of the school. The offences were said to have contravened sections 451, 249(1) (d) and 249(3) of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Vol. ll, Laws of Osun State of Nigeria, 2002. The defendants pleaded not guilty to the two counts preferred against them. The counsel representing the defendants, Kayode Ajibola and Julie Olorunfemi, applied for their bail.
