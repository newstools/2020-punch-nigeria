Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The Nigeria Customs Service has said it will hand over the $8,065,612m intercepted at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the suspects for investigation and prosecution. The Comptroller-General of the NCS, Col. Hameed Ali (retd.), said this in Abuja on Thursday when he appeared before the House of Representatives Committee on Finance. Ali told the committee that names were written on the bundles of the cash, which the Customs were investigating. Men of the service had on Tuesday announced the seizure at the E-Wing of the international airport tarmac. The Customs boss had said the cash, which was in $100 denomination, was found sealed in 20 wraps in six Bagco bags and packed in a coaster bus allegedly belonging to the Nigerian Aviation Handling Company Plc. Ali had said one person had been arrested in connection with the money, which was intercepted on January 16, 2020. Chairman of the committee, Mr James Faleke, at the meeting said the House officially commended the NSC for intercepting the cash. Faleke likened the cash to the loot kept by a former military dictator, the late Gen. Sani Abacha, in foreign countries. Copyright PUNCH.
