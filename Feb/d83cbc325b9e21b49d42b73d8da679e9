Friday Olokor, Abuja The deputy governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the November 16 election in Bayelsa State, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, on Tuesday said he did not face any criminal charge in 1990 and had never faced any before. Degi-Eremienyo was reacting to allegations by a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, Miebi Bribena, that he was tried on the grounds of falsification and certificate forgery in 1990. He has issued a one-week ultimatum within which Bribena should retract his comment or face legal action for “character assassination.” The Bayelsa PDP member was said to have made the allegation during a current affairs programme, Focus Nigeria, on the Africa Independent Television. The allegation came barely two weeks after he was sacked by a panel of Supreme Court justices a day before his planned swearing-in. But Degi-Eremienyo, in a statement by his media aide, Ebinimi Omubo, in Abuja, said, “To keep the record straight, it will be recalled that Senator Degi’s victory at the said election Bribena referred to in 1990 was not challenged in any court of law by the candidate (now late Michael Inemo John); Degi has never faced any criminal charge in his career, both in public or private life. “Bribena by this statement should be ready for the worst legal battle of his life as this will model his mind to speak only the truth but not lying for political patronage.” Copyright PUNCH.
