John Charles, Makurdi Ahead of the local government election slated for March 2020 in Benue State, a group, the aegis of Concerned Members of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Otukpo Local Government Area, has protested the purported endorsement of Mr George Alli by the state caucus of the party. Alli, who is contesting the chairmanship of Otukpo with three other aspirants in the area, was allegedly endorsed by the caucus against the wishes of the other LGA party members. The aspirant, who is the Caretaker Chairman of the Otukpo Local Government, was allegedly endorsed by the PDP caucus of the LGA as aired on a local radio station, Joy FM. However, the concerned members, in a joint statement signed by Mr Owoicho Abel, Mr Patrick Ogbole and Inalegwu Ogebe, described the endorsement as a sham. The aggrieved PDP members, who were accompanied by a large number of protesters to the state PDP secretariat, were rebuffed by some youths that stopped them from entering the party office. When contacted, the state PDP chairman, John Ngbede, said, “I was not in the office on Friday and so, no protest letter was given to me in respect of anybody’s consensus candidature. On that note, I can’t comment on anything not yet seen.” Copyright PUNCH.
