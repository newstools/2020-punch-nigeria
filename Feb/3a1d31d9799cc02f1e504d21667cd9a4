Samuel Awoyinfa One of the consumer goods manufacturing companies in Nigeria, Procter & Gamble, says it is supporting the Kebbi State Government on infant mortality reduction drive in the area of child hygiene. The P&G Africa Director for Government Relations and Public Policy, Mrs Temitope Iluyemi, said the company had donated over one million diapers from its Pampers brand. She said the initiative would promote child hygiene in the first 1,000 days of each child. He said this at the Primary Health Centre, Raha in Bunza Local Government of the state, during the flag-off of the partnership programme. Iluyemi added that P&G would support the Kebbi state government’s efforts at reducing infant mortality rate in the state by increasing immunisation in areas with low immunisation rates. She said, “At P&G, we deliver our promise to make everyday life just a little bit better for our consumers. Our brands improve the lives of people in the communities where we live and work. “We believe in being a force for good and a force for growth wherever we operate. As such, our operations touch thousands of lives with economic prosperity and our citizenship efforts in Nigeria touch over five million people. We are grateful for this opportunity to lend our support to the promotion of maternal and child health through increased immunisation and antenatal care programmes in the state.” The Kebbi State Governor, Senator Abubakar Bagudu, represented by the state’s Commissioner for Health, Jafaar Mohammed, thanked Procter & Gamble for the partnership with the state.
