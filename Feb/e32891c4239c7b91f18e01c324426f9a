Olufemi Atoyebi, Abuja The Court of Appeal in Ilorin has upheld the judgment of a  Kwara State High Court sentencing  a former Chairman of the Governing Council of Kwara State Polytechnic, Saadu Alanamu,  to 12 years in prison. A statement on Wednesday by spokeswoman  for the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission, Rasheedat Okoduwa, said Alanamu was nominated  for  the  ICPC board in 2017 but was later dropped following  allegations of corruption. The statement said he had earlier been found guilty of collecting a N5m bribe from a contractor friend of his, Salman Sulaiman, as a reward for the award of  a contract to his (Sulaiman) company. Okoduwa said, “Dissatisfied with the sentence, the former Governing Council chairman approached the appellate court, urging it to quash the judgment of the trial court. “Having listened to the arguments from both the prosecution and the defence counsel, the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the lower court and dismissed Alanamu’s appeal for lack of merit.” Copyright PUNCH.
