Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The House of Representatives Committee on Aviation has met with the management of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and aviation union leaders over the termination of Intelligent Imaging West Africa Limited’s contract as the managers of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport access gate. The meeting was said to have been held on Tuesday headed by the Chairman of the committee, Mr Nnolim Nnaji. The outcome of the meeting has however not been made known. FAAN had on Tuesday terminated the concession of the tollgate of the Lagos airport to its concessionaire following a clash between the agency’s workers and the company on Monday and Tuesday. FAAN workers had on Monday taken over the collection of tolls at the entrance of the MMIA, Lagos, alleging that the firm’s contract with the agency had expired over a year ago. Meanwhile, the Group Head, Human Resources, Intelligent Imaging West Africa Limited, Mrs Sola Audu, in an interview with The PUNCH, appealed to the Federal Government to look into the issue. Audu explained that the contract that was terminated was renewed in 2014 after a five-year term. She said the firm wrote a letter to FAAN prior to the expiration, asking for a renewal in February, 2019 but did not get a response. She said, “The contract expired on February 19, 2019. Prior to that, we wrote to FAAN requesting for a renewal but we didn’t get a response to end the contract.” Audu stated that while the clash was going on FAAN sent a letter to the company terminating the contract with immediate effect.
