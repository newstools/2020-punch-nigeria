Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has partnered the National Youths Service Corps to hold a nationwide march against corruption, saying Nigerian youths must be in the forefront of ensuring transparency. The EFCC said on Thursday that corps members would lead the walk in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, in a rally, which is tagged, ‘Nigerian Youths march against corruption.’ The march is also supported by the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development. At a joint news conference in Abuja, the EFCC acting Chairman, Mr Ibrahim Magu, and the NYSC Director-General, Brig Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, said the rally was aimed at carrying every stakeholder along in the anti-graft war. Magu said, “It will serve as a platform to sensitise and mobilise Nigerian youths to reject the evil of corruption.” The NYSC DG, Ibrahim, said the scheme was mobilising about 350,000 corps members annually, adding that their potential would be tapped for the success of the anti-corruption war.
