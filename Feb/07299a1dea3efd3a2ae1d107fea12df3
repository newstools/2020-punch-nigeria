Samson Folarin The spokesperson for the family, Ademola Daramola, urged the Lagos State Government to recourse to the Customary Law Regulation Selection to the Oniru Chieftaincy signed by former Governor, Sir Michael Otedola, in September 1993. Ogunyemi ruling house of Oniru royal family has asked princes and princess jostling for the vacant Oniru traditional stool not to lose the good virtues of their forefathers. Daramola denied that the family gave up its right to the stool to anyone, adding that the claim was misleading and targeted at tarnishing the family’s reputation. The former occupant of the traditional seat, Oba Abiodun Oniru, died at 82.

Daramola said “We urge all elders, princes and princesses of Iruland to embrace these good virtues at the trying times,” he added. other member of the family, Chief Abayomi Daramola, the Arobadade of Iruland, said the last time the Ogunyemi family produced the Oniru was in 1894.
