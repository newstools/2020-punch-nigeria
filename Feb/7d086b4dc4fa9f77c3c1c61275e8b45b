Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, has warned candidates sitting for the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination to desist from malpractices, as the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board holds mock UTME today. The minister added that the government detested corrupt practices such as admission racketeering, while warning universities and other tertiary institutions to abide by the rules of the Central Admission Processing System established by JAMB. The minister stated this on Monday in Abuja at the opening of the JAMB’s newly-built General Services Department Building at the board’s headquarters in Bwari. Adamu said, “Candidates who are billed to sit for the 2020 UTME are urged to refrain from any form of malpractices as this administration detests all forms of corruption, including examination malpractice and admission racketeering.
