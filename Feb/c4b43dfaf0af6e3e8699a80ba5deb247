Sodiq Oyeleke Manchester United have assigned jersey number 25 to Odion Ighalo, who joined the club for a short-term loan from Shanghai Shenhua. The club made the jersey number known in a tweet to advertise Ighalo’s jersey. Ighalo missed United’s draw with Wolves on Saturday, due to his loan move only being confirmed late on deadline day. But despite the start of the winter break, the 30-year-old was expected to report for training duty on Monday. Ighalo arrived in Manchester from China on Sunday following his transfer deadline-day switch from Shanghai Shenhua. The 30-year-old former Watford star, who grew up as a United fan, joined the Old Trafford club for the remainder of the season as cover for the injured Marcus Rashford. Ighalo turned down another Premier League club to join United and has set his sights on lifting Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s troubled side back towards the Premier Leagues top four. The Nigeria international scored 16 times in 55 Premier League appearances for Watford before moving to Changchun Yatai in January 2017, and then Shanghai Shenhua two years later.
