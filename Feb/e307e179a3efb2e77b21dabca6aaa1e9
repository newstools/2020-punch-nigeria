Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The immediate past governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha, has accused his successor, Hope Uzodinma, of telling lies against him in order to continue as the governor of the state. Ihedioha, in a statement by his media aide, Chibuike Onyeukwu, said Uzodinma was taking credit for the projects of the former governor. The ex-governor insisted that the Supreme Court judgment, which declared Uzodinma as the duly elected governor of the state, was faulty. He alleged that Uzodinma was trying to ambush the Supreme Court by saying the time had elapsed for the apex court to review the judgment which sacked Ihedioha and simultaneously declared his successor as the duly elected governor of the state on January 14. Ihedioha said, “We wish to inform the general public that all the claims made by the senator (Uzodinma) concerning the Supreme Court judgment, the matters arising from it, restoration of pipe-borne water and electricity, as well as payment of all outstanding salaries owed Imo workers, are blatant lies and deliberate distortion of facts, aimed at currying legitimacy. “It is however not surprising to us that Senator Uzodinma has resorted to telling lies to the people of Imo and Nigerians on the true state of affairs in Imo State. “Firstly, we bear no grudge on his statement that the Supreme Court cannot review its January 14, 2020 judgment. That is the extent he knows, in order to sustain his deception and illegitimate government.” Copyright PUNCH.
