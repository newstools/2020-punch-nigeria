Tunde Oyekola The Kwara State Government and the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party have expressed divergent views on the Tuesday’s visit to the state governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, by some top members of the opposition party. The government, in a statement on Wednesday by Rafiu Ajakaye, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, said top leaders of the opposition PDP visited Abdulrazaq on Tuesday and pledged their loyalty to him. Ajakaye said the PDP leaders, including at least six suspended council chairmen, women and some youth leaders, commended the leadership style, humility and other qualities of the governor. But the PDP, in a reaction by its state Publicity Secretary, Tunde Ashaolu, said its members visited the governor in their private capacity. Ashaolu said, “No member of the party had defected to the All Progressives Congress in the state. Members who paid the courtesy visit to the governor are on their own. “Those people had been meeting with the APC in the state from time. They may say they want to decamp, it’s not a big deal to us. And it doesn’t mean that we’ve disowned them. They’ve made personal and voluntary choice. It’s their personal decision.” Copyright PUNCH.
