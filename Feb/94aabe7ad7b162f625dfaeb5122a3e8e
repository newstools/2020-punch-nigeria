Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta Two persons have been reportedly stabbed during a clash between Yoruba and Hausa traders at the Lafenwa Market in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Thursday confirmed the incident, but said there was no death in the crisis. The violence was reportedly caused by the rumoured death of a Hausa trader who was allegedly hacked down by some miscreants believed to be Yoruba. Oyeyemi said four persons had been arrested while eight knives were recovered from them after the bloody clash between the two tribes. The PPRO said, “The violence broke out when some Hausa petty  traders refused to pay the mandatory daily market levy to the market miscreants.” READ ALSO: Four feared dead as drivers, police clash He said the development infuriated the street urchins, who descended on the Hausa traders and stabbed two of them.
