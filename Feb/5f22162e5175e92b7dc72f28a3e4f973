Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The Secretary General of the Arewa Consultative Forum, Mr Anthony Sani, insisted on Thursday that no true Muslim could desecrate Islam in the name for killing human beings for God. The ACF scribe stated this while reacting to the assertion made by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), that 90 per cent of victims of Boko Haram attacks were Muslim. Sani said the insurgents could not be said to be targeting Christians in their terror attacks. He noted that the insurgents’ resort to religion was for strategic reasons meant to attract the gullible as cannon fodder. Sani said though he did not have the exact figures, he agreed that most Boko Haram members were Muslims and from the North-East. He added, “The sect do not target only Christians but also Muslims who they believe are not willing to adhere to their version of Islam, even though we all know Boko Haram is not pursuing any jihad but in search of mundane things like political power.

That was why President (Barack) Obama once made a clear distinction between Islam and Islamic terrorism, which desecrates Islam. “No true Muslim can desecrate Islam by killing people for God, who does not need anybody to kill for Him. I want to believe Boko Haram is a common enemy to all Nigerians.” Copyright PUNCH.
