James Abraham, Jos The Medical and Dental Consultant Association of Nigeria has declared an indefinite strike to press home its demand for the National Universities Commission to withdraw the circular requiring clinical lecturers to acquire a PhD as a condition for career progression in the Nigerian universities. The National President of MDCAN, Prof. Kenneth Ozoilo, announced the strike at a press conference in Jos on Tuesday. The MCAN President said, “The decision of the NUC to embark on this policy direction, without due attention to the consequences and implications is to say the least, embarrassing. “The duplicity and deceit on the part of the NUC in creating the impression of a consensus among stakeholders is even more shocking. At all points in our previous engagements on this issue, the NUC has been in agreement that the PhD should be a personal, voluntary and optional endeavour for academics who so choose, and that its nonpossession would not constitute an impediment to career progression. To proceed to put ink on paper to the contrary is disingenuous. “It is on the basis of the foregoing that we rose from the January Emergency NEC meeting with a resolution to write the NUC withdraw the said circular. “We duly communicated the NUC but sadly, our demand was ignored. “Consequently, we are left with no further choice than to withdraw our services from universities with immediate effect.” Copyright PUNCH.
