ABIODUN NEJO Three persons with hearing impairment who worked with the Special School for the Blind and Deaf in Ikoro Ekiti, Ijero Local Government area of Ekiti State, died in an auto crash on Saturday in the state. Sources said many occupants of the bus sustained varying degrees of injuries during the fatal accident. They said the accident which occurred at Ara Ekiti was caused by brake failure, after which the vehicle ran into a ditch and somersaulted. Sources said about 18 occupants of the bus who were members of the school were going to a burial ceremony at Odo Owa Ekiti, on the invitation of the principal of the school. The source said: “Those who sustained severe injuries had been referred to the Federal Teaching Hospital, Ido Ekiti, while the deceased had been deposited in the morgue of Ijero Ekiti General Hospital.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Mr Sunday Abutu, who confirmed that the accident was caused by brake failure, said inability to get rescuers early increased the fatality level. Abutu said, “The accident involved only one vehicle and the occupants were going for a ceremony. Those injured are being treated in the hospital. “But the majority of the survivors sustained minor injuries and are responding to treatment. The driver is in our custody.” Copyright PUNCH.
