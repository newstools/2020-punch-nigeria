Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja The National Bureau of Statistics will soon begin the National Census of Commercial and Industrial Businesses. The move is aimed at monitoring and evaluating the impact of the current governmentâ€™s economic blueprint, the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan and the Sustainable Development Goals. The Statistician General of the Federation and Chief Executive, NBS, Dr Yemi Kale, said this during a sensitisation workshop on the census. The workshop served as a medium for creating awareness about the census so as to prepare stakeholders towards the type of information that they would be expected to provide. He said the need for the census had become imperative as the country had not conducted any business census since 1999. Kale described the current efforts as commendable as it would help the country have an up-to-date comprehensive list of all establishments in the country. The census would also assist to determine the structure of enterprises in Nigeria by sectors and the spread across the states and all the 774 Local Government Areas. In addition, the NBS boss said the business census would further help to classify businesses into micro, small, medium and large establishments. Kale said the survey was designed to complement other important surveys such as the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, National Nutrition and Health Survey, General Household Survey-Panel, and the Nigeria Living Standard Survey.
