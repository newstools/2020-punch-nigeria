Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi Emirates says it is creating a memorable travel experience for its customers in Nigeria and across its other networks for Valentine’s Day. The airline said it would serve 40 unique Valentine’s Day themed desserts and treats on board and across its network of lounges spread over six continents. “To celebrate the season of love, Emirates’ chefs have created Valentine’s Day desserts for most of its 41 lounges worldwide from February 13 to 15,” the airline said. It added that the seven Emirates lounges in Dubai were also putting on a full Valentine’s spread at the same period while frequent flyers could enjoy a champagne treat. The airline said, “Onboard meals will be seasoned with a touch of romance to complement the regionally inspired cuisine. “On Valentine’s Day itself, Emirates will serve a special selection of desserts on longer flights across its network. “In first and business class, customers can end their meals on a sweet note with a heart-shaped passion fruit cake.” It added, “In the iconic A380 onboard lounge, customers can enjoy a drink while snacking on pastries as well as strawberries dipped in dark and white chocolate, while snack baskets in first class will feature the limited edition strawberry and cream flavoured Lakrids liquorice. “In economy class, customers will be served a white chocolate passion fruit cheesecake for dessert.” Emirates said customers could indulge in the specially created desserts while watching the over 4,500 channels of entertainment across all classes including romantic comedies and classics.
