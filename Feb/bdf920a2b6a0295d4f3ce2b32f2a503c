Ada Wodu, Calabar The Cross River State chapter of the Young Progressives Party, has berated the state House of Assembly for approving a N35bn loan request by Governor Ben Ayade. The approval will enable the administration to obtain the loan from a consortium of three banks. The YPP threatened to occupy the Assembly and the governor’s office if the approval was not reversed. This was contained in a statement jointly signed by Chief Servant of the party, Anthony Attah, and State Secretary, Ogar Oko, in Calabar, on Wednesday. It partly read, “The Finance and Appropriation Committee of the 9th Assembly of Cross River State led by its chairman, Sunday Achunekang (Obanliku) without giving a thought to the untold misery of the state and what the future portends, gave a nod for the state government to take some unhealthy and staggering N35bn loan. “Indigenes of the state are greatly disturbed by this approval. We had thought that the 9th Assembly under the superintendent of Jonas Williams came to salvage us from the grips and claws of debts.” Copyright PUNCH.
