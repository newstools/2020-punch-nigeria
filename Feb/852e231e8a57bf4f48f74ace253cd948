Umar Muhammed, Lafia The Nasarawa State House of Assembly on Wednesday passed the Witness Protection Bill to give witnesses the boldness, confidence and protection to testify in court. Mr. Ibrahim Abdullahi, the speaker of the House, announced the passage of the bill at plenary after Tanko Tunga, the majority leader, moved a motion for the passage. According to him, the bill, if assented to by the governor, would go a long way in curtailing the rate of crime in the state and the country at large. He, however, added that the bill would also give witnesses the opportunity to present evidence, expose and report to the police and other security agencies without fear of molestation. He further explained that the bill would enhance criminal justice in the state and the country at large. The speaker, thereafter, mandated the clerk of the house to produce a clean copy of the bill for Governor Abdullahi Sule’s assent. Tunga, while moving the motion for the passage of the bill, urged his colleagues to support the bill to allow it scale through third reading. The motion was unanimously adopted by members when it was put to a voice vote by the speaker. The sponsor of the bill, Mohammed Alkali, informed journalists that he was delighted with the passage of the bill. His words, “I want to urge the ministry of justice to sensitise the public on the importance of the bill as nobody will be afraid while testifying in court.” Copyright PUNCH.
