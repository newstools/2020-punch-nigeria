Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Commissioner of Police in Bayelsa State, Uche Anozia, has debunked allegations by the immediate past governor of the state, Seriake Dickson, that he provided police protection for the hoodlums who vandalised property in Yenagoa, including Dickson’s private residence, as a result of the Supreme Court’s February 13 judgment. Dickson had on Wednesday while reacting to the apex court verdict, which dismissed the All Progressives Congress’ applications seeking a review of the earlier ruling, accused Anozia of “making it possible for his men to escort hoodlums who destroyed properties including his own, libraries and others.” Violent protest had erupted in different parts of Yenagoa following the nullification of the former state governor-elect, David Lyon, and his deputy, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, for irregularities in his name on his certificates. Anozia said, “With due respect to the office and person of the ex-governor of Bayelsa State, l had worked with him harmoniously and dispassionately. “This particular information is bitter to the taste and repugnant to my hearing. I never did that and will not do so. I do my job basically with the fear of God. I was properly brought up at home.” The Commissioner of Police said the eight suspects arrested in connection with the attacks were being prosecuted. Copyright PUNCH.
