Former Chelsea defender Celestine Babayaro has said that while he welcomes ex-players being involved in Nigeria coaching set-up he questions Joseph Yobo’s credentials. His comments come after his former international team-mate and ex-Everton star Yobo was appointed as assistant coach of the Super Eagles two weeks ago. Babayaro, who won an Olympic gold medal with Nigeria at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, said any such appointment must be backed by requisite qualifications. The duo were in the Nigeria squad at both the 2002 World Cup and two years later at the Africa Cup of Nations in Tunisia “From my point of view as an ex-player I think he is a good appointment probably done in a wrong way,” the 41-year-old, who is now an agent, told BBC Sport. “I’m not sure if he’s got his badges but if you are trying to appoint someone you make sure they’ve got the right credentials before you appoint them. “I don’t care if it’s an ex (player) or whoever, make sure you appoint the right person that knows the job. “Yes Joseph Yobo has been a captain for Nigeria and he has done well if you want to give him that sort of position make sure he gets the right badges. “If he hasn’t got his badges, send him somewhere. It takes a few months or less than a year.
