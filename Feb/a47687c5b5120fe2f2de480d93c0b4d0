Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Chairman, Ekiti State Teaching Service Commission, Babatunde Abegunde, said on Friday that the three teachers accused of sexually molesting their pupils had been dismissed. Abegunde said the commission “followed the due process as laid down by extant rules to avoid miscarriage of justice in arriving at its decision”. According to a statement from his office, the TESCOM chairman made the disclosure at the plenary of the commission, noting that “the erring staff (members) were first queried and interrogated at the school level before repeating the process at the commission. “The three teachers appeared before the commission’s disciplinary committee which after thorough investigation that took it to affected schools and communities, now made appropriate recommendations,” Abegunde stated. Ekiti State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Wale Fapohunda, had last week during a meeting with the state council of the Nigeria Union of Teachers raised the alarm that some teachers in the state were sexually molesting their pupils and threatened that his office would prosecute anybody found wanting. The state police command also on Wednesday confirmed the arrest of three teachers for allegedly having sexual relationship with the pupils who were said to be minors. The statement from TESCOM stated that two of the teachers affected were of the All Souls Grammar School, Ado Ekiti, while the third teacher was of Osi Community High School, Osi Ekiti, adding that they were middle level officers between grade levels 12 and 14.
