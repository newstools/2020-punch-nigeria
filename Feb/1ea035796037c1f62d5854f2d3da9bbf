Samuel Awoyinfa One of the leading retailers across Africa, Shoprite has thrown its weight behind fight against breast cancer by opening four screening stations in Asaba, Onitsha, Abuja and Kano. Other cities are Damaturu and Lagos. In statement made available to reporters, the company said, “Early detection of breast Cancer can save lives; one of which may be yours. Free breast cancer screenings will again be available, this time in all six regions of Nigeria as a result of the long-standing partnership between Shoprite Nigeria and ‘Run For a Cure Africa.” According to the statement, the Big Pink Fight screenings will give women access to clinical breast examinations, ultrasound scans and mammograms. Four of the screening stations will be situated at Shoprite stores in Asaba Mall, Delta state, Onitsha Mall in Anambra state, Novare Gateway Mall in FCT Abuja and Ado Bayero Mall in Kano state. Speaking on the campaign, the Founder/Executive Director of RFCA, Dr Ebele Mbanugo,  said, “The early detection of the disease is a crucial factor in its successful treatment, however, the sad reality in Nigeria is that 75 per cent of breast cancer cases are diagnosed too late, when treatment is prohibitively expensive and survival rates greatly diminished.” Shoprite’s partnership with RFCA dates back to 2014, when they raised awareness of breast cancer by roll-out of free screenings. Some 5,000 women have since benefited from these screenings taking place annually. Copyright PUNCH.
