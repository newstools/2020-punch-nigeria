Anna Okon The developer of the Ijegun Port city, Chief George Igboegwu, has constructed flood control canals to eliminate environmental and other hazards around the community. He also assured residents of the community that the project would bring increased development and job opportunities to the area. Igboegwu, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Westron Properties Nigeria Limited, while speaking during the inauguration of a one-kilometer road and link bridge in the area, acknowledged that the development of the port city was bound to come with some discomfort to the residents. He said, “Our determination is to ensure that we do all we can to eliminate as much of this discomfort as possible. “It is in the light of this that we have assisted with the construction of flood control canals, road and dredging works for the community.” Residents of the area, while welcoming the road construction, had however rejected the siting of tank farms around the community, expressing fears that the community may witness a repeat of the Apapa port scenario.
