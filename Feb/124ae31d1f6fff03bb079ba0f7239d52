…As corporation pays workers 14 years after closure Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has threatened to issue warrants of arrests to ministries, departments, and agencies of the Federal Government that fail to appear before its Committee on Public Accounts. The committee had summoned the MDAs to answer questions on why they failed to submit their audited account to the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation and the queries issued to them by the national auditor. Chairman of the committee, Mr Oluwole Oke, said in Abuja on Monday that such agencies have something to hide, stressing that the House was determined to unravel the reason for their refusal to answer its summons. Oke particularly ordered the Managing Director of the Niger Delta Basin Development Authority, Mr Tonye David-West, to appear before the committee on Tuesday or risk arrest.
