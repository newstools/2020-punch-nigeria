Solape Lawal-Solarin with Agency report Ex Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo’s dream of teaming up with his new teammates in Marbella, Spain on a warm weather training, was shattered owing to Corona Virus fears by the club. The Red Devils were forced to shelve their plans to include the 30-year-old in their Marbella trip because they feared travel restrictions might prevent him returning to England. Ighalo, touched down in Manchester last weekend following his deadline-day loan switch from Chinese side Shanghai Shenhua until the end of the season. The coronavirus has claimed 722 lives and restrictions could be placed on travellers who have been in mainland China within the past fortnight. “Odion will stay in Manchester, because he arrived from China in the last 14 days,” manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told MUTV. “Because of the situation in China, we’re not sure if he’d be allowed back into England if he leaves the country again. “He’s staying here working with a personal coach, individual programme and his family then can settle in England as well. That’s a plus. “Of course he might have liked to have come with the players and get to know them, but with the risk (of potential border restrictions tightening), we don’t want to take that.” Copyright PUNCH.
