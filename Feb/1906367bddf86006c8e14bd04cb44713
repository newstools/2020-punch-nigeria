Femi Makinde The Peoples Democratic Party in Imo State will today  start an eight-day prayer and fast session for the restoration of Emeka Ihedioha as the governor of the state by the Supreme Court. The Secretary of the PDP in Imo State, Emeana Nze, on Saturday announced this in a memo to members of the party in the state. The Supreme Court sacked Ihedioha  as governor of the state in their January 14 judgment and declared  Hope Uzodinma as the rightful winner of  last year’s governorship   poll in the state. To give Ihedioha’s struggle a spiritual boost, the party asked its members to begin prayer and fasting from February 9  to 16 while wearing black attire. The memo  read, “During this period, all ward excos should request Mass in their local churches and assemble at the local government area party secretariats daily at noon for prayer and breaking of fast.” The PDP  urged “Imo people to remain peaceful and prayerful as we await judgment on the review filed by Ihedioha”.
