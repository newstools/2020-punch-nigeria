The parish priest, of the St. Andrew’s Catholic Church, Aruogba, in the Oredo Local Government area of Edo State, Rev. Father Andrew Ihonda-Ovienloba, has said robbers broke into his office and stole a huge amount of money belonging to the church. Ihonda-Ovienloba, who made the disclosure during the Sunday mass at the church, said he woke up to discover the robbery. He added that the robbers did a “very neat job,” indicating that they might probably be people who were familiar with the environment. The priest was quoted as saying by the News Agency of Nigeria, “Forty days after the birth of Jesus was celebrated all over the world, robbers broke into my office and stole the money belonging to the church. “The money they stole was the money the poor people, who have one problem or another, used to sow seeds and offer petitions to God. “Automatically, the robbers have succeeded in carrying the problems and challenges of those who offered the money to God for prayers. “You cannot rob a house of God or a man of God and go scot free. When you rob a house of God, you carry all the suffering and pain of the congregation.” During the prayer of the faithful, the priest, however, prayed for the robbers to repent.
