His trekking to Kano from Katsina is a testimony of his satisfaction with this administration’s commitment to do the needful in actualising its mandate for the good people of Kano.” Batsari said he trekked because Ganduje was dedicated to his people.

Ganduje is a man who carries the youth along to ensure good governance.” Copyright PUNCH.
