Toni Ufoh Kano Pillars defender Chris Madaki is confident the Sai Masu Gida will compound the woes of Enugu Rangers by recording a win when they both clash in a rescheduled match in the Nigerian Professional Football League on Wednesday (today), Sports Extra reports. Rangers have been inconsistent this season, winning only five of their 18 NPFL games. They also recorded five draws and six defeats. Seasoned NPFL defender Madaki stated that no amount of threats from the Flying Antelopes camp would intimidate them, saying they were fully ready for the encounter. “We have heard a lot from Enugu Rangers camp regarding the game,” Madaki told Sports Extra. “The good thing is that football is played with legs and not by spoken words, we shall be ready for them. “Kano Pillars will play as a unit and the spirit is very high in the camp. The boys are ready for the game.” On fans violence in Umuahia after the Abia derby incidence on Sunday, Madaki added, “Rangers are a professional side and we (Pillars) are too. We are expecting to have a good game tomorrow (today), so I don’t expect violence if we win in Enugu.” Rangers are 17th in the NPFL table with 20 points after 16 matches, while Pillars occupy the eighth position with 27 points after 18 matches played.
