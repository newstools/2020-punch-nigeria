Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja A former governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha, on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to set aside its January 14 judgment that sacked him and declared Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress the duly elected governor of the state. Ndukwe Nnawuchi, SAN, who served as the state Attorney-General during Ihedioha’s short-lived administration, disclosed this to journalists in Abuja on Wednesday.

He said, “The election of March 9, 2019, was challenged in the election tribunal where the judgment was delivered in Ihedioha’s favour.
