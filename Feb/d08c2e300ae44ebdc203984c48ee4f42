Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Police Command on Thursday confirmed the death of two policemen, who were killed by gunmen in the state. Our correspondent gathered that the bandits met the policemen at a checkpoint along Ode Irele-Ajagba Road, in the Irele Local Government Area of the state on Monday and opened fire on them, killing two and injuring one. The injured cop was said to have been rushed to a hospital in the area. However, the identities of the deceased cops were not revealed by the command. The state Police Public Relations Officer, CSP Femi Joseph, who confirmed the incident on Thursday, said the command had launched a manhunt for the culprits. He said, “We lost two of our men on duty on Monday, but we don’t know who their killers are yet. “It is very sad and unfortunate for the command, losing our men just like that. We will do everything to get the bandits to face the wrath of the law.” However, a source identified the killers as militants who had been terrorising the riverine area in recent times. Another source said the killers were armed robbers, who shot the policemen while escaping from a robbery operation. Copyright PUNCH.
