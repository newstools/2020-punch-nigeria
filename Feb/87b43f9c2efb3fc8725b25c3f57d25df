Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State House of Assembly on Tuesday expressed worry over the influx of commercial motorcyclists into the state. It was learnt that the influx was occasioned by the recent ban on commercial motorcycles and tricycles riders in neigbouring Lagos State. The State House of Assembly unanimously called for a detailed profiling of motorcyclists in the state. Leading the debate on a motion, the Chairman, House Committee on Transportation, Oludaisi Elemide, expressed concerns over the operations of the commercial motorcycle and tricycle operators. The lawmakers passed a resolution at plenary calling on the state government to set the machinery in motion towards creating a database to regulate all of their activities with a view to forestalling any threat to the state’s security. Earlier, the Special Adviser to Governor on Public Communications, Remmy Hassan, in a statement said the state would work with the various transport unions to regulate the okada operations. Hassan said, “The first step is for the security agencies in the state to work with the unions to get information about new operators in the state. The step two is for those security agencies on their own to begin to profile people in certain locality. “The third layer is to work with the Community Development Associations, and those CDAs to some extent have a fair knowledge of residents of their community and of course they know their residences.” Hassan explained that a security council meeting was held last week Monday, adding that the challenges of the influx prompted the meeting. He said, “I am sure it was because of that the emergency security meeting was called.” Copyright PUNCH.
