A 70-year-old teacher, Tom Miller Privet, was arrested and charged for allegedly having sex with a 17-year-old student in his classroom ‘ every day’ for three months at Terra Environmental Research Institute Magnet School. According to Metro.UK, Police had reported that Privett, who was a history and government teacher at the school for 30 years, reportedly groomed the girl for years before taking her virginity in the classroom. According to prosecutors, he began to touch the girl inappropriately in his world history class in 2012. ‘These touches began as rubbing her arms while in class, then rubbing her back, and continued to kiss her on the head, cheek and partial lips,’ Detective Ismael Castill wrote in an arrest warrant. The girl went to police in December to report the case. To help investigators obtain evidence, she called Privett to discuss their sexual relationship as police listened. The conversation reportedly confirmed the girl’s claims. Privett was no longer teaching at the school when he was arrested. Prosecutors fear the teacher may have more victims. Anyone with information regarding the accusation levelled against Privett is urged to contact the State Attorney’s Office.
