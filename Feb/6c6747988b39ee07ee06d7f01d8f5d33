Dele Ogunyemi, Warri Over 50 suspected cultists and yahoo boys were rounded up from their hideouts in Delta communities on Thursday night by officers of ‘Operation Delta Safe’ led by CSP Anieteh Eyoh. The arrests were made at different locations including brothels in the Udu Local Government Area of the state following a tipoff after series of rival cult clashes and killings in the area. The state Commissioner of Police, Mr Mohammed Inuwa, who confirmed the arrests, said the police would not relent in their efforts at ridding the state of criminals. Inuwa, who spoke in a telephone interview with our correspondent, said the suspects were arrested over cult-related clashes in the area. He said, “I felt I should send a team to deal with the menace. We will not relent in dealing with the problems of cultism. We will continue to wage war against cultists because we will not tolerate a situation whereby they take delight in injuring and killing themselves.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
