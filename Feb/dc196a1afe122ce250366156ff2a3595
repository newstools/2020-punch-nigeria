Tony Okafor, Awka The decomposing body of a 70-year-old man has been discovered in a locked up apartment in Awka, the Anambra State capital. PUNCH Metro gathered that the man must have died some days back unknown to anybody. A resident of the area, who spoke with our correspondent on condition of anonymity, described the deceased as a social man. The resident stated, “He was a very jovial man. But for about a week, I didn’t see him, only to hear that he died in his apartment. The man was a good man. “The last time I saw him, he was not looking quite good as he was pale.” The state police command, in a statement by its spokesperson, Haruna Mohammed, confirmed the incident. Mohammed gave the name of the deceased as Ignatius Anaekweze. He stated, “On February 1, 2020, around 9.30am, one Onyedika Nwankwo of Umueneche Villa, Awka, reported at the Central Police Station, Awka, that on January 31, 2020, he perceived an unusual odour oozing out from one of the rooms in his house upstairs and traced it to the room of one Ignatius Anaekweze, aged about 70 years and of the same address and also a co-tenant in the house. “The odour prompted him to call on neighbours, who assisted to open the door, whereupon they saw the decomposing body in the room. “Police detectives from the CPS Awka led by the DPO visited the scene and confirmed the incident. “Photographs were taken and the corpse deposited at the Amaku Hospital mortuary for autopsy. No implement of violence was seen or observed and no foul play is suspected from a critical analysis of the crime scene.” Copyright PUNCH.
