Kayode Oyero US President Donald Trump has said his political foes “should be ashamed of themselves”. Trump said this in a live address on Thursday while delivering a victory statement at the White House. He said, “We’ve been going through this for over three years. It was lies and they should never happen to another president. It was a disgrace. It was a disaster and we caught them in the act. If this happened to President Barack Obama, many people would have been in jail right now.” The PUNCH reported that the US Senate acquitted Trump of his impeachment trial on Wednesday.

They should be ashamed of themselves. “They knew that we are totally innocent but they kept it going forever for political gains. “They thought Hilary Clinton was going to win but it never happened. “They said the worst things about me. They took an oath that would be fair but they were not fair. They said the most horrendous things about me. They tried to replace me but I think they should be voting. “Democrats are lousy politicians. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. And she wanted to impeach me a long time ago when she said, ‘I prayed for the president. She doesn’t pray. She may pray but she prays for the opposite’. “Think of what we could have done if the same energy was put into infrastructure. And I’m talking about both sides. If we have both geniuses because they are also geniuses on the other side. Instead, I have just learnt a new phrase; it’s called ‘Total acquittal’. “I have beat them all my life and I will beat them again. Today is the day to celebrate.”
