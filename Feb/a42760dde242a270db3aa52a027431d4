Nike Popoola Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission will partner the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council to prosecute corrupt public officials to improve the country’s business climate, and secure reforms through criminal investigation and prosecution of public complaints. He said the ICPC would carry out such prosecution where necessary. Osinbajo said this during the meeting of the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Monday. “Specifically, complaints from Nigerians regarding activities and practices in Ministries, Departments and Agencies bordering on suspected corruption and deliberate stalling of reform efforts would now be referred from the REPORTGOV.NG portal of PEBEC to the ICPC for investigation and prosecution,” he stated. Osinbajo noted that collaboration between PEBEC and the ICPC was an important step in achieving the FG’s reform agenda, especially regarding all government MDAs regulating business environment responsibilities, thereby ensuring a more condusive environment for businesses in the country. He stated, “I think that if this collaboration is robust enough, we will be able to kill two birds with one stone; first is improving our Ease of Doing Business, second is our anti-corruption ranking internationally, because some of the ranking is a perception index. So, people are simply asked, what is your perception about corruption in Nigeria? “So, if we work on these issues, we can really do a lot in terms of improving the image of the country, not just in the Ease of Doing Business rankings, but also in terms of perception of corruption.” Copyright PUNCH.
