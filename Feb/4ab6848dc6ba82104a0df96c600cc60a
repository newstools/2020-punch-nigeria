Onyekachukwu Meluwa The Governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa, has emerged as the new Chairman of the South-South Governors’ Forum. Okowa succeeded the immediate past Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, who completed two terms in office on Friday, February 14. The Delta governor was selected after elaborate consultations by governors of the Peoples Democratic Party in the region. A statement by Dickson’s Special Adviser on Public Affairs, Mr Daniel Alabrah, reads, “Dickson called on the governors to extend the same cooperation to his successor. “The forum can only collectively proffer solutions to the myriad of challenges confronting the South-South region if the governors work as a team.” Copyright PUNCH.
