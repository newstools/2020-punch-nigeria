The impeachment of the former Deputy Governor of Kogi State, Simon Achuba, has been declared null and void by a State High Court in Lokoja. Achuba was in October 2019 impeached by the State House of Assembly. But Justice John Olorunfemi on Wednesday faulted Achubaâ€™s removal from office, describing it as a violation of the Constitution. The judge, while delivering the judgment, also said the nomination of Edward Onoja as the deputy governor did not follow due process.
