Chidibube Okeoma, Owerri The lawmakers at the Imo State House of Assembly have vacated the assembly complex located at new Owerri in the state capital. The lawmakers relocated to the Ikemba Ojukwu complex in new Owerri, where they held plenary on Tuesday. The Speaker, Collins Chiji, said the lawmakers would remain at Ikemba Ojukwu, until the main complex was completely renovated. The PUNCH reports that the complex was already caving in and risked collapse. The state government had captured the renovation of the complex in its 2020 budget. The complex was renovated in 2014 when late senator Benjamin Uwajumogu was the speaker of the state House of Assembly. Copyright PUNCH.
