Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi Domestic carrier, Aero Contractors, said it has engaged Indian software firm, Ramco, on the automation and expansion of its Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul facility in Lagos. The Managing Director of Aero, Capt. Ado Sanusi, said the partnership would cost the carrier N200m over a period of five years. Sanusi explained that Ramco, a Chennai, India-based Information Technology firm, would be bringing its expertise to automate the processes of Aero MRO facility which he said had carried out repairs on over 20 aircraft in Nigeria and West and Central Africa since it began operations in 2017. He stated that while the partnership commenced July 2019, the airline’s MRO operations went live in December. “By implication, every aspect of the airline’s MRO services can now be accessed and tracked real time for enhanced efficiency,” he said. According to Sanusi, as the MRO’s services increased in scope with more third-party equipment, it became necessary to have improved streamlining of operations through digitilisation. The General Manager, Africa, Europe and Middle East Ramco, Menaka Sinha, said the software, a fully web-based application, had been developed specifically for the aviation industry. Copyright PUNCH.
