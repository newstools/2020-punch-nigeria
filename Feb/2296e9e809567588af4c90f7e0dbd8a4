According to him, NOTAP was important in the Federal Government’s quest for technological transformation in the country. He further advised that NOTAP to use the patents generated by its services to improve the country’s economy. The Permanent Secretary, Mohammed Umar, expressed satisfaction with NOTAP for recording several achievements with little resources.
