‘Tosin Oluwalowo Queen Uboh-Idris has failed to give reasons for her resignation as the President, Nigerian Para-Powerlifting Federation. Speaking with our correspondent on Sunday, Uboh-Idris, who announced her resignation at the end of the 2020 Para-Powerlifting World championship, which took place in Abuja, said she would address the press on Monday (today). “I will be addressing the press tomorrow (Monday) by 4pm to state my reason, for now, I cannot say anything,” she told The PUNCH. The NPPF had been enmeshed in crisis, with athletes staging a protest in Lagos last month over the exclusion of junior lifters from the competition. The Minister of Youth and Sport Development, Sunday Dare, waded into the crisis, calling all warring factions to remain calms, as all issues would be resolved. Uboh-Idris had also in an interview on Channels TV, accused of wanting her to share funds raked from sponsors. Copyright PUNCH.
