Sunday Aborisade,  Abuja The family of Alhaji Mukhtar Idris, who was the governor-elect of Zamfara State, sacked by the Supreme Court in 2019, has petitioned the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), accusing Governor Bello Matawalle of persecution. Idris was declared winner of the Zamfara State governorship election in 2019 before his victory was upturned by the Supreme Court few days to his inauguration. His family members in the petition accused Matawalle of planning to demolish a property belonging to the politician in Gusau, the Zamfara State capital. The petition read in part, “Late last year, an unknown name alleged to be a member of our family was mentioned in a ghost workers’ scam in a bid to tarnish our good name which we refuted and demanded apology. “Now our family house and a mosque built over 40 years ago by our late father has been marked for demolition by the Zamfara State Government. “We are forced to use this medium to highlight our plight because we see it as a dangerous pattern of political persecution being adopted by governors in this political dispensation. “Our family has strived and immensely contributed to the growth of the state but now being victimised for having a member of our family belonging to the All progressives Congress, a political party different from Governor Matawalle’s party, the PDP. “ Your Excellency, on behalf of our family members and all Nigerians by the virtue reposed on you as the leader of all citizens, we call on you to kindly counsel all governors in the country to treat their populace with just and fairness irrespective of party affiliation as you have always demonstrated while relating with them.” Copyright PUNCH.
