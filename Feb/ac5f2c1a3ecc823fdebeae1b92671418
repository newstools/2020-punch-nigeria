However, upon entering the council chambers, Monguno first sat two seats away from Kyari. But, he later moved closer to Kyari, after the CoS beckoned on him to move closer to his seat, leaving only one seat in between the two. The seat in between the two is for the Head of Service of the Federation, Mrs Folasade Yemi-Esan. The PUNCH reported that Monguno did not attend last week’s FEC meeting, coming just days after a memo he wrote complaining that Kyari interfered with security decisions, was leaked online.
