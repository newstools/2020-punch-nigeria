Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, said on Sunday that his survival at infancy was uncommon favour as his parents never knew he would survive. Fayemi, who said his parents named him Folorunso, meaning ‘left in God’s care’ because they were not sure he would survive the childhood stage, expressed gratitude to God on his 55th birthday celebration. The governor, who spoke at the Government House during a special thanksgiving service and reception to mark his 55th birthday celebration, said, “I give God all the glory for giving me uncommon favour. It is uncommon because my parents never knew I could survive infancy. “They had lost two children in quick succession and that was why they named me Folorunso. My parents just thought they should just wait and see the outcome and today I am celebrating 55, I give God all the glory.” The governor said the essence of the birthday celebration was to give glory to God, adding that he is a beneficiary of God’s generosity.
