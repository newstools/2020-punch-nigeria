Solape Lawal-Solarin Nigerian legend, Nwankwo Kanu, believes the new Red Devils’ acquisition, Odion Ighalo, can fill the void left by Romelu Lukaku. The Red Devils were short in the striking department when Lukaku joined San Siro giants, Inter Milan, last summer. And a long-term injury to Marcus Rashford then left Manchester United with no option but sign Ighalo from Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua on loan. The 30-year-old’s move has come under serious scrutiny, but former Arsenal and West Brom star Kanu backs his compatriot to excel at Old Trafford and fill Lukaku’s void. “Yes he can replace him (Lukaku),” Kanu told Goal. “If you watch him play, you’d find out that he is strong and can score goals. “What he needs is the service. In this team, I am sure his game will improve because the team has great players. “Despite playing in the Chinese league, Ighalo is not a player you would look down on and say he is not a good player. “I believe in him and I know he can deliver if given the chance. Bringing him to Old Trafford means that those in the club believe in his ability, and we have to respect that. “I don’t think he will not disappoint because he will give them value for their money.” Copyright PUNCH.
