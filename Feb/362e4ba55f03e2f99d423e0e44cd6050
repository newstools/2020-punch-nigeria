Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna After the payment of N8m ransom, bandits suspected to be kidnappers have released two children in Kaduna State. They were the children of a Kaduna-based medical doctor, Philip Ataga. They were kidnapped along with their mother at Juji community, Cjukin Local Government Area of the state on Friday, January 24, 2020. The kidnappers killed the mother during a negotiation on N120m ransom they demanded. The abductors thereafter demanded N20m to set the two minors free from their den. A source told our correspondent that the two kids were reunited with their devastated father on Thursday night. The source said, “It was an unfortunate incident. After killing the woman, the kidnappers still demanded N20m to free the children. The doctor eventually parted with N8m to get his children. It is that bad. “It is unfortunate we find ourselves in an unsecure environment at the moment. We have cried out on several occasions for the security of lives and property of our community. No one would listen to us but when it is time for elections, you find them coming around to canvass for votes. Nowhere is safe.” The Kaduna State Police Command as of the time of filing this report had yet to confirm the release of the children. The State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP, Yakubu Sabo, simply told our correspondent, “I can’t talk please.” Copyright PUNCH.
