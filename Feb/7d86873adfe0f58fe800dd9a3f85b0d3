The Chief Executive Officer, Gazprom Neft, Alexander Dyukov, said on Wednesday that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, led by Russia, should respond to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak and decide on quotas later on. “Of course, it will probably be necessary to react, but I think that it would be more appropriate to respond to the situation a bit later on because at the moment there is a lot of uncertainty and a lot of conflicting information,” Dyukov said in an interview with the Russia 24 TV channel. Russia has yet to state an official position on making any changes to the current OPEC+ agreement, according to S&P Global Platts. The group will meet March 5-6 in Vienna to discuss market conditions and the future of the deal. Saudi Arabia has lobbied to deepen the 1.7 million barrels per day production cut to offset the coronavirus outbreak’s impact on demand, but Russian officials have yet to commit to any changes. Dyukov added that while the situation was deteriorating in countries such as South Korea and Italy, data from China indicated they had managed to slow down the pace of the spread of the epidemic. “But in any case, not so much time has passed…something happens every month on the oil market and if OPEC+ reacts to changes every month this will only lead to destabilisation of the situation. Therefore it’s better to observe and probably decide on quotas a little later,” he said. In mid-February representatives of Russian oil companies indicated that they supported an extension of the OPEC + production cuts through to the end of the second quarter, but at current production levels rather than with any deeper cuts. Russian producers are splitting the country’s 300,000 bpd cut quota proportionally, but have repeatedly expressed concerns about the impact of complying with the deal on their longer-term development plans and market share.  ­
