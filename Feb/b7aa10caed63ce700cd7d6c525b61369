Matthew Ochei, Asaba Gunmen have shot dead a director in the Delta State Ministry of Works, J. O. Onochie, in Illah, Oshimili North Local Government Area of the state. PUNCH Metro gathered that the director was shot on Sunday at his uncompleted building site in IIlah by the gunmen, while his driver, who was also shot, is receiving treatment at the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba. An official of the ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told our correspondent that the incident had thrown the ministry into mourning. “It is a sad news; a director in our ministry, Onochie, was shot dead yesterday (Sunday). He went to the site of his house in his village and a group of boys started pumping his car with bullets and he was shot dead. Maybe he was trailed to the site,” the official said. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, who confirmed the incident, said the director and his driver were shot but the latter did not die. “Yes, the man (Onochie) was shot dead, but his driver is receiving treatment at the FMC.

Onovwakpoyeya added that the police were determined to fish out Onochie’s killers even though no arrest had been made, adding that investigation was ongoing with a view to bringing those responsible for the killing to justice. At the ministry, workers were seen mourning the death of Onochie, who was described as a good man while he was alive. Copyright PUNCH.
