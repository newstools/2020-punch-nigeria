Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri Serving and past lawmakers of the Imo State House of Assembly on Tuesday urged the state government to immortalise the late senator Benjamin Uwajumogu, who until his death on December 18, was representing Imo North Senatorial District in the Senate. Several lawmakers who spoke during a valedictory session held in honour of the late senator inside the chamber of the state House of Assembly in Owerri, eulogised Uwajumogu for his “uncommon contributions to the development of the state.” In his address, Senator Samuel Anyanwu said the era of Uwajumogu as the speaker of the state House of Assembly between 2011 and 2015 brought uncommon transformation to the state. Anyanwu, who served in the house when the deceased was speaker, said, “Immortalising Uwajumogu by the state government is the right to do.” The member representing Ehime Mbano state constituency, Emma Nduka, said Uwajumogu would be missed for his positive contributions to the state. Simeon Iwunze who represented Isiala Mbano state constituency during the same period, urged the state government to rename the Imo State College of Education, Isienweke, after the late senator. Iwunze recalled that as a speaker, Uwajumogu played an important role in the establishment of the college. Copyright PUNCH.
