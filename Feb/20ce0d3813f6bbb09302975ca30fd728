Manchester United forward Odion Ighalo will be in the squad for Monday’s Premier League game at Chelsea, says manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Ighalo missed the club’s training camp in Spain due to fears the coronavirus outbreak may have led to him being refused entry back into the UK. The Nigerian, 30, joined United on loan from Shanghai Shenhua on 31 January. “We want to integrate him as quickly as we can because he is desperate to play for us,” Solskjaer said. “He is going to travel with us [to Stamford Bridge]. We will just see on his fitness work this week and I think we will get him sharp.” READ ALSO: Boxers no longer afraid of Joshua –Fury The former Watford forward moved to the Chinese Super League in 2017, first with Changchun Yatai.
