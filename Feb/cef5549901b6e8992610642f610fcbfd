Friday Olokor, Abuja A group of Nigerians has staged a protest at the premises of the Nigerian High Commission in the United Kingdom, calling on the British government to put pressure on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to secure the release of Leah Sharibu. During the protest, which followed a prayer session, a petition with 12,132 signatures was lodged by Rebecca Sharibu, with a member of the UK Parliament, Baroness Caroline Cox, calling on the Nigerian government to take action to secure her daughter’s freedom. The protesters led by the Executive Director of International Organisations for Peace and Social Justice, Pastor Ayo Adedoyin, carried placards with inscriptions such as ‘Two years in captivity, negotiate her release now’, ‘held because of her faith, Free Leah’, and ‘Still here, still waiting for action’. The PUNCH reported that Leah Sharibu was one of the 110 female students of Government Girls’ Science and Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State, who had been held in captivity since February 19, 2018, by Boko Haram terrorists on account of her Christian faith. The spokesperson for the Sharibu family and senior lecturer in the Department of Political Science at the University of Jos, Dr Gloria Samdi Puldu, shared the details of the protest, including videos and photographs to The PUNCH on Wednesday night. According to her, the protest was to commemorate the two years of the abduction of Leah Sharibu by Boko Haram insurgents. The UNIJOS don, who is the Executive Director of Leah Foundation, said Rebecca Sharibu pleaded with the UK authorities to “put pressure on President Buhari who was visiting their country to fulfil the promise he made to her to bring home Leah and all others in captivity.” She said, “February 19 marks two years of the abduction of Dapchi girls and Leah Sharibu the only remaining girl in captivity turns two years in captivity. Rebecca Sharibu is with me at present in the United Kingdom to appeal to the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, to put pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari to fulfil the various promises that he had made to secure Leah’s release on several occasions. “Rebecca met with Baroness Caroline Cox on February 18 who assured her that she will take her message to UK Parliament.
