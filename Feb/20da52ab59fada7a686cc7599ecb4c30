Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State Government has warned the  okada riders dislodged from  the major Lagos  roads  to steer clear of the state. The  Special Adviser to the Governor  on Public Communications, Remmy Hazzan, said this in a statement on Wednesday. The government  was reacting to a statement attributed  to the Chairman, Caretaker Committee on Transportation in the state,  Femi Adeniyi, who was on Monday reported to have assured the Lagos motorcyclists that they would be welcomed in Ogun Hazzan  said nobody had been authorised to speak on the issue on behalf of the government. He said the state did not have the capacity to cope with the security challenges the influx of the okada operators from Lagos would pose. Hazzan said  using  motorcycles for commercial operation was not in the schedule of the National Transportation Policy. The special adviser  said only  genuine businessmen and foreign investors would be  received by the state. Copyright PUNCH.
