’Femi Asu with agency report The US Energy Information Administration has forecast global oil market demand fundamentals to tighten this year, largely due to the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak in China. The virus, which originated in the city of Wuhan in central China, has already contributed to a sharp decrease in demand for crude, driving oil prices to bear-market territory. “EIA expects that travel restrictions in response to the coronavirus, along with the related economic slowdown in China, will reduce petroleum demand and keep crude oil prices below $60 per barrel through the first half of this year despite current disruptions to crude oil supply,” EIA Administrator Linda Capuano, said in a statement. In its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook released on Tuesday, the EIA forecast global oil supply to continue to outpace demand this year, but lowered its forecasts for both production and consumption, according to S&P Global Platts. The EIA now forecasts total global liquids supply to average 101.97 million barrels per day in 2020 and total demand to average 101.74 million bpd, a 230,000 bpd gap. Last month, the EIA forecast total supply to average 102.37 million bpd and demand to average 102.11 million bpd, a 260,000 bpd difference. “EIA expects these oil consumption effects will be concentrated in China, but some effects will show up in other countries as well,” the EIA said in the report. The EIA cut its outlook for China’s liquid fuel demand to 14.8 million bpd between February and April, down 400,000 bpd from last month’s outlook. “Jet fuel demand is likely to fall because of travel restrictions and demand for other oil products is likely to fall because of lower economic growth,” the EIA said. EIA forecasts Brent spot prices to average $61.25 per barrel in 2020, down $3.58 from last month’s forecast, and WTI spot prices to average $55.71 in 2020, down $3.54 from last month. “The lower price forecast reflects EIA’s expectations of slower growth in global petroleum and liquid fuels consumption in 2020,” it said. The EIA said the implied volatility of crude prices in early February increased to their highest levels since September 2019 as premium for options contracts increased due to the uncertainty over global economic growth and supply disruptions in Libya. The agency cut its 2020 forecast for production from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries by 260,000 bpd based on additional supply cuts expected between March and May, concerns of global demand growth, and recent supply outages in Libya. The EIA now expects OPEC production to average 28.93 million bpd in 2020 and 29.21 million bd in 2021. It expects OPEC to make cuts of 500,000 bpd from March through May, in addition to the cuts it announced in December 2019, in response to lower global demand in early 2020, including from travel restrictions related to the coronavirus outbreak. The EIA estimates Libyan production fell to 780,000 bpd in January, from 1.15 million bpd in December, as unrest in the country shut export terminals. The outages became more severe in late January, and the EIA estimates Libyan production fell below 200,000 bpd in the first week of February. According to the report, OPEC is expected to limit production through 2020 and 2021 to target relatively balanced global oil markets. Copyright PUNCH.
