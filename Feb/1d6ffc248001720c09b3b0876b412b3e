Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, has condemned those who criticised him for showing off his four wives and 27 children on the floor of the chamber. According to him, his father, who died in 2019 at 86, was survived by 40 children, one of whom was a four-year-old. On January 29, 2020, Ado-Doguwa was among the six new members who were sworn in after winning reruns declared by courts. The ceremony had become dramatic when Ado-Doguwa had spent about one hour to thank the leadership and members of the House, the All Progressives Congress and his four wives and 27 children, some of whom were in the chamber. Speaking with the leadership of the House Press Corps, Ado-Doguwa said, “My father left behind over 40 kids. He died only last year. Among the children he left, one of them is less than four years old. “As far as I’m concerned, as a Muslim, it is not I who caters for them, God caters for everyone, He only uses human beings as agents. And I’m glad that God is using me as His agent to feed my entire family, to train them and take them to good schools which I’m doing.” Copyright PUNCH.
