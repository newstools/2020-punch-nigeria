Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja A Bill for the amendment of the establishment Act of the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency wants 0.5 per cent of the operating funds of oil companies in the country set aside to address oil spills. The NOSDRA Establishment Act Amendment Bill 2018 was passed by both chambers of the 8th National Assembly, but was declined assent by the President, Maj. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Stakeholders in the environmental sector and the oil industry deliberated on the reasons given for the decline of assent by the President at a workshop in Abuja on Thursday. Various speakers at the event pointed to differences between NOSDRA and the Department of Petroleum Resources as a major factor in the failure to pass the bill into law since the amendment process started in 2011. The Director General of NOSDRA, Idris Musa, debunked insinuations that the amendment would result in the agency taking over DPRâ€™s responsibilities. Concerns that the bill also undermined the powers of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources were among the reasons given for the decline of assent by Buhari. Musa also dismissed the concerns. Highlighting some provisions in the bill, Musa said the amendment was seeking the establishment of an Oil Pollution Management Trust Fund, which would be funded with 0.5 per cent of the operating funds of the oil companies. The Minister of Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, said there was a need to conduct an environmental audit in the country. The minister, who decried the hazardous effects of oil spills on the environment, called for the standardisation of illegal refineries in the Niger Delta. Copyright PUNCH.
