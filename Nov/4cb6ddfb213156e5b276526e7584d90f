Hindi Livinus Governors of the North-East region have expressed support for the domestication of the Violence against Persons Prohibition Act 2015, and all other forms of laws, promising that they would ensure a quick dispensation of justice on gender-based violence. This is just as stakeholders in the region, who demand the domestication of the VAPP Act, 2015, lamented the non-implementation of gender-based violence laws to protect women and the girl child in the North. The stakeholders spoke at a workshop in Yola, Adamawa State, organised by the Global Women for Quality and Sustainable Development, with funding support from European Union-United Nations Spotlight Initiative. The governors, under the North East Governors Forum, chaired by the Borno State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, urged the member states to domesticate the VAPP Act 2015 in their respective states. The communiqué, which the host governor, Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State, read at the end of NEGF meeting, said, “The forum notes that gender-based violence is still a major nuisance in the sub-region and called on all the governors of the zone to domesticate the Violence against Persons Prohibition Act 2015 and ensure the rapid dispensation of justice on gender-based violence.” The GWSD Programme Officer, Milkah Gaman, noted the lack of progress in the domestication of VAPP Act and other laws addressing gender-based violence. She complained that stakeholders had nothing to do with the absence of political will on the part on the governors. Copyright PUNCH.
