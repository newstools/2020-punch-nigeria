Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Magistratesâ€™ Court in Yaba on Tuesday admitted one of the #EndSARS protesters, Eromosele Adene, to bail. The magistrate, O.A. Salawu ruled against the police application seeking to remand Adene for an extra 30 days. The policemen had on November 7 arrested Eromosele in Ikeja. He was last Monday flown to Abuja and brought back to Lagos on Sunday. The police had on Monday approached the court seeking an order to remand him for 30 days despite the fact that he has spent 12 days in their custody. At the resumed proceedings on Tuesday, the prosecutor told the court that the application for the remand order was to investigate Eromosele, adding that the remand of the protester was in the interest of the state. The defence counsel, Tunde Jinadu, urged the court to reject the police application, noting that the application was executive recklessness and legislative rascality. Ruling on the application, Salawu admitted Eromosele to bail in the sum of N1m with two sureties in like sum. He added that one of the sureties must own a property in Lagos. Copyright PUNCH.
