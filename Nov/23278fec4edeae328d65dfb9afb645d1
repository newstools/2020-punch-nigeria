Tunde Oyekola The Kwara State Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, has lifted the four weeks curfew imposed on Ilorin, the state capital. The government said this in a statement on Thursday by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Rafiu Ajakaye. Recall that the state government had imposed the dusk-to-dawn curfew following attacks on government and private businesses which resulted in the looting of goods by hoodlums who hijacked the #EndSARS protests. The statement read partly, “The curfew in Ilorin metropolis is hereby lifted. This is effective from Thursday, November 12. “Citizens are to go about their lawful business without any fear. The government sincerely commends citizens and all critical stakeholders, especially the security agencies, for their support for the measures taken to strengthen security in the wake of some recent developments.”
