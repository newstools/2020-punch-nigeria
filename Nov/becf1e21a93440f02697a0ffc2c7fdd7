Dele Ogunyemi, Warri A popular Delta State cleric, Bishop Godday Okokporo, has asked a former governor of the state, Chief James Ibori, to quit partisan politics to avoid embarrassment. Okokporo, who is the General Overseer of Promise Kingdom Ministry, Sapele, and popularly known as Overflow, gave this advice during a church service on Sunday. The former governor was seated in the congregation during the service. The cleric said, “Your Excellency, Chief James Onanefe Ibori, you have tried your best as a man; you brought development to your people and to the state. But as I speak to you now, the state is tired of you.

If you retire, you have more background, you have more fame, you have more honour than what you see ahead.” Copyright PUNCH.
