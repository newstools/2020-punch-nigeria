Borno State Deputy Governor, Umar Kadafur, has solicited the support of the Nigeria Immigration Service to curb illegal migration and other cross-border crimes in the state. Kadafur made the call on Friday in Maiduguri while receiving the Assistant Controller General in charge of Zone C, Abubakar Kankara, who paid him a courtesy visit. Kadafur said that the Immigration as a critical stakeholder in the security apparatus, has a vital role to play in the implementation of the state’s 25-Year Development Plan. The Deputy Governor assured NIS of government’s sustained support for its operations in the state. Earlier, Kankara said that his team was in Borno on tour of the formations in the zone.
