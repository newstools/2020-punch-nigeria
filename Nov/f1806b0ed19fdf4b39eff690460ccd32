Kayode Oyero Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said he would not be a party to dialogue with his Ebonyi State counterpart, Dave Umahi, to return to the Peoples Democratic Party. According to Wike, Umahi took his decision to leave the PDP and as such, conciliatory efforts won’t yield any result. Controversy continues to trail the defection of Umahi from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress as stakeholders of both parties squabble over the defection of the Ebonyi State governor. Umahi, a longtime member of the PDP, had claimed he defected because of the “injustice” meted to the South-East region by the party, adding that the APC would protect the interest of the region in the 2023 presidential election. But speaking on Wednesday night while featuring on a television programme monitored by The PUNCH, Wike said Umahi left because he wanted to be President and not because the PDP marginalised the South-East as he had claimed. The Rivers State governor said, “As far as PDP is concerned, Umahi has left the party. Yes, we know. But the party has been saying, let’s talk to him. “At a point, I told the Chairman of PDP Governors’ Forum, Hon Aminu Tambuwal. I said I will not be a party to go and talk to Umahi because I do know that what we are going to do will not achieve any results. So, he has left.” [READ ALSO] Lekki shootings: DJ Switch will be exposed soon, says Lai Mohammed Wike added, “All of us are aware that Governor Umahi has been romancing with APC for long. We had a virtual meeting of PDP governors. I have never seen that in my life. Governor Umahi in that meeting, to the surprise of many governors, said ‘there is nothing anybody can do to stop me’. I promised President Buhari I would give him 35 per cent votes’. “I never knew that people never voted in Ebonyi. That votes were allocated and Governor Umahi determined who gets what percentage.”
