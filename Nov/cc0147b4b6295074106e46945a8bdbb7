Ife Ogunfuwa The Nigerian Communications Commission says it was still consulting with stakeholders on the deployment of the fifth generation of mobile network, 5G. The commission, in a statement by the Director of Public Affairs on Tuesday, Dr Ikechukwu Adinde, said it had not concluded plans for the deployment of 5G. The commission explained that it produced a draft consultation document that defined the implementation plan for the deployment of 5G in Nigeria. The telecoms regulator also said it had embarked on discussions with the academia on the new mobile network and was funding 5G related research projects. These collaborations, according to the commission, will ensure that the country is provided with the best in terms of research findings and policy input for the implementation and deployment of 5G technology. It said the document provided guidelines for the relevant areas of the technology and the expectations of the commission from the operators. “For the avoidance of doubt, as with the previous technologies such as 1G, 2G, 3G and 4G, the commission will not commence 5G deployment without due consultation with all relevant stakeholders,” the statement said. The NCC said the engagements were targeted at enabling the development of robust policies, which would put Nigeria in the best place to contribute maximally to the digital economy goals of the nation.
