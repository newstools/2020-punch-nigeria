Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt The All Progressives Congress in Rivers State has faulted the plan by the state government to demolish Ikokwu Market for the construction of the seventh flyover in the state capital, which would traverse Azikiwe Street to Ikokwu Market area in Mile 2 Diobu, Port Harcourt. The opposition party in the state pointed out that such a move would destabilise the traders at the spare parts market. The party in a statement by the spokesman, Ogbonna Nwuke, said appropriate steps were not being taken to relocate the traders. The statement read in part, “In our view, these traders should be given a little time to move to alternative places. We are aware that government has offered a spot at Iriebe to the traders. How ready is the place in terms of security and the provision of other infrastructure required to receive the embattled traders? “We have a lot of regard for all those who are struggling to earn a living. They contribute to our GDP as a nation and take care of the family unit which is the bedrock of any country. “We have no words to spare on the Wike administration at this time. Our eyes are firmly focused on the pain that these displaced traders are going through. We stand with them and share in their grief.”
