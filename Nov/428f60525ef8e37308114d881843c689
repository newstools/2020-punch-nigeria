Barcelona were close to securing an agreement on Friday for a 122 million euros ($145 million) cut in players’ salaries this season to help offset the financial hole left by the coronavirus pandemic. The deal, announced in a statement by the club, must now be ratified by the players “in the coming days”. The reduction in their wage bill represents a welcome financial lifeline for Barca, hit hard by the loss of gate receipts at the Camp Nou and other effects of Covid-19 prevention measures. Barca’s acting president Carles Tusquets has described the financial situation as “not dramatic, but very worrying”.
