Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Ahead of the Bayelsa State West Senatorial bye-election, the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress, on Saturday, inaugurated its campaign committee. The Independent National Electoral Commission has slated December 5th, for outstanding bye-elections nationwide. The APC carried out the inauguration despite the exclusion of the party and its candidate, Peremobowei Ebebi, from the polls. The INEC had on November 19, barred the APC from participating in the poll, citing two judgments of the Federal High Court, Yenagoa, in suits with numbers FHC/YNG/CS/60/2020 and FHC/YNG/CS/66/2020, which restrained the commission from including the party’s name, logo and candidate on the ballot. Speaking during the inauguration of the campaign committee, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and leader of the APC in Bayelsa, Timipre Sylva, alleged that the court rulings were procured. He expressed confidence that the two judgments will be upturned on appeal. Sylva while soliciting votes for the APC and its candidates said, “You all know the antecedents of our candidates, Peremobowei Ebebi and Abel Ebifemowei. You also know that the PDP candidates have failed Bayelsans. “It seems to us the APC family in the state that the judiciary in the state is targeting our party and candidates. “The said judge, who gave the procured judgement, is a PDP judge. She is partisan and we are not surprised at the bias judgement that was delivered in favour of Dickson and his party.” Copyright PUNCH.
