James Abraham, Jos There is fear in Jol community, Riyom Local Government Area of Plateau State, over the alleged existence of poisoned grains reported to be in circulation in the area and other parts of the state. Already, no fewer than 12 residents of the community had been taken to various clinics in the locality. Some of the affected residents were said to have fainted before they were placed on treatment after they allegedly consumed the grains. The Chairman of Riyom LGA, Mr Mafeng Gwallson, confirmed the development in an interview with The PUNCH in Jos on Monday. Gwallson said, “Yes, it is true. When I got the information, I visited the community. “What happened was that the affected residents actually bought the grains (millet) from Makera market in the community. “The grains may have been brought in from Jos or somewhere else. “So, after using it to prepare their local food, a lot of them started vomiting blood. For now, no one has died, but we have no fewer than 12 people that were affected and undergoing treatment.” The chairman said an investigation to unravel the circumstances surrounding the incident had commenced. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Nimkong Lar, warned residents against eating grains looted at various government warehouses during the recent #EndSARS protests in the state, stressing that some of them which were meant for planting contained some chemicals and not fit for human consumption.
