Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti An Ekiti State High Court sitting in Ado Ekiti on Wednesday sentenced another two men to death by hanging for armed robbery. The convicts, Lanre Kayode (34) and Olanrewaju Aremu (35), who were armed with guns and cutlasses, robbed one Oluremi Jimoh of her laptops, phones and a Toyota Camry car in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital. They were arraigned on conspiracy, armed robbery and burglary. The verdict came less than a week after another Ekiti State High Court sentenced two men to death for a similar offence. Justice Lucas Ogundana, in his judgment on Wednesday said, “The law has prescribed mandatory punishment for the offence committed by the accused persons and the court cannot pass a less sentence having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case. “Accordingly, the two accused persons are hereby sentenced to death by hanging until they breathe their last.” On the charges of conspiracy and burglary, he sentenced the two convicts to life imprisonment. According to the charge sheet, the two defendants, on or about July 14, 2017, around 2am at Oke Ila area of Ado Ekiti, were armed with guns and cutlasses to rob one Jimoh Folajoke Oluremi of her laptops, phones and a Toyota Camry car. In her testimony before the court, the victim said the defendants were arrested after her phones were tracked by the police, leading to the recovery of all other items taken from her. The Ekiti State Attorney General, Olawale Fapohunda, who prosecuted the case, called four witnesses, just as the confessional statements of the defendants were tendered as exhibits. Copyright PUNCH.
