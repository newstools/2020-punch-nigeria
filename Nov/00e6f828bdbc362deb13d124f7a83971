Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Ajibola Basiru, has said no member of the National Assembly was hoarding palliatives meant for distribution to Nigerians in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Director, Media and Publicity of the Muhammadu Buhari 2019 Presidential Campaign Committee, Kailani Muhammad, had  alleged that the lawmakers and some governors were hoarding palliatives. Basiru in a statement on Monday described the allegations as either wicked lies or deliberate  misinformation on the part of  Kailani. He said, “While not speaking for the governors, I make bold to say that no federal lawmaker and indeed, no Senator received any kobo from Mr President or any food stuff or any material for that matter, talk less of hoarding them. “Rather at the Senate, we donated half of members’ salaries for the purpose of cushioning the effect of COVID 19. “We legislators equally played our part by purchasing and distributing palliatives to people at our different constituencies. “So it is quite unfortunate for Kilani Mohammed or anyone to castigate us in the public and saying what is not true,” he said. Basiru however cautioned against “deliberate falsehood to paint Federal Lawmakers in bad light for whatever motive.” Copyright PUNCH.
