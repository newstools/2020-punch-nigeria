Dayo Ojerinde As part of efforts to reduce the spread of coronavirus in the country, ExxonMobil Foundation, Africare and the National Basketball Association have advised Nigerians on the need to practice regular hand washing habits and the use of sanitiser. In a statement on Monday, organisations said they have donated 30,000 masks, 90 new hand washing stations and hand sanitizers to 30 schools in Abuja. The President, ExxonMobil Foundation, Mr Kevin Murphy, said the Foundation in collaboration with other partners was organising an event, tagged, ‘Power Forward Huddle,’ to educate young people on how to protect themselves from infectious diseases. He said the event was scheduled to hold on November 19 virtually. “Using the convening power of sports, our successful collaboration with the NBA and Africare allows young people to play the games they love while receiving the life-skills and public health messages they need to stay healthy. Nigerians are advised to continue to obey the COVID-19 guidelines; the virus has not been defeated yet. People must continue to use their face masks, wash their hands regularly and use sanitiser.” Murphy said. Copyright PUNCH.
