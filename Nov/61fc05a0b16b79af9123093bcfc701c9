Sodiq Oyeleke The Peoples Democratic Party has expressed confidence that its candidates would emerge victorious in the upcoming bye-elections in Lagos State on Saturday. This was contained in a press statement titled, ‘We have won because of our candidates – Lagos PDP claims from polls’, by the Lagos PDP’s spokesperson, Taofik Gani. The PDP’s candidates in the election are Mr Babatunde Gbadamosi for Lagos-East senatorial election and Mr Shikiru Alebiosu for Kosofe Constituency II House of Assembly. Mr Tokunbo Abiru and Obafemi Saheed are candidates of APC in Lagos East Senatorial and Kosofe Constituency II House of Assembly bye-elections respectively. He said polls have shown that “the APC candidates will come distant runners-up in four of the five Local Government Areas, and clearly lose in Kosofe Constituency 2.” Gani said the party would use legal and political means to resist the manipulation of the election results from the polling units to final collation centres. The poll organisations were said to have used such criteria as to eligibility; voter’s trust; ability to deliver representation; internal party democracy; loyalty to electorates; age; individualism; and 2023 projection among others. He said, “The PDP has therefore asserted that only manifestly fair and true results will be accepted by her agents and therefore admonish all agencies that will be charged with the conduct of the elections to be fair and just. “We are already celebrating our projected victories and we hope to celebrate the actual results when announced. By polls now reported, our candidates have 65 per cent to 30 per cent lead scores. “To our surprise, we are informed that the manner of emergence of the APC candidates will be reasons to lose. What we expect is free, fair and credible bye-elections. We shall resist any rigging. We will not sleep over our mandate this time.”
