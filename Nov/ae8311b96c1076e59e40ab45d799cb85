Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal government has approved a joint council memo of the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development with the Federal Ministry of Interior to end statelessness in Nigeria. It was learnt that the approval was given at the Federal Executive Council meeting held at the State House on November 25, 2020, which was presided over by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). In a jointly processed presentation by the two ministries, the humanitarian affairs minister, Sadiya Farouq, aligned with the submission made by the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, according to a statement issued by Farouq’s media aide, Nneka Anibeze, in Abuja. Farouq said the approval of the National Action Plan would demonstrate Nigeria’s strong commitment to implementing the Abidjan Declaration of ECOWAS member states on the eradication of statelessness. She also stated that the COVID-19 pandemic had worsened the plight of millions of stateless persons worldwide and called on the President to include and protect stateless populations by approving the National Action Plan. The minister was quoted as saying, “The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the critical need for greater inclusion and urgent resolution of situations which place individuals at risk of exclusion including statelessness.” Copyright PUNCH.
