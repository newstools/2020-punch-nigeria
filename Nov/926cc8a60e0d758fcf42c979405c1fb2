Sunday Aborisade, Abuja Chairman of the Investment and Securities Tribunal, Amos Azi, said on Wednesday that the court had saved investors over N800bn since its establishment in 2007. He said the IST was determined to encourage investors in the capital market through adjudication and determination of cases. The development came just as the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Lamido Yuguda, said the capital market would soon be strengthened with a finance technology. Azi and Yuguda spoke on Wednesday when they appeared before the Senate committee on Capital Market to defend their 2021 budget proposal. Azi said, “From inception till date, we make bold to say that the IST has adjudicated and determined cases of monetary value of over N800billion in favour of various investors which we believe is very encouraging to investors. “The investors now know that they have where to approach in case of a dispute.” He said that the IST had established four zonal offices in the country in order to bring adjudication closer to investors at their door steps instead of traveling to Abuja.
