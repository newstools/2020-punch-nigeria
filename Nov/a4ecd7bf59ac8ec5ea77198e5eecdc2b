Oladimeji Ramon A Lagos-based technology firm, Chams Plc, says it has developed a reliable electronic voting platform, VOTA, which enables people to cast their votes in an election anywhere at their convenience. The Executive Director, Chams Plc, Mrs Mayowa Olaniyan, said in a statement on Monday that VOTA was designed primarily for elections of professional bodies, corporate groups and associations. Olaniyan said the platform “enables individuals to vote from the convenience of their smart devices whilst fully maintaining the integrity of the voting process.” “VOTA guarantees the privacy of the voter, the vote and the legitimacy of the results, while reducing the costs involved in holding an election,” Olaniyan added.
