Joseph Olaoluwa The Council of Maritime Transport Unions and Associations has asked the Federal Government to intervene and regulate charges of barge operators in Lagos. President of COMTUA, Leye Thompson, who spoke with our correspondent said the charges on the movement of consignments along the waterways was too high. He stressed that barge operators should serve as a relief and make business easier. He said, “The barge business is a good idea. At least, it will help decongest the roads as well but their charges are what my members are complaining about. “The charges are abnormal and on the high side. If you are to come in as a relief, there is no reason you should be asking for N200,000 – N250,000 for a container.” He added, “If they can review their price and it is reasonable then that will be a noble idea.” The COMTUA boss said the group planned to engage the Nigerian Shippers’ Council and the Nigerian Ports Authority on the need to review and regulate pricing of barges.
