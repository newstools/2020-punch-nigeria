Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The police in Rivers State have confirmed the abduction and murder of a former Rivers State chairman of the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, Ebenezer Amah. Amah was reportedly kidnapped by gunmen who trailed him to his residence on Precious Chukwu Street in Woji, Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the state while he was driving into his house on Wednesday night.

His body was evacuated and taken to the hospital mortuary for preservation. “The vehicle is in our custody. Investigation has commenced into the incident to ensure that the suspects behind the dastardly act are apprehended and all hands are on deck.” Deputy National Chairman of the Trade Union Congress, Chika Onuegbu, while commenting, said, “ETK Amah was a very good comrade who radiated joy everywhere he went.
