Nike Popoola The National Pension Commission has given the Pension Fund Administrators directives on how to ensure smooth movement of Retirement Savings Accounts and Retiree Life Annuity as it opens the transfer window. It disclosed this in a directive on Friday entitled, “Circular on fund accounting,” ahead of its plan to open the transfer window on Monday (today). The transfer window would enable contributors to change their PFAs at most, ones in a year. PenCom stated, “This fund accounting circular is for reporting the accounting entries for the transfer of RSA from one PFA to another and the purchase of RLA by retirees with their RSA balances. “The provisions of this circular are consistent with the PRA, 2014.” The main objectives of the circular was to ensure that accurate and reliable records were maintained and there was uniformity in record-keeping across the pension industry, it said. In line with the regulation for the transfer of RSA, PenCom said the following ledger and bank accounts must be maintained by PFAs for each of the RSA Funds. It said the accounts were RSA fund investment transit account, RSA transfer allocation account, consolidated investment transit account, and consolidated transfer transit account. PenCom had earlier said it had concluded arrangements for the take-off of RSA transfers. It said it successfully developed the RSA transfer application, a robust electronic platform that would enable seamless RSA transfers. Copyright PUNCH.
