Kayode Oyero The West African Examinations Council has relocated its office in Calabar, the Cross River State capital to its zonal office in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital. WAEC Nigeria said the relocation is “till further notice,” adding that the movement became necessary following “vandalisation, looting and burning down of the WAEC Branch Office, Calabar by hoodlums on Saturday, October 24, 2020.” This was contained in a statement on Tuesday titled, ‘Temporary Relocation Of Waec Branch Office Calabar, Cross River State, To Waec Zonal Office, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State’. The statement was signed by the Council’s Acting Head of Public Affairs, Demianus Ojijeogu. It partly read, “The relocation, which is an interim measure, is to enable the Council to continue to carry out its operations and render services to the Nigerian Child and other stakeholders. We wish to assure all stakeholders and the general public that normal operations would resume in the Calabar Branch Office once the status quo ante is restored. “The Council wishes to apologise to its stakeholders and the general public for any inconvenience that may arise as a result of this relocation. “We wish to use this medium to thank all those who have, in one way or the other, sympathised or identified with us during this trying period.” Rampaging hoodlums had hijacked the #EndSARS protests against police brutality to wreak havoc on Nigerians. Many public and private facilities were torched in the unrest. Meanwhile, WAEC has released the results of candidates who sat for the 2020 West African Senior School Certificate Examination in Nigeria. It, however, withheld the results of 215,149 candidates for various reported cases of examination malpractice.
