Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, has said the Federal Government keeps spending on airports across the country despite planned concession in order to have more bargaining power in negotiating with private investors. Sirika told the House of Representatives that the government would continue to invest more in infrastructure in the aviation sector while executing its  concession plan. The minister said this in Abuja on Thursday when he appeared before the House Committee on Aviation, in reaction to questions from lawmakers on expenses. Sirika had appeared before the committee to defend the ministry’s 2021 budget proposal. He said, “I think there are a lot of misconceptions about this concession. In the first instance, you can actually build a structure to international standard; very operational, make it very beautiful and then, of course, concession it so that it is run better.” Copyright PUNCH.
