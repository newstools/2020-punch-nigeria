Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki Members of the sacked State Executive Committee of the Ebonyi State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, have rejected their removal from office. They declared that the National Working Committee of the PDP lacked the powers to dissolve the party’s executive committees at all levels. National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, had in a statement early on Wednesday announced the dissolution of the executive committees. The decision, he said, was taken after the NWC reviewed happenings within the state chapter of the party. However, the chairman of the dissolved SEC, Onyekachi Nwebonyi, told newsmen during a press conference at the party’s Secretariat in Abakaliki, on Wednesday, that the national body’s action was an enterprise in futility. He said, “My attention has been drawn to a press release by the national publicity secretary of the PDP that the NWC of the PDP has dissolved the Ward, Local Government, and the State Executive Committees of the party in Ebonyi State, because of Governor David Umahi’s planned defection to the All Progressives Congress, APC. “It is laughable to think that the NWC would just get up and dissolve a state executive committee because the governor or a few individuals want to leave the party. “We are in charge of the party in Ebonyi State for the next four years having been duly elected for a four-year term recently. Our tenure will elapse in 2024 and nobody has the power to dissolve the state executives.” He also threatened to challenge the NWC’s decision in court. Copyright PUNCH.
