Joseph Olaoluwa The Nigerian Ports Authority, Tin Can Island Port Complex, has assured stakeholders of better traffic situation along the port access roads. It said it had concluded plans to suspend stripping operations within the access road, as part of efforts to encourage free flow of movement of cargoes in and out of the port. The Traffic Manager, TCIPC, NPA, Mr Peter Abiri, in a statement, explained that enforcement of the exercise would commence midnight Wednesday, November 25, adding that container stripping activities in some of the facilities would be  temporarily suspended. He stated, “Please be informed that starting midnight Wednesday 25th November, 2020, all container stripping activities in your terminal/yard is temporarily suspended.” The Traffic Manager noted that resumption of stripping activities will be reconsidered after the port access road has been cleared of all impediments. He pointed out that any violation of the directive by the operators would result in the closure of the terminals. As part of efforts to rid the ports of congestion, the traffic manager said that the e-call up system would commence operations before the end of the year. According to him, five stripping facilities within the port complex had been notified to suspend such operations, noting that the activities of the operations could be attributed to the gridlock within the access road. This was coming just after freight forwarders berated the Nigerian Ports Authority and Nigerian Shippers’ Council for providing inadequate attention to port activities at Tin Can Island Port.
