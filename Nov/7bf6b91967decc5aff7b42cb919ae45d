The police boss said the circumstances that led to the death of the APC chairman indicated that it was not all about kidnapping, but that the yet-to-be-identified attackers may have been assassins. He said, “From what we have seen since yesterday and the intensity of  bullet marks on the wall of the house and the forceful gaining of entrance into the house proved that it was much more than kidnapping.” “And where we found his body, close to his house, normally when kidnapping is carried out it is for profit-making, but this has shown that within a twinkling of an eye the man was killed, no demand was made whatsoever,” Longe added. He continued,  “So, I believed it was an assassination, but that notwithstanding, we are going to carry out an exhaustive investigation that will give us a clue to what actually happened, for now, I believed it was an assassination.”
