The Transparency group commended NNPC’s Group Managing Director, Mele Kyari, for deepening transparency and accountability in the corporation. The statement quoted EITI’s Executive Director, Mark Robinson, as saying, “The NNPC has set a good example and could lead in championing transparency for other NOCs (National Oil Companies) in Africa.” The global body invited Kyari to speak at its virtual workshop holding next month on the topic ‘Learning from mainstreaming disclosure efforts’. The workshop will explore opportunities for making the systematic disclosure of extractive data the norm.
