Dayo Ojerinde Alumni of the Advance Management Programme 26 of the Lagos Business School have donated face masks to Community High School, Lekki. The Chairman of the Corporate Social Responsibility of the group, Mr Dimeji Olona, said the donation was their way of giving back to society and curbing the spread of coronavirus. He said, “The donation of 320 packs of medical face masks is our way of giving back to society. The idea is that each of the pupils and members of staff will be given two of the face masks per week. “We went to the Lagos Business School for Advance Management Programme 26 in 2014. After we finished our programme, one of the things that LBS taught us is to give back to society. From 2015, we decided to contribute our quota to the development of the education and health sector of the country. “We also decided that if we want our contribution to be meaningful, we should choose a school. So, we went in search of a school and later settled for this school, Lekki Community High School.” He added that the group also donated chairs, tables and facilitated the provision of computers for the school. The Principal, Community Senior High School, Lekki, Mr Olusegun Ajayi, urged members of the public to support the government’s efforts in the education sector. “For us in rural areas, most of the parents of our pupils cannot even afford textbooks and other basic things their children will need in school. But with the help of an organisation like AMP 26 of LBS, the pupils will enjoy coming to school,” Ajayi said. Copyright PUNCH.
