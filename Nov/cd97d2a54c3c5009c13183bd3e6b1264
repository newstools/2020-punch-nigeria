All Progressives Congress’ youths have canvassed votes for the party’s candidate in the Lagos-East senatorial bye-election, Rotimi Abiru. The Youth Organising Secretary of Lagos APC, Idris Aregbe, said the APC candidate would give back to Lagos, especially the constituency that made him, Lagos-East senatorial district. The APC youth organising secretary had been contributing to the development of the state while in the private sector. Aregbe, in a statement, said Abiru was seeking office to ensure quality representation for Lagosians at the National Assembly. He added that the APC candidate would sustain the late senator Sikiru Osinowo’s efforts in attracting the Federal Government’s attention to the plights of Lagos residents. He said, “I implore all youths in Epe, Ikorodu, Kosofe, Somolu, Ibeju-Lekki, and its environs and indeed all lovers of the youths to come out en-masse on December 5, 2020, to vote Tokunbo Abiru for the Lagos East Senatorial seat. “Reading his manifestoes showed that he is passionate about people’s plight and that was why he decided to set up an endowment fund that will largely accommodate persons with special needs within the district and promote legislations and policies that will institutionalise the empowerment of every person with special needs in the country.
