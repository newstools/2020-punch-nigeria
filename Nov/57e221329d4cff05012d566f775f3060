Joseph Olaoluwa About 1,000 ex-workers of the Nigerian Aviation Handling Company Plc have issued a two-week ultimatum to the Bureau of Public Enterprises over the continued delay in addressing issues affecting the payment of their N1.3bn severance package. Speaking at a press conference in Lagos on Friday, human rights activist and counsel to the ex-workers, Mr Joe Nwokedi, said many of the ex-workers had died of health-related challenges in recent months even as BPE continue to delay the payment of their life-time entitlements. Nwokedi, who is the Principal Partner, Interveners and Joe Nwokedi Solicitors, said the firm was forced to take over the case of the Ex-NAHCO Workers Forum against the BPE as he could not imagine how Nigerians who had laboured to serve their organisation for many years could be made to face delays in getting their hard-earned entitlements. According to Nwokedi, the forum will be proceeding to court to press the case, if the BPE fails to respond to a letter demanding details of payments to be made to the EX-NAHCO workers numbering about 1,000. The human rights activist noted that since October 7, 2020 when his firm wrote the BPE on behalf of the ex-workers demanding details of the payment and how it would be paid, the agency had yet responded. The continued delay, according to him, showed the BPE had many things to hide regarding the N1.3bn severance package. ‚ÄùCopyright PUNCH.
