Kayode Oyero Democratic challenger Joe Biden, says it is not his place or incumbent President Donald Trump’s place to declare the winner of Tuesday election. Biden, who spoke live from Wilmington, Delaware on Tuesday night, said it is the place of the American people to declare their next president through the ballots. He said, “We know this is gonna go long but who knows if it is gonna go longer. But we feel good about where we are. We believe we are on track to win this election. “We know because beyond president’s early votes, the mailing votes is going to take a while. We gonna have to be patient until the hard work of counting votes is finished, until every vote is counted. But we’re feeling good about where we are. “It’s not my place or Donald Trump’s place to declare the winner of this election. That’s the decision of the American people. But I am optimistic about this outcome.” Already, polls have closed across the United States and a long night of waiting for results lies ahead. As of the time of filing this report, US media claimed Trump won 23 states with 213 electoral votes while Biden won 20 states with 238 electoral votes. The magic number of electoral votes is 270 and no winner has emerged so far as there are seven states yet to be called. A record number of ballots were cast before Election Day, totalling more than 100 million, due to fears of congregating in polling stations in person during the coronavirus pandemic.
