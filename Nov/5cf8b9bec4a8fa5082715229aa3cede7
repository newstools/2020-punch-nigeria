Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan The Commissioner of Police in Oyo State, Mr Chuks Enwonwu, has said the police will not fold their arms and watch criminals shed the blood of innocent persons in the name of any protest in the state. The CP called on traditional rulers as well as other stakeholders, including parents and guardians, to appeal to their children and subjects not to embark on any act that could lead to a breakdown of law and order in the state. Enwonwu, who said this on Sunday in a statement by the Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Olugbenga Fadeyi, lamented the loss of lives recorded during the violence that trailed the last #EndSARS protest in the state. He said apart from the human lives lost, there was a massive destruction of properties and stealing of police arms and ammunition. “The command is battle-ready to deal decisively with persons or groups who are bent on disturbing the relative peace being enjoyed by the good people of Oyo State. Likewise, maximum securities to lives and property of Oyo State citizens are guaranteed as adequate security measure have been emplaced during this period and beyond. “There is synergy and collaboration among the sisters security agencies in the state and therefore criminal elements should not attempt to test the collective will as any individual or groups who does so shall have his/herself to blame,” the statement quoted the CP to have said.
