Alexander Okere Former Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, has called on leaders across the North-Central geo-political zone to work for the development, peace and unity of the region. Saraki stated this when the executives and a cross-section of members of the North-Central Peoples’ Forum paid him a courtesy visit at his home in Maitama, Abuja, according to a statement by the Abubakar Bukola Saraki Media Office. The former Kwara State governor stressed that the development of the zone was in the interest of the entire nation. While promising to render his support, Saraki said collective efforts aimed at developing the North-Central were long overdue. The statement titled, ‘Saraki calls for sustainable development of North-Central zone,’ read in part, “If you talk about the unity of this country, you must factor in the North-Central. If you are talking about the future of this country, it lies on many of the resources, like minerals and agriculture, which our region has. “This is why forums like this are crucial because it will give us a credible platform to push for the holistic development of our region. My father of blessed memory and other leaders, like Chief Sunday Awoniyi, have all tried very hard to support the mobilisation of the people for the development of the North Central region.
