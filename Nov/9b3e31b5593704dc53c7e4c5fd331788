Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The implementation of the revised service reflective tariff for electricity by power distribution companies is creating confusion among power consumers as some customers of Discos described it as an illegality. According to the Nigerian Electricity Consumers Advocacy Network, a body of power sector experts and consumers from various sectors, the non-release of an order on the revised tariff by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission had made matters worse. The Chairman of NERC, Prof. James Momoh, had told our correspondent on Friday that the commission was working to post an order on the revised tariff on its website, but this had yet to happen as of the time of filing this report on Monday.

He added, “The order will specify the various reductions in percentages and the respective bands of customers that were affected. “The commission had earlier said it suspended the service reflective tariff because of the negotiations between organised labour and the Federal Government and that negotiation had many discordant tunes.” The PUNCH reported on Monday that power distribution companies commenced the implementation of the revised electricity tariff that was jointly agreed upon by organised labour and the Federal Government.
