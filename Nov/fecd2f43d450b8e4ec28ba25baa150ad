A former militia leader in the Democratic Republic of Congo was sentenced on Monday to life in prison for war crimes and mass rape, in a decision hailed by the United Nations. Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka was convicted of “murder, rape, sexual slavery, enlisting children under 15 years old,” a decade ago, a military court ruled. The UN representative in DR Congo, Leila Zerrougui, said the ruling showed “impunity is not inevitable”. (AFP)
