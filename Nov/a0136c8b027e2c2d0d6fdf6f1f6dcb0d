Sampson Itode, THE King of Oyigbo town in Oyigbo LGA of Rivers State, Eze Mike Nwaji, has pleaded with the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, and the military hierarchy in the state to caution soldiers against the indiscriminate arrests of residents in the area. The monarch decried the trend of residents unleashing soldiers on their neighbours in a bid to undo them, even as he called on the soldiers in the area to be more professional in the discharge of their duties. Nwaji said, “Even if the person is a member of IPOB, I overheard the governor said that the activities of IPOB in Rivers State has been proscribed. I didn’t hear the governor say search them from house to house, but the governor said their activities, meetings, gatherings. “So, any person going round and telling soldiers to come and see IPOB (should stop); the main people who committed the offence had all run away.” When contacted, the Spokesman of the 6 Division, Nigerian Army in Port Harcourt, Major Charles Ekeocha, insisted that the army in the state had been professional in the discharge of their duties.
