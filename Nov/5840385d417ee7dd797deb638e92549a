John Alechenu, Abuja THE Peoples Democratic Party has said the military operation by United State troops, which led to the rescue of an American citizen, who was captured in Niger Republic and was being held on Nigerian soil, was further proof of the incompetence of Nigeria’s President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, said this in a statement titled, ‘US rescue operation again confirms Buhari’s incompetence, says PDP’, in Abuja on Sunday. The statement read in part, “It is indeed grossly disconcerting that under our Commander-in-Chief, a general, who had consistently promised to lead from the front, it took a foreign country to come on our soil to rescue their citizen, while hordes of our citizens are reportedly being held, tortured and killed in various kidnappers and insurgents’ dens in various parts of our nation.” READ ALSO: Two dead as vehicles collide in Lagos It also recalled that not too long ago, the Chadian President, Idriss Derby, led his troops into Nigerian territory to secure victory over Boko Haram. In response, the APC in a statement titled, ‘The world remembers PDP government’s negligence in Chibok schoolgirls’ abduction – APC’, signed by the Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, said, “The PDP again chooses to play politics with our national security in its tired, baseless and dull attacks of the President Muhammadu Buhari government. “To refresh the PDP’s memory, former British prime minister, David Cameron in his book, ‘For the Record’, said the Goodluck Jonathan PDP government was sleeping on the wheel when the schoolgirls were abducted.” Copyright PUNCH.
