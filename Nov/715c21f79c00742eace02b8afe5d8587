Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Friday inaugurated the National Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, who inaugurated the centre in Abuja, said the inauguration was in line with the digital skills acquisition drive of government as captured in the National Economic Development Policy and Strategy. He said the centre was the first of its kind in Nigeria and was implemented by the National Information Technology Development Agency based on its mandate. He said, “The global paradigm shift from mere paper qualifications to proven skills, particularly digital skills, has necessitated the establishment of a high tech skill acquisition centre such as this. “The centre will serve as a leading hub of innovation, research and development, knowledge transfer and training in the areas of artificial intelligence, robotics and other emerging technologies. “In addition, the centre will create a vision for AI, develop an AI ecosystem, support data stewardship, while providing access to specialised technical skills in the country.” The Director-General, NITDA, Kashifu Inuwa, urged Nigerian youths to take advantage of the initiatives and strategies deployed by government to empower themselves. He said the centre was fully equipped with training facilities, 3D printers, co-working space for start-ups, a digital innovation laboratory, maker-space and fabrication laboratory infrastructure. Other facilities in the centre include printed circuit boards, as Inuwa stated that the centre was housing the offices of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Programme. He said the centre also housed the Office for ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship, NITDA’s subsidiary arm for Innovation.
