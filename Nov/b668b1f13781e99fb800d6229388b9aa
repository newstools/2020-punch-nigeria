John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd.), to take lessons from the post-election remarks of the President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden, by addressing the divisiveness, nepotism and marginalisation which have become the hallmarks of his regime. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘US Election: PDP Congratulates Joe Biden, Americans…Says US Election is a Lesson To Leaders,’ signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, on Sunday. The party congratulated the US President-elect, Joe Biden, on his successful election as the 46th President of the United States. The statement reads partly, “The election is a lesson to leaders that power resides with the people and that there is a limit to how any individual can hold a people to ransom. “The PDP charges President Muhammadu Buhari to draw lessons from the post-election remarks of the US President-elect by addressing the divisive tendencies, nepotism and marginalization which characterize his administration as well as other actions and policies that threaten the stability, unity and development of our nation. “However, in congratulating the US President-elect, the PDP urges him to use his new office to promote world unity, peace, global economic, political and international trade collaborations with focus on Africa as well as the developing world.
