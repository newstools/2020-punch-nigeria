Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan The Oyo State College of Education, Lanlate, has been shut down indefinitely as the crisis between the Students Union of the institution and the management led by the Provost, Dr Jospeh Adeagbo, got messier on Tuesday. The Students Union’s President, Olaitan Muhammad, in an interview with our correspondent on the telephone confirmed that the college had been shut down by the Governing Council. The students had embarked on protests over the alleged failure of the college to produce identity cards for students despite collecting money from them. They claimed that some dangerous animals had been attacking them during lectures because of the bushes surrounding the place. But the management of the school in a statement by the Public Relations Officer of the college, Adeniyi Jolaoso, said academic and social activities were going on well at the college before the students suddenly embarked on a protest on November 5. The management claimed in the statement that staff unions sponsored the students to cause crises. The management also debunked all allegations against it, the provost, and the DSA. The statement read, “The college management wishes to assure that it charges one of the lowest school fees in the country, in consonance with the directive of the Governor Seyi Makinde-led administration and payment of all fees is made into the Treasury Single Account (TSA) of the Oyo State Government. “So, there are no outrageous fees charged by the college. Any demand for any payment other than that into the Treasury Single Account should be reported immediately. “Students are also encouraged to pick up their ID cards that have been lying down ready for collection at the Student Affairs office while those who are yet to undertake their photo capture for the student ID card should approach the schedule officer at the ICT and collect their ID card not later than one week after the capture.”
