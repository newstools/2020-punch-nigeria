Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja Singer, Abolore Akande aka 9ice, has apologised to Nigerians and his wife, Olasukanmi, for cheating on her. The musician made the plea on Saturday days after a viral video posted by Gistlover Blog showed him kissing another woman. In the video, 9ice hugs the unidentified woman in a compromising manner and kisses her on the cheek while he jokingly calls her his wife. However, in a video on Saturday, the Gongo Aso crooner said he had made a terrible mistake and pleaded with Nigerians to help him beg his wife whom he married less than a year ago. He said, “I have done something so shameful, terrible and it is costing me my family and the most important thing to me right now is my family. That 9ice that you always see and appreciate is because I have a backbone which is my wife, Olasukanmi Akande. And because of this terrible thing I have done, it is costing me a whole lot “I apologise for what I have done and I need you guys to help me beg my wife. She is my backbone. That 9ice you always see, that strives, that brings out the best in our culture and tradition is because I have a backbone. I apologise for my wrongdoing and I need you guys to help me beg my wife. “One thing that has been failing is my marriage but I want this one to work. Please, please help me beg my wife. Save this marriage for me.” The musician was first married to Antoinette Payne aka Tony Payne, and later Adetola Anifalaje which he divorced.
