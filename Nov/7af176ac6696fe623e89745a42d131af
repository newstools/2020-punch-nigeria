Tunde Ajaja The Chartered Institute of Professional Printers of Nigeria has asked the Bureau of Public Procurement to make public the names of the group of eight printers that will execute the N2.9bn contract for the printing of sensitive and non-sensitive examination materials as approved by the Federal Executive Council. The FEC meeting, presided over by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on October 28 said the materials would serve the Basic Education Certification Examination, the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination and the National Common Entrance. In a statement on Friday, CIPPON President, Mr Olugbemi Malomo, commended the Federal Government for awarding the contract to Nigerian printers, saying the timing was good given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sector and how the sector lost N1tn whenever government awarded such jobs to foreign companies. He added, “In the bid to ensure that the aforementioned demands are met, the institute has sent a letter to the BPP to make public the names of the group of eight printers executing the contracts. This is for the institute to ascertain that the contract will be executed in Nigeria and to ensure the printers are registered practitioners as stipulated in section 23 (b) of Printers Act 24 of 2007.” Copyright PUNCH.
