Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federation Account Allocation Committee disbursed a total of N2.05tn to the three tiers of government and other statutory recipients in the third quarter of the year, figures released on Tuesday by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiatives showed. According to NEITI, this was despite the COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant socioeconomic consequences. A breakdown of the figures showed that the Federal Government received N812.22bn; state governments, N676.5bn; while Local Government Areas got N429.16bn. “This was the first time that total disbursement has exceeded N2tn for a quarter in 2020,” NEITI stated in its latest Quarterly Review. The review analysed FAAC disbursements in the third quarter of 2020, using data from the National Bureau of Statistics and the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission. “Total disbursements of N2.05tn in 2020 Q3 were 6.2 per cent higher than total disbursements of N1.93tn in 2020 Q2, and 5.6 per cent higher than total disbursements of N1.95tn in 2020 Q1,” the report stated.
