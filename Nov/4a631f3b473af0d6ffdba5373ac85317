John Alechenu, Abuja THE Peoples Democratic Party has accused the All Progressives Congress of frustrating genuine efforts aimed at restructuring Nigeria. The party said this in a statement titled, ‘APC is frustrating genuine restructuring – PDP, insists on 2014 National Conference report’, signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja on Tuesday. It alleged that the APC was trying to manipulate the system and frustrate the widespread clamour and efforts by the majority of Nigerians for genuine restructuring. The opposition party described plans by the APC to smuggle the partisan report of its committee on restructuring into the National Assembly to replace the 2014 National Conference Report, “as an unpardonable assault on the sensibility of over 200 million Nigerians, whose collective interests are contained in the Conference report.” Ologbondiyan said, “Nigerians are also alerted of a fresh ploy by some ambitious APC leaders to blackmail the legislature and create an impression of commitment to restructuring, just to beguile the people and soften the ground for their personal political and particularly, presidential ambitions ahead of the 2023 elections. “Our party stands at the forefront of efforts for genuine restructuring, but we hold that the authentic materials for a genuine restructuring are contained in the 2014 National Conference report.” Spokesman for the APC, Yekini Nabena, in response, said, “We’ve made our position on this issue known.” Copyright PUNCH.
