Sodiq Oyeleke The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), says he is proud of Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, for defecting to the All Progressives Congress. The president commended the defection of Umahi to APC, describing it “as a bold move driven purely by principle rather than opportunistic motives.” This was contained in a press statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President, Garba Shehu, on Wednesday. The statement was titled, ‘President Buhari praises Umahi’s defection, says it’s based on principle rather than coercion’. It quoted Buhari as saying, “I am proud of Governor David Umahi for taking this bold decision in accordance with his conscience and principles rather than any external influence or coercion. “Good governance is very important to us in the APC, and I’m glad that the governor has cited this as a major factor in his decision to join us. I urge our citizens to pay less emphasis on identity politics if we want our democracy to make a positive impact on our country.” He noted that “with men like Umahi, I foresee a brighter future for our democracy because the voters will be more motivated by performance records of parties and their candidates.” “Let me once again; commend the boldness of Governor Umahi for taking this courageous decision in a country where principles are in short supply among many. I know people might call him names, but that is the price men of principles have to pay for acting according to their conscience and convictions,” Buhari added.
