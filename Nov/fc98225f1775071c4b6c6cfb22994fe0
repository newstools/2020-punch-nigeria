Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri Seven Imo State lawmakers elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, staged a boycott of plenary in the State Assembly on Wednesday and Thursday over discrepancies in the payment of their salaries and allowances. Our correspondent gathered that the allowances due to the minority, deputy minority leaders, and minority whip, were withheld by the state government. The seven PDP lawmakers are: Okey Onyekanma, Anyadike Nwosu, Frank Ugboma, Philip Ejiogu, Paschal Okorie, Tochi Okoro and Solomon Anukam, who accused the state government of playing dangerous politics. Our correspondent also learnt that the money in question was allegedly shared by the lawmakers of the All Progressives Congress. The opposition lawmakers in a statement, in Owerri, on Thursday, said the state government was clamping down on the opposition in the state. They described the action as unlawful insisting that no antic can stop from speaking truth to power. They demanded that their entitlements be paid in full. When contacted, the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Dominic Ezerioha, denied the allegations. He said he was not aware that any such thing happened. Copyright PUNCH.
