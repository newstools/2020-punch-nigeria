Ted Odogwu, Kano The Nigeria Police Academy, Wudil, Kano, on Tuesday, proposed the introduction of more core policing courses into its curriculum to address the human rights abuse by policemen. The commandant of the academy, AIG Ibrahim Zanna, who made the disclosure during the matriculation of the seventh regular course cadets, said the recent #EndSARS protests had posed serious challenges that required scientific research that would advance policing through recruitment, training and capacity development of officers that would provide and promote partnership with communities for optimal service delivery. He said, “If you listen to my speech, I actually advocated for core policing courses that have to do with human rights and professionalism, so that by the time these cadets go to the field, they certainly will have respect for human rights, they will not go about doing unwholesome acts, just like the allegations being made by members of the public against the SARS.” “So, I want to assure you that the graduates that will be churned out of Nigeria Police Academy will be highly professional because from time to time we are reviewing our curriculum to go along with changing realities to go along with changing time.” Copyright PUNCH.
