Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki bonyi State Governor, David Umahi, on Thursday, sacked the Coordinators of Ivo and Echiele Development Centres, Okorie Daniel and Fabian Ovoke, respectively. This is coming on the heels of the governor’s dissolution of boards and commissions of state agencies, whose appointments were not tenured. Recall that Umahi, on Tuesday, dissolved the boards of Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki, and Ebonyi State College of Education, Ikwo. The Secretary to the State Government, Dr Kenneth Ugbala, announced the dissolution on the State-owned radio station. Ugbala said, “His Excellency, the Governor of Ebonyi State, Dr David Nweze Umahi, has approved the removal from office of the following coordinators of development centres in Ebonyi State: 1. Okorie Daniel of Ivo D/C; and 2. Fabian Ivoke of Echiele D/C. “Consequently, the two former officials are directed to hand over all government property in their possession to the Secretary to the State Government/coordinating commissioner before the close of work on Thursday, November 26, 2020. Please, ensure strict compliance to the directive.” Copyright PUNCH.
