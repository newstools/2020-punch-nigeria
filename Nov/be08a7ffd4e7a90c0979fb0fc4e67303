Patrick Odey, Uyo The National Secretary of All Progressives Congress, Senator John Udoedghe, on Monday called on those nursing the 2023 governorship ambition under the platform of the party to stop fighting among themselves, saying he remained the authentic candidate of the party for the election. Udoedghe stated this at a media briefing in to mark his 57th birthday anniversary at the NUJ Secretariat, Uyo, the state capital. He said, “When I led opposition in Akwa Ibom State many years ago, those who were fighting me were in PDP. “Now all those who were fighting me are now in APC and they have perfected their plans to fight me again even in APC that they hated.” The former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory enjoined Akwa Ibom Ibom people to vote for the party in 2023 to attract development to the state. He blamed the youths for planning to outsmart their elders by floating juvenile party against the elders in 2023 saying such moves were counterproductive. He said, “When I became the chairman of the Uyo Local Governmrnt Area at the age of 33 , I never disrespect my elders. As a Senator, I was the Chairman Senate Committee on Privatisation without smiting my elders. Why should the youths  plan to bench their elders now? Copyright PUNCH.
