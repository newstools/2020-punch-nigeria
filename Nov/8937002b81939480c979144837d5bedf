Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt The Rivers State Police Command on Wednesday uncovered a dead infant abandoned in a refuse dump by an unknown person. PUNCH Metro learnt that residents of Egede community, Mile 2, in the Diobu area of Port Harcourt, who had gone to dispose of their refuse, discovered the lifeless male infant on the floor wearing only a diaper. Police officers attached to the Mile 2 divisional headquarters, who were informed about the baby, removed the corpse. A witness, who refused to give his name, told our correspondent that the baby, which appeared to be a day old, was discovered around 9pm on the floor. He added that some used syringes and injections were found close to the body. “Alarm was raised by the first set of persons who came to dispose of their waste at the dump, attracting a large crowd to the place. This resulted in heavy traffic on Ikwerre Road, but the police later came and removed the baby,” he said. A spokesman for the state police command, Nnamdi Omoni, confirmed the incident. Omoni said, “Before our men got to the scene, the baby was already dead. We have intensified investigation into the incident to unravel what happened and to bring to book any person found culpable.” Copyright PUNCH.
