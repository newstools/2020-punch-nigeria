Deji Lambo A non-governmental organisation, Concerned Ikorodu Division Youths, has urged the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to include a representative from the Ikorodu division in the list of nominees for the Lagos State Local Government Service Commission. Speaking during a press conference in Ikorodu, the group Coordinator, Kunle Adelabu, said Ikorodu was excluded from the list of nominees for the commission released by the Head of Service, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola. He said, “Our protest is borne out of the incessant shortchanging and marginalisation of the Ikorodu division, which is gradually becoming a practice in the state. Just about two years back, the representative of the Ikorodu division in the Lagos State House of Assembly Service Commission was replaced by someone from another division. We have also been denied membership of the audit commission. “The recently approved list of chairman and members of the Lagos State Local Government Service Commission, with the exclusion of Ikorodu division, yet again, does not only expose a presumed resentment against the division, but also berates some extant laws, especially Section 14(4) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended.” Copyright PUNCH.
