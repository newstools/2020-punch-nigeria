France fly-half Romain Ntamack has been ruled out of Sunday’s Autumn Nations Cup match against Scotland due to injury, the coaching staff announced Monday. Ntamack, 21, will be replaced by uncapped Toulon fly-half Louis Carbonel, the French rugby federation said without specifying the nature of the injury. Toulouse star Ntamack was the leading points scorer in this year’s Six Nations as France narrowly missed out on a first title since the 2010 tournament. Carbonel is a two-time under-20 world champion with France. The country’s opening match of the new Autumn Nations competition was cancelled at the weekend after a number of Fiji players tested positive for Covid-19. France will next travel to Edinburgh to face Scotland, who handed Les Bleus their only defeat under coach Fabien Galthie — a 28-17 loss in March just before the coronavirus pandemic interrupted the Six Nations.
