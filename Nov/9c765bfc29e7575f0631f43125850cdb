Samson Folarin and Gibson Achonu The Imo State Commissioner of Police, Mr Isaac Akinmoyede, has directed investigation into a recent protest by some youths in Umuariam/Umuasonye community, in the Obowo Local Government Area of Imo State. He said the investigation would identify policemen attached to influential people, their principals, as well as the posting authority of the cops. PUNCH Metro had reported that some youths protested against two residents, Chibueze Adiele and Prince Uhuegbu Onyemauche, who they alleged used their security detail to intimidate and harass community members. Akinmoyede, through the state Police Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu, said the cops attached to the men were not from the state command. “The command wishes to state that prior to the protest, no report has been received regarding any harassment, intimidation or detention of anyone as claimed by the protesters. The command therefore calls on members of the public to always report any such infractions or unethical conduct of police officers through the following numbers for prompt and appropriate disciplinary actions, which are: 08037104988 and 07034714499,” he added. Meanwhile, Onyemauche has denied allegations of harassing any residents, saying the protest by the community youths was sponsored. In a telephone conversation with PUNCH Metro, the businessman alleged that ‘street urchins’ were paid N2,000 each to participate in the demonstration. “There was no time any police with me harassed anybody. I have not even been in the village. Since the #EndSARS protest, most of the VIPs stopped travelling with their policemen,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
