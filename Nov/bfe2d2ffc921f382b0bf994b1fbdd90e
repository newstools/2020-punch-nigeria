Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Movement for the Survival of Ijaw (Izon) Ethnic Nationality in the Niger Delta, (Central Zone), has faulted the decision of the Bayelsa State Assembly to grant a N17bn loan request by Governor Douye Diri. The zonal chairman of MOSIEND, Taribolou Ogboriyo, expressed the group’s displeasure at a press briefing in Yenagoa, on Monday. The House had on Thursday given approval to a request by Diri to collect the N17b loan from multiple sources to fund his administration’s policies and programmes. Ogboriyo described the action of the House as painful and ill-timed, especially as Bayelsa had been classified among the top five poorest states in Nigeria. The MOSIEND leader said, “First of all, we are very displeased over the actions of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly for approving the loan of N17 billion which was requested by Governor Douye Diri for reasons best known to them. “MOSIEND frowns on the development because it was ill-timed and not in the interest of the people of the state. We want to put it on record that the Bayelsa State House of Assembly is to blame for the indebtedness of Bayelsa, because they always approve every executive bill sent to the House. “Since the prosperity government came on board, we have not seen any sign of development except the minor work going on at Tombia Junction, and several monies have come into the state within this period of nine months that this government came into power, yet, this has not translated into development.” Copyright PUNCH.
