Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, on Monday said that the war against the Boko Haram insurgency terrorists was taking too long saying that it is shameful that it had not ended. He stated this on while receiving the House of Representatives Committee on Army during a courtesy visit at the Government House. Mohammed said, “The House of Representatives is led by one of the most competent legislators, that is Hon Femi Gbajabiamila. “That’s why most of the members of committee are from the North-East, I know why he did that. “Please, make us safe. If is not dealt with, it is a shame because it is taking too long.” Mohammed said sophistication of criminals like bandits and cattle rustlers has forced the army to do the duty of the police. “The Army is always yearning for equipment and manpower and they are overstretched, the ratio of citizens to Nigeria Army is very large. “This cattle rustling, kidnapping which is the responsibility of police has become that of the army, because the criminals are armed with sophisticated weapons like AK-47. The hands of Nigerian Army are full; we need to provide them with maximum facilities for improved service.” Earlier, the Chairman of the House Committee on Nigerian Army, AbdulRasak Namdaz, lamented that the hands of the Army was full with going one or more operations in over 24 states of the federation.
