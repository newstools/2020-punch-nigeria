Some coordinators of the #EndSARS movement in Osun State have given the state government a seven-working day ultimatum to increase the salaries and allowances of its workers. The movement, on Friday, in a statement co-signed by its Spokesperson, Olawale Bakare and Mobilisation Secretary, Olushayo Ogunleye, rejected the recent increase in salaries announced by the government and demanded a review. The group said only five per cent increase was effected on the basic salaries of workers. The statement read in part, “This height of hypocrisy owing to the recent fraudulent five per cent increase in the basic salary of workers from level 7 and beyond (sic). By implication, the workers being paid the paltry sum of N15,000 will now have just N750 added to their basic salary. This is sadly what Mr Governor wants to be worshipped for. “We hereby reject this fraudulent and enslaving mode of payment, and demand an increased review of the salaries and allowances of Osun State workers, within the next seven working days.” They also called on Governor Adegboyega Oyetola to give each of the families of the two people killed during the #EndSARS protest in the state a sum of N10 Million. “Failure to address the aforementioned demands within seven working days, Mr Governor Gboyega Oyetola should resign and allow a more competent and humane leader to govern the state,” the statement read.
