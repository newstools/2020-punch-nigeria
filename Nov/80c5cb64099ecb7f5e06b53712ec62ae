Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The Kaduna State High Court sitting in Zaria will on Friday (today), rule on the interlocutory injunction brought before it by one of the contestants to the Zazzau Emirate stool, the Iyan Zazzau, Alhaji Bashir Aminu. After both counsel for the plaintiff and defendant presented their arguments for and against the application filed by the plaintiff at the resumed hearing of the suit on Wednesday, Justice Kabir Sabo ruled that court would rule on the application on 6th November, 2020. Apart from Governor Nasir El-Rufai, others joined in the suit include the Attorney-General of Kaduna State, Kaduna State Council of Chiefs, Zazzau Emirate Council and Amb. Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli. In the process which was filed by Yunus Usman, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, the Iyan Zazzau urged the court to declare him the Emir having scored the highest votes cast by the kingmakers. He also, among others, sought “an order setting aside the purported appointment of the 10th defendant, Ambassador Ahmad Bamalli, as the Emir of Zazzau. “An order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendants either by themselves, agents, privies, servants or through any person or persons howsoever from treating, presenting or dealing with or installing the 10th defendant as the Emir of Zazzau.” The plaintiff had argued that the Zazzau Emirate kingmakers had forwarded a list of three shortlisted princes – Bashir Aminu, Iyan Zazzau; Munir Jafaru, Yariman Zazzau; Aminu Shehu Idris, Turakin Karamin Zazzau – to El-Rufai for appointment as the new emir. He said the exercise was annulled and a fresh nomination was directed by the state government. Copyright PUNCH.
