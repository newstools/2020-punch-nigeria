Joseph Olaoluwa The management of the Nigerian Ports Authority has been advised to adjust their budget to reflect the damages suffered after the recent attack on it’s headquarters by hoodlums. This was the suggestion made by a delegation of the National Assembly after assessing the extent of the damage on the Lagos head office of the NPA. NPA Managing Director, Hadiza Bala-Usman, conducted the House Chairman on Ports and Habours, Garba Muhammad and Vice Chairman of Senate Committee on Marine Transport, Tolulope Odebiyi, on a post disaster assessment tour of the building on Thursday. The legislators pledged to support NPA to accommodate the cost of repairs and replacements as well as certain aspects which insurance could not cover. Muhammad commiserated with the management of NPA, stressing that the National Assembly would assist the authority in rebuilding. He said, “As a National Assembly, we are here to cooperate with the NPA, assist them in the legislature to rebuild this building  and that is our primary reason for coming here and we have seen the damages. “The NPA is just about to bring its budget to the National Assembly, so after going round, we have advised them to readjust the budget to accommodate this inferno that has taken place.” He added, “We are also aware that some of the critical infrastructure and vehicles are insured. We know the insurance company cannot pay for the whole damages.” Copyright PUNCH.
