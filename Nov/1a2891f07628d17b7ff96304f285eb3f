Adelani Adepegba, Abuja One of the prominent faces of the #EndSARS movement, Deji Adeyanju, has filed a complaint against a lawyer, Kenechukwu Okeke, before the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee for “acts unbecoming of a legal practitioner.” The petition dated November 11, 2020, was also supported by an affidavit filed at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, sitting in Abuja. The action against Okeke was sequel to the criminal complaint he filed against 50 #EndSARS campaigners before a Chief Magistrates Court in Abuja, for their alleged roles in the protests, which he said resulted in the looting and destruction of property. In the case instituted on Monday pursuant to sections 88, 109(a), 110(1)(c) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015, Okeke listed prominent persons including entertainers and social media influencers as the defendants. The lawyer alleged that his properties were destroyed during the riot, noting that the defendants should be brought to justice over his loss. Those listed as defendants include musician Damini Ogulu aka Burna Boy, David Adeleke popularly known as Davido, Folarin Falana, aka Falz; social media comedians, Debo Adebayo aka Mr Macaroni, and Maryam Akpaokagi aka Taoma. He also listed some activists, including Adeyanju, Aisha Yesufu, Feyikemi Abudu, Olorunrinu Oduala, Pamilerin Adegoke, Japhet Omojuwa, Ayo Sogunro and others. Following Adeyanju’s petition, the LPDC said, “Okeke of Gana Street, Maitama, Abuja, is required to answer to the allegations contained in the statement/affidavit which accompanies this application and that such order be made as the committee shall think right.” If found guilty, the LPDC may suspend the lawyer from the bar for at least one year.
