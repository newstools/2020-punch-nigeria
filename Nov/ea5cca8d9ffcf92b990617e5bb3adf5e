John Alechenu, Abuja The Director General of the Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, has said the desire of component units of the federation for the devolution of power will make more sense when the stage was set for economic prosperity. He explained that the quest by the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to lift 100 million people out of poverty within 10 years, was possible with massive investments in agriculture. Okechukwu said this at a media briefing, in Abuja, on Wednesday.

China, India and even the USA do not have that median youth advantage, only Brazil and Indonesia approximate our ranking. However, this advantage also has disadvantages, this is what #BUGREV is set to correct. “Our desire for devolution of powers or restructuring, will make better sense, and be more meaningful, for without economic prosperity, risorgimento of the middle class; restructuring no matter how well designed, will only reinforce the Emperorship of our Governors.” Copyright PUNCH.
