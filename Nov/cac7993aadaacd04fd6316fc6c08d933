Gibson Achonu, Owerri A former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha has appealed to his successor, Governor Hope Uzodinma, to stop the destruction of his legacy projects in the state. Okorocha, made the appeal on Tuesday. He was reacting to the demolition of the Somtochukwu Hospital, built during his administration. The former governor who now represents Imo West Senatorial District, in the Senate, said, “A fight against Rochas Okorocha must be separated with that of Imo state asset. “My key projects are left to rot in Imo. My heart bleeds over the present demolition of Somto Hospital. Fight me alone don’t fight the people of Imo state. Why do you fight the properties of the Imo state government?” However, the Secretary of the Imo state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, Chief Ray Emeana, accused Okorocha of the same crime he was accusing his successor of. Emeana expressed regret that Okorocha, equally destroyed the long existing Eke Ukwu Owerri market during his time in office. He said, “Imo is very unlucky. It is only God that will forgive us. Since Dee Sam Mbakwe’s government in this state, the next governor that has meant well for the state was Emeka Ihedioha. After him, it was all very selfish governments. I support the aforesaid because Okorocha had destroyed the market where the poor in the society sustained their lives from. “The same APC that demolished the market is the same party that is demolishing the structure now. This is not what Imo people need as at now, where workers have not been paid their salaries, pensions hanging and hunger ravaging the entire society”.Copyright PUNCH.
