South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa and US President-elect Joe Biden are eager to boost relations between America and the African continent, the presidency said after a phone call between the two leaders. Ramaphosa, who is also the current chairman of the African Union, “is hopeful of a strong partnership between the United States and the African continent in promoting peace and stability in international relations and advancing multilateralism,” his office said in a statement after the call late Tuesday. “Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have identified Africa as a major player in international affairs and in the advancement of multilateralism,” it said.
