Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki A Member of the House of Representatives, Teejay Yusuf, Ijumu/Kabba-Bunu Federal Constituency, on Sunday, cautioned the All Progressives Congress against opening its doors for the Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi. The law maker gave the words of caution in a Facebook post on Sunday. Yusuf said, Umahi’s coming into the ruling party was billed to dent its image, adding, “Any political office holder who is in the habit of arresting, suppressing and banning journalists is not morally fit to be in the APC.” He further said, “Umahi is a dictator; he is deceitful and has from to time shown that he hates democratic tendencies. Allowing such a person into the party is like introducing deceit, dictatorship and other anti-democratic tendencies into the APC. “This is a leader who doesn’t want freedom of the press and has from time to time arrested, threatened and banned journalists in his state. Such cannot be a part of APC; he is deceitful and dictatorial.” However, an Ebonyi State leader of the APC, Sen. Julius Ucha, dismissed Yusuf’s concerns. He said, Umahi will be a great asset to the APC and the people of the South-East zone. Ucha said, “The Lawmaker, Hon. Teejay Yusuf, is just funny. How can he say that APC is inheriting their problem when the PDP has been sending delegations to help stop Umahi from joining APC? Umahi is a great asset to APC. “His achievement is a veritable tool of marketing and advertisement for APC. Copyright PUNCH.
