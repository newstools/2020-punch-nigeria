Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti EKITI State Government on Wednesday doused the tension among candidates, parents and education stakeholders in the state over the withholding of the 2020 Senior School Certificate Examination results by the West African Examination Council. The state government promised that the results would be released this week. Tension mounted in the state as candidates and their parents, who besieged the schools and cybercafés to check the results for the examination, were made to realise that the results were being withheld by WAEC. The exam body had in a statement on Monday announced the release of the results of the 2020 WASSCE. But parents became agitated when they learnt about the withholding of the results in Ekiti State, especially against the backdrop of rumour that the state government was indebted to the examination body to the tune of several millions of naira being the free WAEC fee declared for all students in public schools by Governor Kayode Fayemi. The state Commissioner for Information, Mr Akin Omole, who debunked the allegation of the state’s indebtedness to WAEC, said the results were put on hold owing to computation mistake. Omole said, “The seizure was caused by the mistakes made in some of the ways the results were computed. The issue of Ekiti owing money doesn’t arise; it was a blatant lie. The government immediately contacted WAEC and it tendered apologies to the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
