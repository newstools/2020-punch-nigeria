Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The crisis rocking the Ogun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, has taken a new twist as a faction loyal to the late Senator Buruji Kashamu, has split over the alleged suspension of its Chairman, Samson Bamgbose, and other party officials for alleged “anti – party activities.” They were reportedly suspended by a faction within the State Executive Committee of the party loyal to Kashamu at an extra-ordinary meeting held on November 9. Boladale Sanni from the Yewa North Local Government Area was subsequently appointed as the acting chairman of the party. According to the faction, other suspended Exco members are Chief Kehinde Oladeinde (ex-State Deputy Chairman), Barr. Kunle Bolujoko (ex-Ogun East Senatorial Chairman), Mrs. Bimbo Lanre-Balogun (ex-State Woman Leader), Hon.  Sunmola Kayode (ex-Ogun West Senatorial Chairman), Alh. Kola Akinyemi (ex-Ogun Central Senatorial Chairman) and Hon. Alaba Adewunmi (ex-State Auditor). The faction said, Bamgbose, has been referred to the party’s National Executive Committee for further disciplinary action. The other suspended exco members are to appear before a seven-man disciplinary committee headed by Dr. Remilekun Bakare. However, Bamgbose countered the group, dismissing the suspensions as a “nullity and unbelievable.” The embattled chairman said he had nine out of 14-man State Working Committee of the PDP on his side, noting that the mastermind of suspension lacked powers to do so. Addressing newsmen in Abeokuta on Monday, he said, “The PDP executives in Ogun State are intact and unshaken under the leadership of Samson Bamgbose, A few weeks ago, we placed them on suspension. They were suspended in November 3, 2020.” Copyright PUNCH.
