Olalekan Adetayo The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Friday commiserated with a former Senate Leader, Victor Ndoma-Egba, over the death of his wife, Amaka. Amaka was said to have died in an auto crash on Friday. Buhari’s condolence message was contained in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, titled “President Buhari commiserates with Senator Ndoma-Egba over death of wife.” Also, the Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr Orji Kalu, commiserated with Ndoma-Egba. Kalu described the deceased as a supportive and kind-hearted wife. Meanwhile, Ndoma-Egba has described his late wife, Amaka, as an angel, stating that “a trailer ran into their vehicle around Ore and four of them died on the spot.” “She was an angel. Angels don’t live on earth. So, she has gone home,” he noted. Ndoma-Egba has suffered a series of tragedies lately.
