Angela Onwuzoo The Nigerian Medical Association,  Cross River State chapter, says four doctors were kidnapped at various times in the state this year. The  state chairman of NMA, Dr. Innocent Abang, disclosed this during an exclusive interview with PUNCH HealthWise on Friday. He also demanded the safe release of their colleague, Dr. Godwin Udo, of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital who was kidnapped in the state recently. Dr. Abanghad, on Wednesday, announced that doctors in the state had commenced an indefinite strike pending the unconditional release of their colleague. Speaking with our correspondent on the development, he said, “The indefinite strike is a moral issue. We don’t have that kind of mind to continue working when a doctor is off and it could be anybody because this is one doctor too many. “It is not like a random thing, it is well orchestrated by these people. So, we feel that if we can be treating the public and people have the mind to kidnap doctors, then our services are not important to them. “If the doctor is working and not psychologically balanced, then the patient he is treating is also at risk. “So, it is better we get out of it. We are not in the best frame of mind to attend to any patient. That is why we decided to down tools until we are in the best frame of mind. When we have our friend and colleague released, then we can work.” To continue reading this story and more, click here Copyright PUNCH.
