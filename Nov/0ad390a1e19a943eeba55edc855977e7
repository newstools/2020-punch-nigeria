Peter Dada, Akure In a bid to boost its revenue generation, the Ondo State Internal Revenue Service on Monday inaugurated a Joint State Revenue Committee, comprising members of the service and chairmen of 18 council areas in the state. Speaking at the inauguration, the Chairman of ODIRS, Mr Tolu Adegbie, explained that the joint committee was a product of the Ondo State Revenue Administration Law of 2019. He said, “The function of the committee is to harmonise tax administration in the state, deal with revenue matters of common concern to the state and local government authorities.” The chairman noted that ODIRS had achieved 99 per cent of its N24bn target for 2020. “For the state, we have reviewed the N24bn target from N30bn because of the COVID-19 effects.” I think we are close. As we speak, as of October, we have achieved 99 per cent and you know that it will increase in November and December. We hope to meet up,” he stated. Copyright PUNCH.
