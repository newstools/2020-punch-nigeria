Samson Folarin The Dangote Group has sensitised school pupils and women to the importance of keeping safety guidelines to reduce the spread of coronavirus. A statement said a team of volunteers from the company visited schools in the Ikoyi and its environs and donated items, including face masks and sanitisers to the people. On Wednesday, the team, along with a doctor, were said to have met with the Police Officers Wives Association and the Army Wives Association to spread the message of “staying safe together.” The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Aliko Dangote Foundation, Zouera Youssoufou, said the initiative was borne out of the yearly sustainable week celebrated by the company. “This is to show we are sustainable as an organisation dealing with issues with the environment, our community and how we are living in harmony with the people who are our neighbours. “The theme of this year’s sustainability week is volunteering and we went to schools, churches and mosques, educating people on how to keep safe,” she said. The Head of Sustainability, Dangote Group, Eunice Samson, said the team also donated materials and machines to facilitate washing of hands in some of the places visited. Copyright PUNCH.
