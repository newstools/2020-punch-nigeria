Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri, has described former President Goodluck Jonathan, as the face of democracy and a strong advocate of peaceful elections across the world. Diri said this at a funeral for Jonathan’s cousin, the late Nitabai Inengite, at Otuoke, in the Ogbia Local Government Area, on Saturday. Until his demise on June 19, the late Inengite was a former senior official of a university. He was 68. The deceased was kidnapped by gunmen in 2014 and 2016 The governor, who was represented at the event by the Deputy Governor of the state, Mr. Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, said the historic phone call Jonathan made to concede defeat to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in 2015, saved Nigeria’s democracy. He said, “We all know what is happening in the United States, a country most of us regarded as the best example of democracy. But considering what Trump is doing with his supporters, you will agree that our father (Dr Jonathan) did what so many leaders in the world cannot do. “Our brother and father has elevated Nigeria above the United States. I say this with all sense of responsibility because when you compare the margin of defeat in 2015 and the margin of defeat today in the US, you can know the difference. “But our father, for the love of self and love of all of us, and for the love our country and the African continent, relinquished power without any doubt.” The governor condoled with the bereaved family and prayed God to grant the entire community the fortitude to bear the loss. In his remarks, Jonathan expressed gratitude to the governor, the deputy governor and all those who took out time to attend the funeral. Copyright PUNCH.
