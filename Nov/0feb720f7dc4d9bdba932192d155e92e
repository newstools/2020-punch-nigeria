Chima Azubuike, Gombe The member of the Gombe State Assembly representing Akko Central, State Constituency of Gombe State, Abubakar Luggerewo, was on Tuesday, sworn in as the 7th speaker of the state Assembly, replacing Ibrahim Abubakar. Our correspondent gathered that this was done through a voice vote by 16 out of 24 members of the House of Assembly comprising 20 APC and four PDP members. Luggerewo, aged 36 years, was sworn in by the deputy speaker, Siddi Buba, who represents Kwami West constituency. Former deputy speaker, Shuaibu Adamu, announced the names of the 16 members that passed the voice vote and the motion of impeachment which was moved by Saddam Bello, representing Funakaye constituency. Buba said, “The former Speaker of the house was removed due to lack of confidence. We lost confidence in his leadership and as a house, we are at liberty to change leadership. Once you lack confidence in someone then there has been breach. We felt the best thing was to remove him and replace with a brand-new speaker.” Majority leader, Samuel Markus, was also removed via a voice vote the result of which was announced by Mustapha Usman, representing Gombe South. He was replaced by Ladan Yerima, representing Kaltungo East constituency. The Deputy chief whip, Yahaya Kaka was also replaced by Saddam Bello, representing Funakaye constituency. Security operatives thwarted attempts by suspected hoodlums suspected to be loyalists of the ousted speaker. The impeachment was coming one year after Shuaibu Adamu, was removed over his alleged loyalty to Governor Inuwa Yahaya. Copyright PUNCH.
