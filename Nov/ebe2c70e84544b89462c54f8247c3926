Peter Dada,  Akure The Akeredolu Campaign Organisation has condemned a recent statement credited to the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the last governorship election,  Mr Eyitayo Jegede, saying some people were after his life . Jegede in a statement by his campaign organization, alleged that some people were being threatened by his petition challenging Akeredolu’s victory at the Election Petition Tribunal and that these people had hatched a plan to get rid of him . However, in a statement, titled “Akeredolu to Jegede: Face your petition, stop seeking attention,” issued on Monday, by the spokesperson of Akeredolu Campaign Organization,  Mr. Richard Olatunde, the Akeredolu campaign team said, “It is clear that while the resounding victory of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu against Jegede’s expectation is no longer news, the PDP candidate perhaps still lives in an unfortunate illusion. “Without prejudice to the tribunal, we make bold to say that the alarm raised by Jegede over what he termed ‘threat to life’ is an evasive strategy to further hoodwink his unsuspecting followers into believing in his legal voyage which has held them spellbound. “If anything, Jegede should look within his party, the PDP and beam searchlight into its leadership crisis, particularly the internal wrangling which has led to the brickbats as seen in the media lately.” Copyright PUNCH.
