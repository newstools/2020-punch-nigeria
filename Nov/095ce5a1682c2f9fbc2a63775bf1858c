Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Federal Government on Monday raised concerns over “flagrant disregard” for the established COVID-19 protocols in government offices. It directed all permanent secretaries to enforce the recommended measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The directive was contained in a circular by the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan, dated November 23, 2020. Yemi-Esan said government workers and visitors had not been wearing face masks as recommended. She also noted that instructions on physical distancing and regular washing of hands were being disregarded. The circular reads partly, “With great dismay, it has been observed that some officers and visitors to the offices exhibit flagrant disregard to the established COVID-19 protocols by not wearing face masks and failing to abide by other required regulations. “Consequent upon the above, Permanent Secretaries should deepen and sustain awareness, as well as ensure enforcement of other recommended measures to prevent the spread of the pandemic as contained in the COVID-19 guidelines. The guidelines can be accessed on the website of the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation.”
