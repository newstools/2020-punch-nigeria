Kayode Oyero Former Nigerian Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, on Monday, took to Twitter to tag United States Vice-President-Elect, Kamala Harris, as ‘Jezebel’. Fani-Kayode, an unapologetic supporter of incumbent President Donald Trump, who lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden, for the umpteenth time today, expressed disappointment over the outcome of the US presidential poll. The PUNCH had reported that the former minister said it was not over yet for the Republican candidate until the Supreme Court decided on the election which major western media said Biden won last Saturday. Fani-Kayode, however, lauded Russian President, Vladimir Putin, who announced Monday that he would wait for the official results before congratulating a winner in the keenly contested poll. Harris, who is the first female vice-president-elect in the history of America, has been praised locally and globally by social and political figures including former Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo, who said she has the Nigerian DNA. But the former minister tweeted on Monday, alleging, “I know Jezebel when I see her. Look into Kamala’s eyes. Kaballa + Kundalini = Kamala. Biden is a puppet and a smokescreen. A Biden presidency is a Kamala Presidency. A Kamala Presidency is satan’s Presidency. May God deliver. #CountEveryLegalVote” Fani-Kayode’s label on Harris as Jezebel, an unpopular biblical character and wife of King Ahab, who ruled the kingdom of Israel, drew the ire of Nigerians on Twitter who lambasted the ex-minister. @renzeldabawse, replied, “I m highly disappointed in you sir….this is totally uncalled for.” @Billzee2010 said, “A serial divorcee has now become a seer and prophet. God help us in this country.” @the_realabolade wrote, “It doesn’t matter if one is a graduate of Cambridge, foolishness knows no place of institution. So you now know Jezebel by looking into her eyes, referring to Kamala. This man here can’t take care of his household but knows who Jezebel is.” @darlwright77 tweeted, “So disrespectful to call someone’s mother and wife a Jezebel! No matter our political inclination, there are certain words or statement that shouldn’t be used to address women mostly responsible mothers!” @WahabGrace wrote, “Why are you so bittered about @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris win? Must @realDonaldTrump win? You are taking this too personal.” @__adddyyy tweeted, “You probably said same about your ex-wives. Leave this one out. Leave her eyes alone.” @SalaamYusuff1 stated, “Were you promised appointment if @realDonaldTrump returns or he’s the one bankrolling you?”
