Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, on Sunday, exonorated his colleagues from the allegation that they deliberately hoarded the palliatives items in their respective states. Many warehouses in various states were looted by the people after the #EndSARS protests. Akeredolu, who is also the Chairman of South-West Governors’ Forum, said the insistence on official flag-off ceremony by the Coalition Against COVID-19 before the distribution was largely responsible for the delay in distributing the items to the people of the states. The governor stated this while speaking at the church service marking the 3rd anniversary of enthronement of the Bishop of Owo Diocese, the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, Dr. Stephen Fagbemi, held at the All Saints Church Idasen Owo, Ondo State. He said, “Those states where the palliatives were warehoused, were also waiting for the donation of the remaining items and flag-off by the CA-COVID-19.” Akeredolu also explained that Ondo State was saved from the looting spree due to the continuous distribution of the palliatives. On his re-election, Akeredolu described his victory at the October 10, governorship election as God’s project which no man could truncate, assuring that his re-election by the people of the state could not be tampered with.
