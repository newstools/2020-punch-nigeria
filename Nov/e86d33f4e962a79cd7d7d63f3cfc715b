The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Malam Mele Kyari, said that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), never interfered in the operations of the Corporation. Kyari disclosed this at a media interaction with the National Association of Energy Correspondents in Abuja, on Friday. He said the corporation had the full support of the president to operate effectively for the growth of the industry, “I can tell you that the privilege we have today in this company of having unfettered control without any distraction or interference to make decisions and be accountable and responsible for our decisions has never happened until this government. “I can tell you this because I have been around for 29 years and have worked closely with the top management of the NNPC for about 15 years. “This is the only president who has never asked NNPC to do something. “I have the personal privilege to have access to Mr President, to his private audience and I can tell you that under no circumstances has he controlled what we want to do. “He only wants to know and be sure that what we are doing is in the best interest of the country,” he said He said that migrating to the deregulation of the downstream oil sector was a huge challenge and difficult decision for the president as he understood the pain it would put ordinary Nigerian through. According to him, the president supported the decision because the government can no longer afford subsidies with harsh economic impact of COVID-19. NAN
