Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta THE Ogun State Government says the deworming drugs being administered on school-age children in 14 local government areas in the state are not poisonous. The Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, said this on Thursday, in the wake of the news making the rounds that two school-children in Abeokuta died from complications occasioned by the drugs. Coker said the same drug was administered on her alongside other top government functionaries at the flag-off of the exercise. She added that the drugs were administered on 249 pupils of the said school out of which two children who lived within the same compound were said to be stooling and vomiting on getting home. According to the commissioner, these signs are not part of the symptoms of side effects of the deworming drugs. The commissioner, who paid a condolence visit to the house of the deceased children on Wednesday, pleaded for the release of the corpse which had not been buried and ordered for an investigation. The statement read, “It was discovered that the episode of gastroenteritis suffered by the two children suggests a possible water-borne disease; cholera. “Investigation led by the Ogun State Commissioner for Health along with officials of the  Federal Ministry of Health and Abeokuta South Local Government, revealed that the children died of severe case of vomiting and diarrhea.” Copyright PUNCH.
