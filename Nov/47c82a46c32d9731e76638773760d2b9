John Alechenu, Abuja The Director General of the Progressives Governors’ Forum, Dr. Salihu Lukman, has enjoined elected and appointed leaders of the All Progressives Congress to be more accommodating of citizens’ demands. He also urged leaders to stop considering citizens’ demands as “disagreements and subversive,” when such demands do not correspond with their position. Lukeman said this in a position paper titled: “Nigerian Democracy and Challenge of Interests’ Negotiation,” made available to newsmen, in Abuja, on Sunday. The PGF is the umbrella body of governors elected on the platform of the APC. Lukeman said, “As a party, APC is far ahead of its political peers in terms of being a liberal party with strong internal contestation. “But such liberalism is yet to produce the corresponding requirement for interest representation and negotiation within the party, which is responsible for why our elected and appointed political leaders in the party estimate citizens’ demands as disagreement and subversive when it doesn’t correspond to their positions. “It is also why fellow party leaders would appear intolerant to positions of other party leaders regarding both citizens’ demands and internal disagreements. “We need to appeal to our leaders at all levels, especially in APC to liberate themselves and shed off any fear of citizens’ engagement, internal disagreements, political negotiations and the possible compromises that may emerge both within the party and in the country. “Fear of citizens’ engagement and political negotiations is largely what is emboldening political opponents whose credentials on this score are anything but attractive.” Copyright PUNCH.
