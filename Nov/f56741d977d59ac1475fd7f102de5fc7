Kayode Oyero Femi Adesina, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), says he looks forward to his exit as presidential spokesman. Adesina, in a piece on Friday titled, ‘We have different paths to tread in life,’ said “even life does not last forever”. He, however, said only God knows his terminal time and “it’s in the womb of time. But the longest is 2023…We have our entrances and exits. I look forward to mine.” Adesina, who expressed concerns over certain comments by his detractors, stressed that nobody could determine his destiny after 2023. In the piece published on his website, www.femiadesina.com, he listed those who served as image-makers to the nation’s heads of state since 1976, noting that they all succeeded after office and his is not going to be an exception. He also wrote about his professional odyssey from a reporter to the status of a newspaper editor-in-chief before his appointment by the President in 2015. The former President of Nigerian Guild of Editors stated, “On the very first day in my current office, I already handed over the last day to God. The last day would always come. Even life does not last forever. “Why have I decided to write this piece? The ill will, malediction I hear from some tiny, envious quarters. He is now anti-people, because he’s S.A to the President. He will go down. He will come back to meet us, unheralded, unsung. He will be uncelebrated. Really? I dey laff. Who are they talking about. Me? No. It can’t be me, because my destiny was long hidden in Christ and in God. “Those who served before me have all succeeded in their different ways, no matter what people choose to believe, or say of them. They served their principals faithfully. I will do same to mine. Nobody will determine what happens next. Only God will do. We have different paths to tread in life. And it is determined by the higher powers.”
