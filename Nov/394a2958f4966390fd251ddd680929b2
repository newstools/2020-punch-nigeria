Kayode Oyero US President Donald Trump has accused his opponents of electoral malpractices in Tuesday presidential election. According to the Republican candidate, his opponents are casting votes after polls are closed. “We are up big but they are trying to steal the election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the polls are closed!” he tweeted. Already, polls have closed across the United States and a long night of waiting for results lies ahead. As of the time of filing this report, US media claimed Trump won 23 states with 213 electoral votes while Biden won 20 states with 238 electoral votes. The magic number of electoral votes is 270 and no winner has emerged so far as there are seven states yet to be called. A record number of ballots were cast before Election Day, totalling more than 100 million, due to fears of congregating in polling stations in person during the coronavirus pandemic.
