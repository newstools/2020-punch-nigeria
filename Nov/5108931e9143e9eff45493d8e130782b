’Femi Asu Momas Electricity Meters Manufacturing Company has said it is set to train over 300 unemployed youths on effective electricity metering programme scheme to complement Federal Government’s effort on the massive rollout of metering into the power sector. The Chairman, MEMMCOL, Mr Kola Balogun, was quoted in a statement on Sunday as saying the idea was to extend the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility to some states to develop manpower capability among unemployed youths. Balogun said the initiative would enhance the meter manufacturing subsector of the power sector, adding, “The extension is to develop manpower skills to be able to install the meter.” According to him, participants in the free metering installation training programme will be selected from the six geopolitical zones of the country, and the first phase will last for two weeks. He said, “Momas, as a key stakeholder in the downstream of the power sector, sees the initiative as viable way to create employment opportunities for our youths. “Momas also identified that there is an urgent need to train more Nigeria on electricity meter installation to complement the Presidential directive.” Copyright PUNCH.
