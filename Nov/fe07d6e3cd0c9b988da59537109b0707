Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Sunday announced that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), will roll out the National Gas Expansion Programme on Tuesday. It stated that based on this, one million vehicles would be converted to run on autogas before the end of 2021. The Special Assistant on Media to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Garba Deen Muhammad, said in a statement issued in Abuja that the NGEP event would herald the formal dispensing of autogas products at two retail stations. The autogas products include Compressed Natural Gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas, while the two filling stations selected for the formal dispensing of the products were retail outlets of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. Muhammad said the roll out was the culmination of the resolve of government to deepen domestic usage of natural gas in its various forms. Copyright PUNCH.
