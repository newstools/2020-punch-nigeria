Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Federal High Court in Yenagoa, has dismissed a suit seeking to disqualify a former governor of Bayelsa State and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr. Seriake Dickson, from contesting the Bayelsa West senatorial by-election. The case was filed by one Eneoriekumoh Owoupele, who hails from the same Sagbama Local Government Area as Dickson. Owoupele had alleged in the suit No. FHC/YNG/CS/72/2020 that the Independent National Electoral Commission Form EC9, which the PDP candidate submitted to the commission, contained false information.
