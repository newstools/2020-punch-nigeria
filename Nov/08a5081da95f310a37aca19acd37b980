Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has earmarked N11.3bn to strengthen the state’s healthcare system and provide quality healthcare services to Edo people next year. While N1bn will be expended on contribution to the state Health Insurance Scheme, the other N10.3 billion will be used to strengthen institutions and systems required to provide affordable and quality healthcare service to the people. Obaseki noted that the 2021 budget, which had been presented to the  Assembly, was primed at strengthening the state’s health care system, sustaining gains in the education and social sectors and providing needed stimulus to drive food security, supporting the weak and vulnerable in our society and actively engaging our youths. He said,  “The new design is that, with the pilot building of 20 primary health care centres for each local government to test it and the expansion to about 60, our hope is to get about 250 PHCs in the next one and half years. “In supporting a robust response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we would be reinforcing structures to support provision of effective and efficient Medicare at the local government area level.” Copyright PUNCH.
