The Nigerian Communications Commission has pledged more collaboration with universities in the country towards transforming Nigeria into a knowledge-based economy. The Chairman of NCC board, Prof. Adeolu Akande, said this while paying a courtesy visit on the Vice-Chancellor of Bayero University, Kano, Prof. Sagir Abbas. NCC Director of Public Affairs, Dr Ikechukwu Adinde, said this in a statement on Sunday in Abuja. The statement partly read, “The NCC superintends a sector that is knowledge-driven and therefore, it can only achieve its mandate with enhanced collaboration with institutions such as BUK. “In the absence of the citadels of learning, one could only imagine what would have become of the communications industry. “So, if we come to Kano, we need to come to the prime centre of learning in Kano and other universities across the state.” On his part, Abbas said, “The NCC Executive Vice-Chairman Prof Umar Danbatta has served the university diligently, as lecturer, as head of department, as Dean, as director and he was also a former VC in Kano University of Science and Technology, but wherever he goes, you find him relating to his base. “We hold him in very high esteem and we are always happy to see him and his team discharging the national assignment he is saddled with. “Bayero University is proud to be associated with him. We have no doubt that the board and management of NCC will enjoy him more as he begins his second term in office.” (NAN)
