Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State Government has met with traditional, religious and community leaders to tackle rising insecurity in the Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area. This is just as the Commissioner of Police, Mr Johnson Kokumo, conveyed the approval of the deployment of the first batch of 877 of the 2,000 police constabules who had their passing out parade on Saturday to the some communities in the state. He said the men were drawn from the various communities and would work with a joint patrol team, comprising the military, the Department of State Services, and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps. “I have also promised the council chairman that we are going to have the police constabularies here. They were drawn from the various communities. Of course, that is even the basis. “There is a downward trend of crimes and criminality in this community. We are living no stone unturned towards ensuring that we dominate the public space.” The stakeholders also inaugurated the Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Council Vigilante to assist security personnel in fighting crime in the area. The Chairman of the Ikpoba-Okha LGA, Dr Eric Osayande, said the recruited 70 members of the vigilante would assist conventional security agents in fighting crime and paid monthly by the council.
