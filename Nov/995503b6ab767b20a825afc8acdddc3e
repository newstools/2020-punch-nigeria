The Executive Secretary of the Universal Basic Education Commission, Dr Hamid Boboye, stated this in Abuja after monitoring the conduct of the FTS examination, which at the Computer-Based Centres of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board in Kogo and Bwari.

Boboye said although a total of 14,729 candidates had taken the 2020/2021 FTS examination, only 3,700 candidates (100 per state) would be selected because of slim budget. He said, “As far as public schools are concerned, we have problem in terms of the number of teachers that can adequately meet the population of pupils that we have.

He said, “We have been urging the states to ensure that these participants in the FTS are absorbed because UBEC has spent resources in making sure that they are trained as teachers who can contribute to teaching and learning.” Copyright PUNCH.
