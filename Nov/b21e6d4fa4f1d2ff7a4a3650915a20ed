Johnny Edward The 20th National Sports Festival is set to hold from January 3 to 17, The PUNCH has learnt. The Special Adviser on Media to the Minister of Sports and Youth Development, John Joshua-Akanji, confirmed the new date of the NSF to our correspondent. The PUNCH reported two days ago that the NSF had been postponed till next year, as the ministry did not get approval from the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to hold the multi-sports competition. But on Thursday evening, a decision was reached after a virtual meeting between the PTF, The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, that the event should hold in adherence to the COVID-19 protocols. “There is a new date for the National Sports Festival,” Joshua-Akanji told The PUNCH. “The event will hold from January 3-17,” he added.
