Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State Government has said the swearing-in ceremony of Governor Godwin Obaseki for his second term as well as the 2020 Alaghodaro summit, scheduled for November 12, will hold without the usual fanfare. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie, said this in a statement, in Benin, on Wednesday. Osagie said, “Activities slated for the inauguration ceremony of Governor Godwin Obaseki, and his deputy, Rt. Hon. Comr. Philip Shaibu, for a second term in office, scheduled for November 12, 2020, would be without fanfare in respect of the prevailing mood of the country. “The shocks from the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; the fallout of the #EndSARS protests, which was hijacked by hoodlums, leading to the loss of lives of private individuals and security personnel; destruction of property worth millions and the early signs of a second-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, are enough reason not to go on jubilating when there is so much uncertainty ahead. “Hence, we have lined up activities that would be conducted in a manner that reflect the country’s sombre mood for the five-day period.” Copyright PUNCH.
