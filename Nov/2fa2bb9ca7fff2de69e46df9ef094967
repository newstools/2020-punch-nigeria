A former college football coach, Tommy Tuberville, is taking his playbook to Washington, D.C. The 65-year-old Republican challenger and political newcomer won his U.S. Senate race Tuesday in Alabama against Democratic incumbent Doug Jones. Tuberville, who has been out of coaching since 2016, has said he was inspired to enter politics by Donald Trumpâ€™s 2016 election. He guided Auburn to an 85-40 record from 1999-2008, including an undefeated season (13-0) in 2004 when the Tigers were denied a berth in the BCS National Championship Game after finishing third in the BCS rankings. Tuberville also coached at Ole Miss (1995-98), Texas Tech (2010-12), and Cincinnati (2013-16), finishing with an overall record of 159-99 and 13 bowl appearances NAN
