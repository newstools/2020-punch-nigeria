Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The distribution of relief items to flood disaster victims was halted following the attacks of warehouses belonging to the National Emergency Management Agency by hoodlums, the Director-General, NEMA, Muhammadu Muhammed, has said. Muhammad said the hoodlums took advantage of the recent #EndSARS protest to descend on NEMA warehouses, carting away  relief items worth millions of naira. He disclosed this in his speech while presenting highlights of the agency’s roadmap to employees of NEMA in Abuja. In the speech made available to our correspondent by the agency on Thursday, the NEMA boss, however, noted that although the delivery and distribution process was stalled, some state governments got their deliveries before the attacks. “Now that normalcy has been restored, the relief items delivery has resumed in all states that are yet to benefits,” Muhammed stated. He further stated that NEMA had activated its Emergency Operations Centres in 12 states that were faced with the challenge of flooding, as this was to properly coordinate and deploy relevant support for the affected areas. Muhammed told employees of NEMA that the agency must always respond to all catastrophic disasters and would mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors.
