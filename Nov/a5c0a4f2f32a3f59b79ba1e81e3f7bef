Maiharaji Altine, Gusau The Chairman, Zamfara State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress, Alhaji Lawal Liman, has said Senator Kabiru Marafa is not a member of the party. Liman said, “Marafa remained sacked. The party had sacked him since 2019”. Liman stated this while reacting to the comments credited to Marafa, accusing the National Caretaker Committee of the party of injustice. He said, “As far as we are concerned the APC in Zamfara had sacked him, since 2019. “We sacked him in accordance with the party’s constitution and our decision has been forward to the APC National Headquarters, Abuja”. “We are therefore calling on members of the public not to regard him as a member of the APC. “We don’t consider Marafa as our member because he is being used by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party to sabotage the party. “Even by disobeying the party’s National Executive Council’s decision is enough reason to know  that Marafa is not wishing the APC well.” Efforts were made to talk to Marafa on the telephone failed as he was not in the state at the time of filing in this report. All his lines did not connect. Copyright PUNCH.
