Johnson Okafor WorldRemit, a global digital payments company, has announced the launch of its new zero per cent pricing for international transfers to Nigeria. The new lowered price allows customers to send more to family and friends in Nigeria with absolutely no fees and FX margins. According to the digital firm in a statement, the major price drop forms part of a new pricing restructure and represents the largest pricing reduction in terms of the number of corridors for the business. The new zero per cent pricing is in line with WorldRemitâ€™s commitment to supporting remittance flows to Nigeria and helping the diaspora community to supplement and support family and friends back home.
