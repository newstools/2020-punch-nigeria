Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Senator representing Abia Central, Theodore Orji, has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to hold dialogue with the leadership of the Indigenous People of Biafra to avoid further trouble. Orji said this, in an interview with journalists, in Abuja, on Sunday, as part of activities to mark his 70th birthday celebration. The Senator, who was a two-term governor of Abia State, turns 70 today (Monday), said, “If there are dissenting voices, the president should call them and discuss with them. He should find out the cause of their agitation and work out ways to address their grievances. “He should see how he can bring them in and fully integrate them into the system. That is what will solve the problem of the country. Call the dissident voices to a conference. “There is nothing bad in discussing IPOB. If you don’t discuss with them, they will continue to give you trouble. “We can’t be happy when other regions have six states and we have five. It shows that we are marginalised and cheated. That is what is causing the agitation in the region. “Some groups are agitating that the zone should be a country on its own. Others are demanding restructuring because it is glaring that the South-East is being marginalised.” Copyright PUNCH.
