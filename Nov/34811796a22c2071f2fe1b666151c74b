Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Over 20 states and private companies are set to partner the Federal Government to implement the methanol fuel technology in their respective domains, the Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnya Onu, said on Thursday. Methanol fuel is an alternative biofuel for internal combustion and can be used in other engines, either in combination with Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, or independently. Onu, who disclosed this in Abuja at the 18th meeting of the National Council on Science, Technology and Innovation, also said his ministry had developed a strategy of prevention, tracking, testing and treatment for short, medium and long term basis in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The minister said, “The methanol fuel production technology aims at the utilisation of the huge natural gas resources across the country, thereby helping to stop gas flaring as well as creating jobs for Nigeria’s teeming population. “Currently, over 20 private organisations and states have indicated interest in working with the ministry in implementing the methanol fuel technology policy. “The implementation of these policies will help us create jobs and wealth for both the young and old alike.” He noted that the potential of science, technology and innovation in nation building was great, but stressed that the country’s major challenge was poor funding. “Nigeria, our dear country, can develop much faster and overtake many of the developed nations in the near future if greater attention is paid to STI,” he said.
