Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe After battling for her life at a private hospital in Lagos State, for months, one Favour, who suffered spinal cord injury after being raped, has passed away and has been interred. PUNCH Metro had reported how Favour was allegedly raped until she became unconscious by 28-year-old Godday Robinson and dumped in a deep pit in the Agbara area of Ogun State. She was returning from work on April 23, 2020, when Godday allegedly waylaid and raped her for rebuffing his love advances. The suspect allegedly slammed Favour on the edge of the drainage channel and later pushed her into it. Favourâ€™s aunt, Mary Bassey, had told our correspondent that the victim could not talk nor sit as the injury affected her spinal cord. Bassey told our correspondent on Wednesday that Favour died last week Thursday and her remains were buried on Tuesday. Copyright PUNCH.
