Olaide Oyelude, Katsina TWENTY-six kidnapped victims from Katsina State, who were rescued by security operatives, were on Sunday night handed over to Governor Aminu Masari. They were reportedly kidnapped from the Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina State five days ago. The victims, who are mostly females, were rescued from the forest without payment of any ransom and following negotiations facilitated by the Zamfara State Government with repentant bandits. Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State directed their return to Katsina through his Commissioner for Security and Home Affairs, Muhammad Dauran. The victims were said to have undergone medical examination and provided with new clothes before they were brought to Katsina. Dauran informed Governor Aminu Masari at the Government House in Katsina that the victims were kidnapped between Katsina and Zamfara border town. Dauran said, “We are going to intensify negotiation with the bandits for dialogue because we have seen a lot of benefits and achievement in our state regarding security; so, dialogue with bandits is still relevant.” Masari, in his response, pledged the commitment of Katsina and Zamfara states to restoring peace in the two states.
