Kayode Oyero The 2020 edition of The Experience, an all-night gospel concert, will hold strictly online, says the organisers of the programme which has become a favourite annual event for gospel music lovers. Now in its 15th year, the annual event hosted by the Senior Pastor of House On The Rock, Paul Adefarasin, showcases multi-talented and dynamic gospel artistes from different parts of the world. The past 14 editions were held at the Tafawa Balewa Square in Lagos and each gathering averaged an attendance of over 500,000 people, making it arguably the largest gospel concert in the world. But the organisers of the programme announced this week that the event will not hold at the expansive space in the Tafawa Balewa Square, a decision taken to maintain physical distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic. “The Experience 15 (Global Edition), is scheduled to hold on Friday, 11th December, 2020 virtually, livestreamed around the world, serving as a platform to unify the global Church and establish God’s Kingdom here on earth,” the organisers wrote on the event website.

This year’s concert will showcase artistic musical performances, goodwill messages and intercessory prayers by internationally recognised artistes including Don Moen, Tope Alabi, William MCDowell, Tasha Cobbs, amongst others.
