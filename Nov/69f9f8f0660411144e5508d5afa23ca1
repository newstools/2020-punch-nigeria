US authorities have given the Chinese owner of TikTok two more weeks to sell the social media sensation in order to resolve national security concerns voiced by the Trump administration, according to a court filing Friday. A notice filed by TikTok owner ByteDance in federal court showed that authorities had extended the deadline originally set for November 12 to November 27. The Trump administration, which has claimed that the popular video-sharing app could be used for Chinese espionage, has threatened to ban TikTok unless it is sold to American investors. But the ban has been challenged in the courts. (AFP)
