John Alechenu, Abuja Aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress under the aegis of the Concerned APC members have said, the court action initiated by the former National Vice Chairman (South South), Hilliard Eta, was the beginning of a second phase of the party’s crisis. Spokesperson of the group, Abdullahi Dauda said this in an interview with The PUNCH, in Abuja, on Sunday. He said, “For us, this is just the beginning because the party leadership has ignored several appeals to respect agreements but it has failed. Every member of the party has a right to seek justice in court when injustice becomes the mode of operation within the party. “The caretaker committee is an illegal body in the first place, they were not elected; our party constitution only recognizes those elected at a convention as members of the National Working Committee to run the daily affairs of our party. When contacted, the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the party, Yekini Nabena said, “The National Executive Council of the APC is the highest decision-making body of our party after the national convention. So, I don’t know what they are talking about. If any member has any issue regarding decisions taken at that level, the secretariat is open, they can come and get explanations.” Copyright PUNCH.
