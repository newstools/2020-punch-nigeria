A prominent South Korean comedian was found dead at her home in Seoul on Monday alongside her mother, multiple reports said. The bodies of Park Ji-sun, 36, and her mother were found by police, Yonhap news agency reported. Park was reportedly being treated for an unspecified illness and the Seoul Shinmun newspaper cited a police officer as saying there were “no signs of outside intrusion or murder”. Suicide is a chronic social problem in highly competitive South Korea and the leading cause of death for people aged between 10 and 39, according to government data.

Park was a graduate of the elite Korea University, where she studied education, but charmed audiences with her down-to-earth and self-deprecating humor — often light-heartedly playing the role of a woman repeatedly rejected on a date. “I am lucky as a comedian that I can use my face to make people laugh,” she said in an interview with the Hankyoreh newspaper. Several South Korean celebrities have killed themselves in recent years, among them K-pop singers Goo Hara and Sulli, both of whom had been subjected to vicious cyber-bullying, and Kim Jong-hyun of the boyband Shinee.
