Friday Olokor Northern elders, on Saturday, called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), to sack the military chiefs as the insecurity situation in the country continues to deteriorate, while calling for the appointment of young innovative officers. The elders commended the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar, for summoning the courage to speak on the worsening situation, saying the insecurity was largely responsible for the food crisis in the country. The monarch had, during the fourth quarterly meeting of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council in Abuja with the theme ‘Questioning for peace in the challenges of insecurity and COVID-19,’ decried the precarious security situation in the North, saying the region was now the worst place to live. The Coalition of Northern Elders for Peace and Development, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Zana Goni; and its women leader, Mario Bichi, said the Sultan vindicated their consistent alarm on the state of insecurity in the region. The CNEPD said, “We most respectfully commend the Sultan of Sokoto, our father, for stating the true position of things in the North, as it concerns insecurity. We have said the state of insecurity has reached a point where our farmers can hardly access their farms, even as travellers on busy highways can no longer guarantee their safe arrival without being kidnapped.
