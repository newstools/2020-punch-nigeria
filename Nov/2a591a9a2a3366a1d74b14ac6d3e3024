The Chairman, Abia State Council of Traditional Rulers, Eze Joseph Nwabekee and the Royal Fathers had urged the governor to shelve the proposed Abia Airport Project for now and use funds earmarked for it to complete the ongoing road projects in the state including some portions of the dilapidated Aba – Port Harcourt Highway and Aba – Ikot Ekpene Highway which are Federal Government roads. Nwabekee said that fixing the roads would boost the economy of the state. The governor assured them that he would table their request for government to shelve the proposed airport project before the State Executive Council for proper review and a decision.
