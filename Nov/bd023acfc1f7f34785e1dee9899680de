Tony Okafor The Anambra State Government says it is seeking about N150bn to fix roads its roads. The State Commissioner for Works, Marcel Ifejiofor, disclosed this to   journalists at the Government House Conference, Awka, the state capital. He said the state had a lot of interconnected roads that needed to be fixed but had paucity of funds. He said, “Anambra has more network of roads in the South-East and has made adequate arrangements to fix them. “People will freely accuse government of not doing their roads but they do not care to find out the amount of money available to government to do such work. “With N150bn, the state roads will be fixed and that’s about a whole year’s budget or even more. “Most of the roads in the state are suffering because of lack of funds to put them in order.” He attributed the spate of road damage in the state to heavy trucks plying on state roads as well as drainage blockages. Ifejiofor called on residents to ensure that their drainages were frequently cleared. He assured the people of the state that no road project would be abandoned, adding that the present administration would complete ongoing projects in the state before vacating office in 2022.
