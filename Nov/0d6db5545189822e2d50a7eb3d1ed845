Olaleye Aluko The recent EndSARS protests held across the nation could help achieve better governance if political leaders take necessary lessons from the demonstrations. A statement by a leading catering company, 1103 Kitchen, quoted the chief executive officer, Mrs. Olusola Ogunseye, as saying this while reacting on the outcome of the protests. She said although it was unfortunate that some hoodlums later hijacked the protests, the significance of the message sent by the #EndSARS protesters could not be overemphasised. Ogunseye was quoted as saying, “We stand with Nigeria and #EndSARS protesters. Nigeria must be a better country. We believe in police reforms and in better Nigeria.” The CEO said the catering firm distributed free packed foods to the protesters in some areas in Lagos including Ajao Estate to express its support for the good cause the protesters stood for. “We served our fellow Nigerians exercising their constitutional rights with free meals to express our support for a better Nigeria. We can only hope that the outcome of the judicial panels set up in states will lead to a better Nigeria. We also hope the Federal Government will fulfil the demands of the youths,” she added.
