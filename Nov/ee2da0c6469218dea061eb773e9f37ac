Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja Gunmen have assassinated the Olufon of Ifon, Oba Isreal Adeusi, in the Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State. A relative of the monarch confirmed this to The PUNCH on Thursday. Adeusi was said to be on his way from a meeting in Akure in his official car around 4 pm when he was accosted by gunmen and shot. Preliminary reports indicate that no one else was attacked in the car and no item was stolen. His corpse, it was learnt, had been conveyed to the Federal Medical Centre. Speaking with The PUNCH, a relative said, “He was in his official car which had his customised number plate. He drove to Akure for a meeting. But on his way back, on getting to a rough road along Elegbeka, he was accosted by gunmen and shot. “It was clearly an assassination because nothing was stolen from the vehicle and the other two occupants of the vehicle were not harmed.” Adeusi ascended the throne about 23 years ago and was in his 60s
