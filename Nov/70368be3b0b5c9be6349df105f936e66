John Alechenu, Abuja The 90th National Executive Council meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party has commenced in Abuja. In his opening remarks, National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, called for a minute silence for all those who lost their lives due to the poor leadership of the All Progressives Congress-led Federal Government. He said, “We had cause to cry out that the APC government led by President Muhammadu Buhari was doing nothing about the socio-economic situation in the country.“ Secondus explained that the #EndSARS protest championed by Nigerian youths was a direct fallout of not just police brutality but also the mismanagement of our collective wealth by the current regime.
