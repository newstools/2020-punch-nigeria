Dayo Ojerinde A professor of Disciplinary Public Health and Community Medicine, Michael Asuzu, has urged health workers to emulate the late Dr Stella Adadevoh, who was credited for preventing the spread of Ebola Virus Disease in Nigeria in 2014. Asuzu, at a webinar organised by the Foundation for Cultural Heritage, advocated a genuine orientation of medical and health professional education to public and community health. The theme of the webinar was titled, ‘Doing what needs to be done: The only worthy memorial to Dr. Stella Adedavoh.’ He said, “Let us emulate Dr. Stella Adadevoh and our most cultured African values in spirit and truth, like herself; let us clean up our medicine and health professions and practice them with mutual respect and teamwork as due. “Let us, as well trained professionals, take part in the proper leader-citizen-follower repair and advancement of our country. An honest appreciation of the eternal and truly African example that Stella has given for us in every way.” A civil society representative, Chude Achike, said Adadevoh paid the ultimate price for the service of her nation and deserves all the honour. “We are gathered today for a woman, a heroine, our hero, who gave her life for the nation. Through her death, she saved the nation and it is important to honour her,” he said. Adadevoh was the physician at the First Consultant Hospital, Lagos, who discovered Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian infected with Ebola who had entered the country. She prevented him from leaving the facility so as not to spread the virus. Copyright PUNCH.
