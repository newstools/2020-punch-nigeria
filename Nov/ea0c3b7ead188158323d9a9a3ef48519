John Alechenu The Peoples Democratic Party on Saturday described the ruling All Progressives Congress as a party on its way to extinction. The opposition party alleged that there were underground moves by leaders of the APC to disown the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), over his leadership style. The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said these in a statement titled, ‘APC has turned Buhari into a lame duck President – PDP …says APC’s plots to disown Buhari cannot sway Nigerians.’ According to the PDP, with barely three years to the 2023 general elections, the APC has turned Buhari into “a lame duck, given the manifest failure of his administration in all sectors of national life.” The party said, “The frenzy by the APC to commence the 2023 election campaign just a year into President Buhari’s second tenure of four years in office further confirms that APC leaders are now looking beyond its current structure and government, having realised that the next three years under the Buhari-led APC administration would be a waste. “The underground moves by APC leaders to disown the Buhari administration, given its failures and the conversation about possible change of their party’s name as well as the plot to destabilise the PDP are signs of desperation to hold on to power despite APC’s failures and explicit rejection by Nigerians.” When contacted, the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, said, “The PDP has lost it. The allegation of the opposition party against our leaders is a figment of their imagination. We ask them to go and pay the salaries of their workers first before talking to us.” Copyright PUNCH.
