Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri A civil servant, Sulaiman Bazza, is to forfeit his building to the Federal Government for corruptly acquiring it. A judge of the Federal High Court, Damaturu, Justice Hammada Dashen, on Thursday ordered the final forfeiture of the uncompleted building, located on 37 AV Road, off Barracks Road, Jimeta Yola, Adamawa State to the Federal Government. Bazza, a public servant in the Federal Pay Office, Damaturu, was brought before the court by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for acquiring the  building with proceeds of corruption. The case followed a September, 2018 petition by the “Concerned Citizens of Yobe State,” alleging criminal diversion of public funds against the defendant. The Maiduguri Office of the EFCC told the court that in the course of its investigation, it discovered that Bazza took unfair advantage of his position and diverted money belonging to the Federal Government for the purchase of the property. Having earlier secured an interim forfeiture order on the property, the prosecution counsel, Al’Qasim Ja’afar, at the Thursday hearing, urged the court to grant his application for final forfeiture.
