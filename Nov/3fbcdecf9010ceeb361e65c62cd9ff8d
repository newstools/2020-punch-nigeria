Sodiq Oyeleke Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, visited the president, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Thursday inside the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He was received by the President a few hours after his formal declaration for the All Progressives Congress in the presence of the party’s National Caretaker Committee Chairman, governors of Kebbi, Niger, and Jigawa among other top stalwarts. A media aide to the president, Femi Adesina, made the meeting known via his social media handles, attaching pictures. “President Buhari receives Ebonyi State Governor who recently defected to APC in State House on 19th Nov 2020,” he posted. APC National Caretaker Chairman and Yobe governor, Alhaji Mai Buni, and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, were among those at the meeting. Others are Chairman Progressive Governor, Gov Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State; Chief of Staff to the President, Prof Ibrahim Gambari; Governor Mohammed Badaru of Jigawa and former President of the Senate, Sen Ken Nnamani. Umahi had said he joined APC on November 10 when speculations were rife that he was leaving the Peoples Democratic Party. The governor said Ebonyi is presently 99.9 per cent APC as he left the remainder for the national assembly members among other non-defectors. “Do not castigate them because they are looking for something and will come back when they get it. “They are my children and I love them very much as the father of the state,” he said.
