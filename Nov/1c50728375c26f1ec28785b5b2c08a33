The wife of the President, Mrs Aisha Buhari, has commended two groups, the Women Awards Championship International and the Nigeria Aquatic Federation, for its commitment to empowering the Nigerian women, especially the girl-child. Mrs Buhari noted that every effort geared towards making life better for the women should be encouraged because of its reverberating effects on the socio-economic development of any nation. A statement by the organisers quoted Buhari as giving this applause at the Conference Hall of the African First Ladies Peace Mission, Abuja, while unveiling the giant trophy for the maiden International Women Swimming Championship. The event was organised by the groups in collaboration with the African First Ladies Peace Mission. The international sporting programme was held in honour of the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, and the 36 States governors’ wives seeks to rural women and girl-child across the 774 local governments in the country. Mrs Buhari, who was represented by her Senior Special Adviser on African First Ladies Peace Mission, Mairo Al-Makura, said, she remained “committed to breaking the existing social barrier against rural women thereby giving a girl child sense of belonging in line with Sustainable Development Goals as one of the core mission to all women across all strata.”
