Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The Senator representing Ebonyi North Senatorial District, Dr. Sam Egwu, on Sunday, challenged Governor David Umahi, to order for his arrest if he had proof, of his alleged involvement in any plot to use members of the Indigenous People of Biafra and others to breach public peace. Recall that Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi, had in a broadcast on November 27, 2020, alleged that he received information that Egwu alongside other political leaders, were planning to instigate a crisis in Ebonyi State with the aid of cultists and members of IPOB. But Egwu, told journalists, on Saturday, that the governor’s allegation should be properly investigated by security agencies. Egwu said, “They should investigate and arrest me if it is proven that I discussed with anyone or attended a meeting where the issue of instigating violence in the state was discussed. “I am speaking for myself and if it cannot be proven that I discussed or attended such a meeting, they cannot do anything to me.” The former Minister of Education, also said, “The Governor as the Chief Security Officer of the state, should seek the full details of the report from his informant and know what to do subsequently. “I have been a Governor of Ebonyi and wonder why I should connive with people to cause violence in a state I have governed. “I don’t have such character and anyone who has evidence against me on such issues should prove it. Ebonyi State has been and will continue to be a peaceful state as a governor’s defection to another political party should not be a problem.” Copyright PUNCH.
