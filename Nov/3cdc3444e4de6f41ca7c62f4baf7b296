Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe A member of the Lagos State House of Assembly representing Lagos Island Federal Constituency II, Moshood Akiolu, has empowered some teachers in his constituency with Information and Communication Technology tools. Akiolu, who organised a two-day empowerment programme for artisans and teachers in his constituency, gave them various equipment and laptops, noting that the gesture would enhance human capital development on the Lagos Island. The lawmaker, who partnered an ICT firm, SOF Engineering Limited, in the event themed, ‘Leadership and ICT training for teachers’, said teachers were responsible for 80 per cent of community development. He said, “Training of teachers in leadership skills and ICT is very important because we want our teachers to be IT compliant and up to international standards. It’s important for me as part of my constituency projects to make sure that teachers in my constituency are trained in leadership and ICT. “The teachers are given laptops so that they can improve their skills on their own and we are also going to follow up on them because training is a continuous assessment. We have entered a five-year agreement with the ICT firm to continuously train our teachers to be IT compliant.” Copyright PUNCH.
