Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers has said it would not join the strike embarked on by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria over the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System. National Treasurer of NUPENG, Alex Agwanwor, who disclosed this during a programme on 93.7 Rhythm in Port Harcourt monitored by our correspondent expressed the optimism that the issues raised in the memo would be addressed by the Federal Government. Agwanwor who is the Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Labour Congress, Rivers State chapter, said petrol dealers had made adequate import and storage of petroleum products to ensure there was no scarcity of petrol in Port Harcourt and its environs. He called on the Federal Government to urgently address the issues raised by PENGASSAN to avoid a sympathy strike from NUPENG. “We are still consulting at the national level to see the nest step to take as regards the on-going strike by our sister union,” he stated. “However, before this time, we had made proper arrangement in terms of mobilising our members who are the tanker drivers to make sure there is enough availability of petroleum products to cushion the shortage in importation of petroleum products within this period in order to avert any form of scarcity.” He urged members of the public, especially those in Port Harcourt and its environs, not to go into panic buying in anticipation of petrol scarcity, saying tanker drivers had been encouraged to double their distribution channels.
