Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit (Task Force) has given owners of illegal structures around Fagba, Abattoir and new Oko-Oba areas of the state, seven days to remove them. According to the Chairman of the agency, Olayinka Egbeyemi, over 2500 illegal structure owners were served the removal order. Egbeyemi noted that the illegal shanties in the areas were occupied by miscreants and hoodlums who burnt and destroyed public and private properties along the areas during the #EndSARS protest. He said, “It was an eyesore with miscreants and hoodlums freely smoking Indian hemp, including underage boys around the area. “The residents around Fagba, along Abbatoir new Oko-Oba area can no longer sleep with their two eyes closed due to a series of criminal activities perpetrated by these notorious boys.” Egbeyemi said the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, had directed that after the expiration of the ultimatum, miscreants arrested would be charged.
