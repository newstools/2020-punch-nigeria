Kayode Oyero The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye; the Bayelsa State Governor, Duoye Diri; his Deputy Governor, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo; and former Governor Seriake Dickson, gathered in Yenagoa, the state capital, on Sunday, on the occasion of the state’s annual thanksgiving service. The dignitaries were joined by other government officials and respected elder statesmen including former President Goodluck Jonathan, a representative of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, amongst others. Dickson, who made this known via his verified Twitter handle, congratulated his successor and his deputy on their various electoral victories this year. “This is the beauty of the continuity that we fought and worked hard for. This was what God did in his own miraculous way for all of us and it is marvellous in our eyes,” he tweeted. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Diri said he visited 78-year-old Adeboye during his election travails and the cleric had assured him that he would recover his mandate. Diri, who came second in the last year’s governorship election in the state, was declared the elected governor of the state in a subsequent Supreme Court judgment disqualifying the All Progressives Congress’s candidate David Lyon who earlier emerged the winner of the poll. Diri’s victory has been challenged a number of times but the Bayelsa State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja had at different times affirmed him as the duly elected governor of the state.
