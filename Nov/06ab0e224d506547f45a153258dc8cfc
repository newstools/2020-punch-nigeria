Kayode Oyero Former Inspector-General of Police, Tafa Balogun, has appealed to officers and men of the Nigeria Police Force to return to their statutory duties after they were displaced from their stations during the #EndSARS protests. This was contained in a statement from the ex-IGP on Thursday. Balogun was quoted in the statement as saying, “I urge all members of the Nigeria Police in our country to return to their duty posts and continue to provide the much-needed security to our dear country, Nigeria; not minding the recent brutal attacks, arson, and acts of intimidation against the Police. “The Nigeria Police remain the first line of Internal Security as guaranteed by the Nigerian Constitution. Therefore, it behoves all and sundry not to betray the spirit of the Constitution. “I sincerely appeal and urge all my brothers and sisters in the Police Force to put the past behind us as the Federal and State Governments, as well as the police authorities, are positively and aggressively addressing the unprecedented provocative attacks on the police institution. We all love you. “Please, once again, I appeal to all of you to return to duty without further delay.” Rampaging hoodlums, who hijacked the #EndSARS protests against police brutality last month, had attacked cops and burned down scores of police stations in the country. The situation had dispirited police officers across the country who were targetted during the violence.
