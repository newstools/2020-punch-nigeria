Friday Olokor, Abuja Barely two years to the 2023 general elections, a group of northern elders under the aegis of Coalition of Northern Elders for Peace and Development, has joined the clamour for the election of a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction come 2023. According to the group, doing so be in the interest of justice and equity for other geo-political zones to support such a move. This was contained in a statement titled, “Press Statement,” jointly signed by the National Coordinator, Zana Goni, and National Women Leader, Hajia Mario Bichi, in Abuja on Sunday. It read in part, “At a time that our national unity is so threatened, we believe that a detribalised tribe holding the presidency at this time is the surest way of restoring Nigeria’s unity. The Igbos 50 years after the war, have been so marginalised. “To heal that wound and to put that war behind us, we think if the country reaches out to them by supporting them to produce the 2023 Presidency, it will be the masterstroke to heal the wounds. And finally, if that wound is not healed and is made deeper, it can only promote tribal groups.” Copyright PUNCH.
