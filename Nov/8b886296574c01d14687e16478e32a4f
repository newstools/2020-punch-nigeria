Wale Oyewale, Ibadan SEVERAL days after their torture for hours and release from detention at the Odogbo 2Mechanised Division, Ibadan, Mr Adewale Salawu, an Ibadan-based lawyer and Prince Kunle Adelakun, the Jagunmolu Agbekoya of Yorubaland, lamented that they were still receiving treatments as a result of the brutality by the soldiers. Salawu and Adelakun were arrested alongside other persons about two weeks ago following an altercation between a soldier in Operation Burst team and a member of Agbekoya. Hours after being drilled by the military, the duo said although they did not sustain physical injuries, they continued to feel pains all over their bodies. Salawu said, “On getting to the front of the Oyo State Secretariat on Thursday, October 29 for the security meeting, I saw someone being brutalised by soldiers. “When I moved closer, I saw Mr Adelakun being pinned down. I told the leader of Operation Burst that that the man being held was an Agbekoya chief. They pinned me down too.” Adelakun said, “I went straight to the hospital after being released. I was hospitalised for two nights. I was placed on drip and injection. Up till now, I am still recuperating. I am still feeling the impact of the torture at the army barracks.” Copyright PUNCH.
