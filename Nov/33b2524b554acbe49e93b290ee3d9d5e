Tobi Aworinde The Bishop, Catholic Diocese of Abeokuta, Most Rev Peter Odetoyinbo, has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and state governors to ensure the police reforms they promised in response to the #EndSARS protests nationwide are sincere. Odetoyinbo, in a statement titled ‘Bishop Peter Odetoyinbo’s address on the sustainability of reforms in the Nigeria Police Force,’ called on the President and governors to implement lasting solutions to police brutality. The cleric said, “We hope that such will not only end at mere promises whose implementation becomes impossible to fulfil not only by the present administration but subsequent ones. “Let the police reforms be sincere and enduring as this is what can bring an end to the continuous agitations of our people. “Giving life insurance to police officers should not only be mere rhetoric to boost the morale of the officers but justifiably implemented, considering the present situation of the COVID-19 pandemic.” He also condemned the burning of government structures and looting of warehouses and business centres that, according to him, has caused pain and economic hardships to many people. Oyetoyinbo added, “Though the act is criminal in nature, let the government treat them like parents; ready to reform rather than condemn.” Copyright PUNCH.
