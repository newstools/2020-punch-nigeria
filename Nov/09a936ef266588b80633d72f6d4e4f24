Peter Dada, Akure THE Ondo State Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Akure on Tuesday began sitting on a petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party candidate in the last governorship election, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, challenging the outcome of the polls. According to results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission, incumbent governor, and candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Rotimi Akeredolu, polled 292,830 votes, to defeat Jegede, who polled 195,791 votes. In his petition before the tribunal, Jegede is challenging Akeredolu’s victory on four grounds namely: irregularities, pockets of violence, intimidation of voters as well as the APC primary which produced Akeredolu. During the day’s sitting, the tribunal granted the request of the counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Jamiu Makinde, for substituted service to the respondent. The petitioners also sought an order of the tribunal to grant them access to materials used by the INEC to conduct the governorship election held on October 10. Specifically, they asked for electoral materials such as ballot papers and result sheets used in Owo, Ese Odo, Ilaje, Okitipupa local government areas among others. The Chairman of the Tribunal, Justice Umaru Abubakar, granted the order and asked the petitioner to advertise the served processes in newspapers circulating within its jurisdiction. The judge also allowed the petitioner access to election materials in custody of the INEC within the hours of 8am and 4pm for a period of five working days. Copyright PUNCH.
