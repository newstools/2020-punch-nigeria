Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, has thrown its weight behind the Oyo State Governor, Mr. Seyi Makinde-led South West leadership of the party. The decision of the party members in Ondo State, was contained in a statement titled, “Ondo PDP is united and in full support of the leadership of Gov Seyi Makinde,” signed by the State PDP Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kennedy Peretei, in Akure, on Tuesday. He issued the statement after a meeting of party leaders in Akure, the state capital. The party commended Governor Makinde for holding a successful party congress in Ibadan, a few weeks ago. The statement read in part, “We recognise and support Seyi Makinde, Governor of Oyo State as the leader of PDP in the South-West, being the highest political office holder in the zone. “As Chairman of the National Campaign Council for the Ondo 2020 Governorship Elections, Governor Seyi Makinde, did not only make himself available for the election, he stood with us throughout the campaigns and the election. “Ondo State PDP is not made up of ingrates, but a crop of mature and resourceful leaders who can read in between the lines. We do not want to be dragged into the chess pool of over- ambitious persons who wish to create factions in the PDP family with the sole aim of leading such a faction to join the sinking boat of the All Progressives Congress. “The meddlesome interlopers from neighbouring states fanning embers of disunity should stay clear of Ondo state.  They are only feathering their nests. We encourage them to put their house in order.” Copyright PUNCH.
