Adeyinka Adedipe The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, on Friday, ordered contractors of the Niger Delta Development Commission to immediately stop executing projects or undertaking contracts in the state. The governor said the state government was approaching the court to seek an order stopping the Federal Government agency from embarking on any project in the state without the consent of the state’s executive council. Speaking to the management team of Seplat Petroleum Company Limited, who were at the Government House, Benin City on a courtesy visit, Obaseki stated that the NDDC “continues to fail the people of the region” in the discharge of its responsibilities. He said, “We embarked on an ambitious project by signing an agreement with the NDDC and Edo State Oil and Gas Producing Areas Development Commission, to jointly construct the Benin-Abraka Road. Unfortunately, NDDC, as usual, failed and we are going to court. We will not allow it to operate in the state, except subject to our approving every project. “All NDDC contractors in Edo State are stopped forthwith from undertaking any contract or any work in the state. We want to go back and focus on our priorities. We want to build Benin-Abraka Road. We are re-awarding (the contract for) that road.” Earlier, the Chairman of Seplat Petroleum Company Limited, Dr ABC Orjiako, congratulated the governor on his well-deserved victory and subsequent swearing-in.
