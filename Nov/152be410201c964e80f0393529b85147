Kayode Oyero Former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, has said Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, left the Peoples Democratic Party long ago before his official exit this week. Fayose, who is a stakeholder of the PDP in Ekiti State and the South-West region, stated this in a tweet on Wednesday. Controversy continues to trail the defection of Umahi from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress as stakeholders of both parties exchange verbal attacks. Umahi, a longtime member of the PDP, had claimed he defected because of the “injustice” meted to the South-East region by the party, adding that the APC would protect the interest of the region in the 2023 presidential election. But Fayose said Umahi’s decision was unconnected to the interest of the Igbo people. He wrote, “Gov Umahi defected to APC long ago before this unjustifiable move, which clearly has nothing to do with the interest of the Igbo nation. “This is a reflection of the type of leadership our country parades. “Though his action dampens hope for liberation, but I’m sure Nigerians will laugh last because sometimes, it will appear to have gotten so bad before it will begin to get better.”
