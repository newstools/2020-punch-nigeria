Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi No fewer than eight National Youth Service Corps members who are undergoing the three-week orientation exercise at the Wailo camp in the Ganjuwa Local Government Area of Bauchi State have tested positive for COVID-19. This was contained in a statement signed by the Information Officer, Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Ibrahim Sani, and made available to journalists on Friday. According to Sani, as of November 19, the infection rate has risen in some communities in the state. He said, “On the recent reopening of NYSC camps, a surveillance investigation had revealed that out of 600 reported in the camp, eight corps members were reported to have tested positive to COVID-19 in Wailo camp. “To further ensure de-escalation, the Executive Chairman has instructed the surveillance team to carry out sample collection and investigation of all corps members undergoing training in the camp and a holding room has since been allocated by the director, NYSC for those that are suspected/positive cases.” Sani stated that 18 deaths had been recorded out of the 47 confirmed cases of Lassa fever in the state this year, including a three-year-old girl who died of complications “two weeks ago” after she was tested by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. “As we gather this report, three new cases were also reported with two from Toro LGA, while Tafawa Balewa LGA recorded one new case,” he stated. Sani said, “The Executive Chairman has also revealed that, after a detailed active case investigation report, two more people died of suspected yellow fever, putting the number of deaths at 10.
