Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki An Ebonyi State High Court sitting in Abakaliki, on Thursday, restrained the members of the newly sworn-in State Caretaker Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party from parading themselves as members of the state executive committee. This was sequel to an ex-party motion brought by the Onyekachi Nwebonyi-led faction of the state chapter of the party. Recall that the substantive leadership of the state chapter of the party was sacked by the National Working Committee of the party, in Abuja, a week ago. The action followed the defection of Governor David Umahi, to the All Progressive Congress. The PDP NWC subsequently announced and inaugurated a nine-member caretaker committee led by Fred dogu. Nwebonyi and other members of the dissolved SWC sued the PDP and the National Chairman, Uche Secondus, challenging the action of the NWC. Also joined in the suit as respondents are the nine members of the caretaker committee. The plaintiffs represented by their counsel, Roy Umahi, alleged wrongful dissolution of the SWC, claiming that they were not given fair hearing before the purported dissolution. Copyright PUNCH.
