Enyioha Opara, Minna The Niger State Police Command has arrested a 37-year-old man for killing his two children with a cutlass in the Magama Local Government Area of the state. The suspect, Abubakar Maidabo of Maidobo village in Magama, was apprehended by the police operatives attached to the Magama Division on November 14, 2020 while trying to escape. It was learnt that the suspect, after killing his kids, one Umar Abubakar (eight) and Shehu Abubakar (four), hid their corpses in sacks in the bush. City Round gathered that the corpses were recovered by the police and taken to the General Hospital, Nasko for autopsy. The suspect told our correspondent that he could not explain what pushed him to commit the crime. “Honestly, I don’t know what has come over me to kill my own children that God gave to me. I think something is wrong somewhere,” he said. Asked whether he wanted to use them (children) for ritual purposes, Maidabo said, “That will be the last thing I will do. God forbids, in fact I cannot explain how the whole thing happened.” The Police Public Relations 0fficer, Wasiu Abiodun, on Friday confirmed the incident, saying the suspect confessed to the crime. Abiodun said the suspect would be arraigned after investigation. Copyright PUNCH.
