Tony Okafor, Awka No fewer than 46 professors across ethnic divides  are working towards the actualisation of the president of Nigeria of South-East extraction in 2023. The leader of Nigeria Presidential Project 2023, Dr Walter Oji, disclosed this in Awka, the Anambra State capital during the inauguration of  NPP chapter in the state. Oji who said  NPP was a platform with the mandated to facilitate a Nigerian  president of South-East extraction  in the 2023 general elections, said  four former heads of state were in the plan. He called on the youth in the area to shun any action that would trigger unrest in the country. He said, “It is necessary to be reminded that any protest that inhibits the right of movement of others is no longer peaceful. And uncontrolled and seemingly indefinite protests do lead to anarchy and breakdown of law and order. “It is therefore time for reason to prevail in order to channel the gains of peaceful protest to genuine reforms through dialogue. In 1967, we used our muscles and ended in a war indiscreetly; we cannot make that mistake again. “46 professors that cut across ethnic divides, four former heads of state and other prominent Nigerians are working towards the actualisation of the project.” He called on political parties to zone their presidential candidates to the South-East,  stating that failure to do so would attract massive votes against such partys in the area.
