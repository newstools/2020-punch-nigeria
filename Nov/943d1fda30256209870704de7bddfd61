Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has said all transactions in the state are being done in the open hence the administration is not afraid of probe. Fayemi said it was in the bid to ensure openness and transparency that his administration undertook the reform of the Public Procurement Law, which ensured that all transactions were exhibited on Ekiti State website for scrutiny. The governor, represented by the Commissioner for Budget, Femi Ajayi, spoke on Saturday during a three-day Public Procurement Workshop with the theme, ‘Promoting transparency and accountability in public education expenditure through open contracting,’ organised by the Public-Private Development Centre in partnership with MacArthur Foundation. Fayemi, who said Ekiti had keyed into Open Contracting Policy and was complying with fiscal regulation, added, “We know that for government to have a policy that will be workable and transform the economic landscape based on peculiarities, everybody must be involved. “Before 2019, 2020, and 2021 budgets were prepared, we held town hall meetings across the three senatorial districts where every section of the public was represented. That was where people made their demands based on peculiarities. “That was where they told us if it were roads, schools, hospitals, town halls, and others that they needed. Ekiti doesn’t joke with the budget process. No government jokes with budgeting and transform the economy. That was why Governor Fayemi signed to Open Government Partnership. “We are not afraid of probe and financial scrutiny, because we have nothing to hide. That is why the Fayemi administration signed the Freedom of Information Law in 2011. The law is there.” The state Coordinator, Public and Private Development Centre, Mr Nelson Akerele, said the body had helped the government to design a portal where government projects were advertised for transparency and accountability.
