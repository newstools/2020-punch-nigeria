Sodiq Oyeleke Operatives of the Nigeria Police Force on Tuesday surrounded the vicinity of Afrika Shrine, where a meeting on #EndSARS protests was expected to hold today, November 17. The PUNCH gathered that Seun, one of the sons of Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, had earlier sent out flyers announcing a meeting on the lessons from #EndSARS protests. It was learnt that policemen were strategically placed on streets leading to the Afrika Shrine, a popular relaxation spot in the Ikeja area of Lagos State. Some policemen were also seen at the entrance of the venue of the botched meeting. Many activists and #EndSARS campaigners had indicated an interest in attending the meeting before the convener of the meeting, Seun Anikulapo Kuti, said the meeting had been suspended. Seun said in a series of tweets, “Yesterday, the government called my eldest sister, Yeni Anikalpo Kuti, and threatened to close the shrine if I hold my event there tomorrow and also sent a letter to back it up. “I respect my families’ decision not to hold the event as is but I will still go ahead with all the other organisations to launch THE MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLE tomorrow and start our political resistance to the tyranny of this oppressive regime. “This is a meeting, just a meeting of organisations and they are basically banning the right of association. Why are they afraid of the people organising? What is democratic about this act? The last time we tried to launch the government quickly called curfew and this time they have used threat but you can’t stop the will of the people.” Earlier, the Lagos State Police Command warned that the meeting posed a security threat. “You are hereby warned to suspend such gathering as any infraction that may emerge from this gathering will be tagged a deliberate action to sabotage the transition and restoration of the peace in Lagos State by the Lagos State Government and the Nigeria Police Force,” the letter read.
