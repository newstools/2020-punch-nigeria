Umar Muhammed, Lafia No fewer than 62 Director of Personnel Management and Directors of Finance across the 13 local government areas and 18 council development areas of Nasarawa State have been directed to embark on a three-month suspension for allegedly inflating the salary package of local government workers in the state by N600m. The suspension came after a committee set up by Governor Abdullahi Sule indicted the directors. The Public Relations Officer in the Ministry for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr Ibrahim Shigafarta, while confirming the suspension to our correspondent, said the directors failed to comply with government directive to investigate the discrepancies and high wage bills incurred by local governments. He said, “Local government workers’ salaries as of 2012 was N1.1bn. But now that there are no employment, promotions, people died, some retired, while others left for greener pastures, the local government workers’ salaries skyrocketed to N1.3bn monthly. “That was why two months ago, the state government decided to constitute a committee comprising the state Accountant General, Auditor General, Permanent Secretary, three chairmen and a director in the ministry, to look into the problem. “The committee, after investigation, discovered that after payment of salaries and other entitlements, the sum of over  N600m was remaining.” Copyright PUNCH.
