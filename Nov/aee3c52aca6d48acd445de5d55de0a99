Raphael Ede, Enugu The pan-Igbo socio-cultural and political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has declared support for moves by the Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, to dump the Peoples Democratic Party to join the All Progressives Congress. Umahi reportedly told PDP leaders at a meeting, in Abuja, on Tuesday, that he was leaving the party because of its refusal to zone the 2023 presidential ticket to the South East. Deputy National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze, Chief Chuks Ibegbu, described Umahi’s planned move as “legitimate.” Ibegbu said this in a telephone interview with our correspondent, in Enugu, on Wednesday. He said, PDP will be unkind not to zone the 2023 presidency to the South East that has suffered a lot for it.” In a related development, Umahi’s planned move to join the APC is yet to be officially communicated to the party. Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, in response to enquiries by The PUNCH, on the issue on Wednesday, said, “Our doors are wide open to receive all Nigerians who meet the requirements laid down by the constitution to join our party. “For now, there has been no official communication either from him (Umahi) or his people.”  Copyright PUNCH.
