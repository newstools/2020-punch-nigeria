Peter Dada,  Akure The Ondo State Governor,  Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, has said it was financially tasking for the state government to run three universities. The three state government-owned universities include  the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko;  the Olusegun Agagu Universities of Science and Technology, Okitipupa; and the University of Medical Sciences, Ondo town. Akeredolu, who spoke during the visit of the management of the AAUA to his office in Akure, the state capital, on Tuesday said lamented that the state was facing financial challenges. He, however, declared that in spite of the challenges, his administration would continue to sustain and develop the three state owned-universities. The governor said, “Although the burden of running three universities is draining the resources,  our administration will continue to do its best to keep the institutions going in line with the desire of the people. ‘’Running three universities is not a child’s play. We are going through some trying times, particularly financial.” On the accreditation of courses in the universities coming up this month,  Akeredolu said, “We are facing a lot of challenges but the accreditation cannot wait. It is not what we can postpone, we will do our best and see what we can do and make sure that we at least get something for the university to scale through this exercise.” Earlier, in his remarks,  the Acting Vice Chancellor of the AAUA,  Professor Olugbenga Ige, said the governor’s re-election for another term of four years was consequent upon the sound leadership he brought to bear on the people of the state.
