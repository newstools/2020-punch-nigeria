Shops and businesses were shut in several parts of Indian-controlled Kashmir on Saturday as separatists challenging Indian rule called for a general strike to denounce new laws allowing any Indian to buy land in the disputed region. Kashmir’s main separatist group called the strike to protest new land laws that India enacted on Monday, allowing any of its nationals or military directly acquire land in the region, the Associated Press reported. The new legislation ended or modified most laws that governed local land rights. It also abolished 1950s land reform laws that redistributed large patches of land to landless farmers. The move exacerbated concerns of Kashmiris and rights groups who saw the measures as a settler-colonial project to change the region’s demography. They argued that the changes would reduce the region to a colony. Until last year, Indians were not allowed to buy property in the region. But in August 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government annulled Kashmir separate constitution, split it into two federal territories and removed inherited protections on land and jobs. The move triggered widespread anger and economic ruin amid a harsh security clampdown and communications blackout. Since then, India brought in a slew of changes through new laws, to the resentment and anger of the region’s people, many of whom want independence from India or unification with Pakistan.
