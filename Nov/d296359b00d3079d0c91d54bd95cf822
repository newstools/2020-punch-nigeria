MOBOLA SADIQ The Ibidunni Ighodalo Foundation, through Project 40at40, has selected 40 couples to be recipients of In-Vitro Fertilisation in accordance with the wishes of the late founder, Ibidunni. The Chairman of the foundation, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo, who unveiled the awardees at a press conference on Friday, revealed that over 1,500 applications were received. Ighodalo explained that Project 40at40, which was launched on July 19, 2020, was targeted at easing the financial burden of parents in need of assisted reproduction, IVF and other fertility treatments. He said, “This is what prompted Ibidunni to set up this foundation – the large number of people going through fertility-related challenges, and the fact that treatments are usually in the millions, which many cannot afford.’’ The Executive Director of the foundation, Ms Adedayo Richards, acknowledged the patience of the awardees through the selection process.
