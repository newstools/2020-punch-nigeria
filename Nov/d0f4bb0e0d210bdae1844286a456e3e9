Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa BAYELSA State Governor, Douye Diri, has announced the renaming of the Ijaw National Academy, Kaiama, after the late Captain Samuel Owonaro (retd), who was the second-in-command to the icon of Ijaw struggle, late Major Isaac Boro (retd). Speaking at the weekend during the funeral of Owonaro in Kaiama, headquarters of Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area, Diri said the gesture was aimed at immortalising the departed Ijaw hero. He described the deceased as one “who led an impactful life and left the legacy of a role model to the younger generation.” He stressed that Owonaro over the years had affected the lives of not only the people of Kolokuma but the entire Ijaw nation and Nigeria as well. The governor, while pouring encomiums on the freedom fighter, said, “As a young man, part of how the imprint of late Isaac Adaka Boro impacted on me and very many of us in the old Rivers State is the Adaka Boro Park named after our Ijaw hero. “And so, today, may I also pronounce that the Ijaw National Academy henceforth be named as Captain Sam Owonaro Academy. In the same vein, I hereby direct the Commissioner for Works and other relevant commissioners to look out for a street worthy to be named after Nottingham Dick, one of the three heroes.” In his remarks, a former president of the Ijaw National Congress (INC), Joshua Fumudoh, said the Ijaws would forever remember Owonaro who was the ‘Last-Man-Standing’ that kept the memories of other freedom fighters alive before his death.
