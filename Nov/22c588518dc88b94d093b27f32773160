Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company Plc said on Wednesday that it would commence the rollout of free meters to customers under the Federal Government’s National Mass Metering Programme in a bid to bridge the nation’s metering gap.

It read that in the first phase of the programme, running till the end of December, more than 100,000 prepaid meters would be rolled out to customers who are duly registered, passed the technical evaluation and paid under the Meter Asset Provider Scheme. It stated that the primary objectives of the National Mass Metering Program are to increase the metering rate in Nigeria, curb losses and increase financial flows to the industry at large. The statement read in parts, ‘’Part of the objectives also includes the elimination of estimated billing, improving network monitoring capability and strengthening the local content in meter manufacturing in Nigeria. “The National Mass Metering Program is expected to roll out six million meters over the next 18 to 36 months across Nigeria.
