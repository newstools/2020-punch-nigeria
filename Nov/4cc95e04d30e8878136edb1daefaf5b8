Kayode Oyero A Presidential candidate of the Young Progressives Party in the 2019 elections, Kingsley Moghalu, on Monday, warned the Federal Government to ‘reverse gear’ on actions taken against #EndSARS promoters in the country. According to the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Nigeria ‘risk igniting even more resistance’ by the recent clampdown of the government on #EndSARS campaigners. @MoghaluKingsley tweeted, “The clampdown on #EndSARS protesters and supporters is completely wrong and unacceptable. “I urge the authorities to “reverse gear”. These actions raise questions about the good faith of the government, and risk igniting even more resistance. Not wise!” The PUNCH had reported that the Central Bank of Nigeria froze the accounts of 20 #EndSARS champions while another promoter of the movement, Modupe Odele, was prevented from travelling last week and had her passport seized by the Nigeria Immigration Service. Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had also said the #EndSARS promoters must face the law for allowing the nationwide protests to degenerate into the destruction of lives and properties.
