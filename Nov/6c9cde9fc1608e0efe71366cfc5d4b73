Leke Baiyewu The House of Representatives has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), to issue an executive order allowing the use of part of the revenue generated by the Nigeria Customs Service for repairs on the access roads linking the seaports in Lagos. This, the House said, would enhance revenue generation by the NSC. The Chairman of the House Technical Committee on Customs and Excise, Leke Abejide, made the call when he led members of the committee on an oversight visit to Customs formations in Lagos State. Abejide said Nigeria was losing much of its revenue to the lack of access roads to the ports. He stated that, if the roads were constructed, the nation would have no reason to take foreign loans to finance its annual budgets. The lawmaker said, “How much will these roads cost to construct? I am not sure the roads will cost more than N100m to construct. Even if the amount is more than that, we can dedicate three months’ revenue to construct these roads once and for all, since doing that will enhance our revenue generation.” Addressing members of the committee when they visited the headquarters of Zone A of the Customs Service, the Assistant Comptroller General of Customs, Kathleen Ekekezie, said officers and men of the service were ready to work for the interest of the country and generate more revenue.
