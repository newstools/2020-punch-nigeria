Joseph Olaoluwa Aviation ground handling companies in the country have reported dwindling revenues for the first nine months of the year. The ground handling firms, Skyway Aviation Handling Company Plc and the Nigerian Aviation Handling Company Plc, saw their combined revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30 dip by N2.7bn to N10bn from N12.7bn in the same period of 2019. This represents a 21.2 per cent reduction in revenue in the period under review, according to the financial statements of the companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The firms’ performance portrays an industry fraught with job losses, revenue declines and closure of the nation’s airports due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was most recently affected by protesters who blocked the entrances of the Lagos airport in a bid to express their grievances against police brutality and extortion in the country. Checks by our correspondent showed that NAHCO’s revenue for the first nine months of the year dwindled by 29.8 per cent to N5.1bn, compared to the N7.3bn recorded in the same period of 2019. It recorded a loss before tax of N76m for the nine months of 2020 as against a profit before tax of N973m in the corresponding period of 2019. NAHCO recorded a loss after tax of N65m for the nine months of 2020, as against a profit after tax of N782m in the corresponding period of 2019. Further checks into its revenue segment showed that it recorded less income for passenger/aircraft handling for the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Its passenger/aircraft handling for the nine months of 2020 was N1.7bn compared to the N4.0bn recorded for the same period of 2019, representing a revenue reduction of 60 per cent. However, leasing experienced an uptick with N222.9m recorded in the nine months of 2020, as against N197.6m recorded in the similar period of 2019. Similarly, SAHCO recorded a revenue decline of N4.9bn for the first nine months of 2020, as against N5.4bn recorded in the first nine months of 2019, representing a decline of nine per cent. Profit before tax stood at N549m, compared to the N599m recorded in the nine months of 2019. The company recorded N318.8m profit after tax for the first nine months of 2020, compared to N341.8m in the corresponding period of 2019, representing a decline of 6.7 per cent. Revenue from foreign handling was down N605.6m compared to the N950m recorded for the same period of 2019. Revenue from domestic handling was down N278.9m compared to the N447.7m recorded for the same period of 2019. Both ground handling firms profits dwindled significantly in the first six months of the year. Recently, NAHCO signed a contract that would enable it provide passenger, cargo and ground handling services to Qatar Airways for five years. Copyright PUNCH.
