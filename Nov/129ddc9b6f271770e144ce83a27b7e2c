Joseph Olaoluwa The Nigerian Shippers’ Council on Friday said that the Council has set machineries in motion to put an end to the perennial Apapa gridlock before the end of first quarter of 2021. The Executive Secretary of the Council, Hassan Bello, said this on Friday when he played host to the National Advisory Committee set up by the presidency on African Continental Free Trade Area at the council’s head office in Lagos. He added that the gridlock and other issues in the ports and along the corridors being tackled would ensure the country utilised the benefits in the AfCFTA. He said, “We have a deficit on infrastructure, issues in rail, road, connectivity between our ports and the hinterland and elsewhere in Africa. “I am an optimistic person and that is why I want to say that by March, first quarter of 2021, the gridlock in Apapa will disappear. “This is because we are approaching it in a scientific angle, first we have to make the ports digital  and contactless, no need to go to the port to make payment or other transaction, all these will be online,’’ he said. Bello promised the Nigerian Ports Authority would deploy electronic call-up system to manage traffic, customs on e-customs, provisions of scanners. Copyright PUNCH.
