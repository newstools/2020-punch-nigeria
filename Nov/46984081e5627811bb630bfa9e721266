Kelvin Ekerete Super Eagles defender, Leon Balogun, says the team are upset and determined to go to Freetown to pick up the maximum points following their surprising 4-4 draw against Sierra Leone in the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin, Edo state on Friday. The Eagles were coasting towards a third win from three in Group L after racing to a 4-0 lead inside the first 30 minutes of the game but saw the Leone Stars fight back to pick up a valuable point away from home. The Leone Stars have not lost at home in any competition in the last seven years and Balogun while speaking after the team’s training session on Saturday told The PUNCH that the team were determined and are ready to end the Leone Stars unbeaten run at home. He said, “I am not the kind of guy that loves to battle on the social media, newspaper or wherever because my job is to battle on the pitch and we are surely going to challenge that record that they hold there. “The goal is to break that unbeaten record obviously. We have something to make up for last night and our job is to make that happen no matter what. “The team is very determined to makeup and the only thing I want to say is that Nigerians should not give up on the team because mistakes are human.” The Glasgow Rangers player also allayed any fear that he had picked up an injury after he was substituted by coach Gernot Rohr. He continued, “I am fine. I picked up a knock during the game but there was nothing that could have made me struggle throughout the game. I actually don’t have any problem.”
