Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The representative of Zamfara Central in the Senate from 2007 to 2019, Senator Kabiru Marafa, has warned the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress not to destroy the party with his utterances. Buni had at the end of his Committee meeting on Tuesday, claimed that the crises in the Bauchi, Bayelsa, Cross River, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Zamfara, Ondo and Oyo State chapters of the party, had been resolved. But Marafa in a statement on Thursday, titled, ‘Buni’s committee lied, Zamfara APC crisis not resolved – Sen Marafa,’ in Abuja, said the claims of the Yobe State Governor was not correct. The governorship aspirant of the party in the 2019 election, who said the committee had not done anything since its inception to resolve the crisis in its Zamfara State chapter, called for its immediate sacking. The Senator insisted that the two factions of the party in Zamfara State were still existing and operating parallel secretariat in Gusau, the state capital, and across the 14 local government areas of the state. Marafa said, “This ungodly claim by the committee would only worsen the crisis of the party in the state.” He reiterated the commitment of his camp to fight for its rights and the rights of average Zamfara APC members. He said, “With this statement, the committee has deflated the trust and confidence reposed in it, by misleading the public with the claim that it has resolved the crises in the states mentioned. “The committee has lost its integrity and its members should therefore resign or be sacked. “This is nothing but a wicked lie. I pray that the committee is not on a mission to destroy the party completely. “They have not done anything and have not contacted anybody; either by phone or letter, formally or informally. “They are behaving as if Zamfara State does not exist and therefore doesn’t matter,” he stated.
