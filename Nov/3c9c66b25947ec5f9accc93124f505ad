Friday Olokor, Abuja The senator representing Borno South in the National Assembly, Ali Ndume, on Saturday said former President Goodluck Jonathan left behind great value and landmark in Nigeria which shaped the political landscape of the country. According to him, other people who were skeptical about Jonathan’s behaviours have realised how great he is, adding that many Nigerians don’t value what they have until they lost it. Ndume stated these at Apo Legislative Quarters In Abuja, during the opening of Dr PhysiQ Specialist Centre for Wellness and Medical Lifestyle Change and the public presentation of a book titled, ‘Everything Heals’, written by Dr Susana Adams, the centre’s chief executive officer. While describing his recent detention at Kuje Correctional Centre and subsequent release from custody as the will of God, Ndume said, “God wants it, that I must be here, because I was just released from detention yesterday night (Friday), otherwise, I would have been in Kuje Prison up till now.” Ndume, speaking about Jonathan, said, “For this country, I think Nigerians know that they don’t value what they have until they lose that thing. “You don’t know how great you are in the eyes of those that were skeptical, those that don’t know you (Jonathan), those that didn’t come close to you. But now, honestly, I am one of those that used to criticise you very well, but I will say it was constructive move.” Jonathan, who later inspected the new wellness centre, was accompanied by a former of Minister of Information, Labaran Maku; a veteran broadcaster, Eugenia Abu, among others.
