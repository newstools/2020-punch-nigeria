Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The requests for COVID-19 data are currently overwhelming Nigeria’s statistical system as well as others on the African continent, the National Bureau of Statistics declared on Wednesday. In his keynote address at the African Statistics Day 2020 in Abuja, the Statistician-General, NBS, Yemi Kale, stated that based on the increased requests for data and statistical services, it was vital to modernise statistical agencies. The NBS boss said, “The desire to reorganise and modernise our national statistical agencies across Africa is timely and even more pressing, particularly in the wake of the recent COVlD-19 pandemic. “The implication of this has meant that national statistical systems across the globe, including Africa, have been overwhelmed by requests for data, statistical services and information.” He said the requests were from governments, citizens and development partners for the purpose of planning and targeting interventions during the COVID-19 period. Kale said, “In addition to this, we also have to find better and safer ways of working while the pandemic is still with us. “This new reality requires the need to modernise statistics development and data collection by using new technologies and new data sources to maximise efficiency to provide data and statistics necessary to support sustainable development and peaceful coexistence in Africa.” He noted that governance and security statistics were fundamental to ensuring that the relationship between the state and its people was inclusive, transparent, and accountable.
