Osagie said, “The governor acknowledges the role of youths in the actualisation of his second term bid. Youths make up more than half of the state’s population. So, it is only right that they determine what works best for them in government. “The 2020 Youth Summit will enable the state government to assess the impact of the administration’s policies and programmes on job creation, youth empowerment, basic and technical education and youth participation in governance, among others.” Copyright PUNCH.
