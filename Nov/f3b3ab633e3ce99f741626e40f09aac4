Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Tuesday said the Federal Government was making an economic error by its continued closure of Nigeria’s land borders. President, ACCI, Adetokunbo Kayode, said this at a press briefing in Abuja ahead of the forthcoming Abuja International Trade Fair. The chamber urged the Federal Government to open up the country’s borders, stressing that it was a matter of urgency considering the impact it would have on the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement. Kayode argued that the Federal Government did not consult the people in Nigeria’s business community extensively, stressing that private sector operators would have made gainful inputs. “The Federal Government should open up the borders because we have signed the AfCFTA agreement and closing the borders would not mean well considering the agreement,” he said. The ACCI president further noted that Nigeria’s economy must be diversified to avoid crashing into more economic recessions in the future. Copyright PUNCH.
