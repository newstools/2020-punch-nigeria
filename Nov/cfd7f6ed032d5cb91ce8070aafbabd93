Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe At least one person has been killed after some armed robbers attacked a bullion van on Ado Road in the Ajah area of Lagos State. PUNCH Metro gathered that the robbers attacked the van around 3pm on Thursday and carted away huge sums of money. Our correspondent learnt that the gunmen first fired at the van from a distance, but the driver refused to stop till he got to Blenco Supermarket. A clip of the robbery circulated on the social media revealed the robbers pumping bullets into the van to open the lock. Other videos taken after the robbery showed a suspected casualty of the attack on the floor. On Twitter, some witnesses and residents shared their experiences. A witness @Simisoula, claimed that the robbers escaped with money. She tweeted, “Armed robbers just robbed Blenco’s ATM bullion van (Ado Road, Ajah) just now. Raining bullet with Blenco police. They made away with the money and scattered the rest on the road. People are picking money right now on the road. Pls stay indoors if you are in that axis.” A resident @MerrymaryTom, said a security guard was injured and rushed to a hospital in the neigbourhood. Another eyewitness @vlQtoOoR, said, “From what I saw, these guys were in a milk coloured vehicle, pursuing a bullion van. They shot the tyres, but the van escaped then they hovered around Blenco area before entering the premises. I watched this from the seaside just opposite Blenco.” The state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, said he had yet to be fully briefed, adding that he could not comment. Copyright PUNCH.
