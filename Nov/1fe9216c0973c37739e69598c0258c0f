BARELY a month after lighting up the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City, the 55MW CCETC-Ossiomo Independent Power Plant has commenced provision of 24-hour power supply to the Edo State Secretariat and the new wing of the State High Court, on Sapele Road, Benin City. In a statement, the Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie, said the lighting up of the public assets was part of the overall strategy of the state government to provide stable electricity to run government so as to  ensure efficiency and drive productivity. According to him, public assets that have been connected to Ossiomo IPP include the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, the Edo State Secretariat Complex and the new wing of the State High Court, while those that are to follow are the new wing of the Government House, Stella Obasanjo Hospital and other state-run hospitals, among others. He noted that aside the public buildings, a number of private individuals had also plugged into the power plant and were enjoying 24-hour electricity that was priced below the current rate of competitors in the market. “A key feature of having the CCETC-Ossiomo IPP in Edo State is to drive industrialisation. So, we encourage businesses to come in and set up shops in the state and tap the benefit of running their factories for 24 hours, so they can boost productivity and reduce downtimes caused by erratic power supply.
