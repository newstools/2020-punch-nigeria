Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts, on Thursday, grilled officials of the Federal Government over how a $125m loan obtained from the World Bank was spent. The committee summoned signatories to the World Bank account belonging to the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation where the money was domiciled and through which it was allocated to various government bodies. The Director-General, Budget Office of the Federation, Ben Akabueze, who also appeared before the panel for the second time in two weeks, stated that the money was captured in the 2018 Appropriation Act, stressing that the Accountant General of the Federation was also aware of the loan. Akabueze was particularly grilled over the $36.1m allocated to the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation, which had earlier complained to the committee that paucity of fund was crippling its activities. The BOF boss told the lawmakers that $200,000 out of the sum had already been disbursed to the auditor general office. He also presented a document to the committee, which showed a list of beneficiaries of the $125m loan, including the auditor-general. Chairman of the committee, Mr Oluwole Oke, summoned all collaborating Ministries, Departments and Agencies to appear before the lawmakers next week. Earlier, the Director of Fund, Office of the Accountant General, Sabo Mohammed, said the office had no documents except the committeeâ€™s letter requesting details of the $36.1m dollars world Bank loan given to the auditor general office. Mohammed, therefore, urged the lawmakers to give more time to enable the office make available the required documents.
