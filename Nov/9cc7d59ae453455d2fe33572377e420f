A statement from Rivers State Government house signed by the Special Assistant to Wike on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, quoted the governor as saying, “The advice I have for the couple, is that they must consistently be each other’s friend. And, they must ensure that their business is their business, and be prayerful and committed to God in all their endeavours.” On his part, Malami described the wedding as historic, saying, “This is a historic marriage. Historic in the sense that it is a marriage that has created a bridge, bringing people from the South, people from the North, East and West to come together to identify with the Governor of Sokoto State, who is the father of the groom and to share in the joy Senator Tafida who is the father of the bride.” Similarly, Secondus said, “Tambuwal is a bridge builder and you can see that people across the country have assembled here to honour him. Our prayer is that God will bless the couple. We believe that God will grant them the fruit of the womb.”
