John Alechenu, Abuja Secretary of the All Progressives Congress Caretaker /Extra Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee, Senator James AkpanUdoedehe, has said the upcoming membership registration exercise was part of the party’s effort to rebuild and rebrand itself for the future. He said this while speaking to journalists, in Abuja, on Wednesday. The party secretary urged supporters across the length and breadth of the nation, to ensure that they were carried along in the rebuilding process. Akpanudoedehe also said it was particularly important for politicians in the South Woodpile, especially in Akwa Ibom State, to join hands with the party leadership to entrench  the party in the zone before the 2023 general elections.

Let’s build the party before we talk of 2023.” The party scribe explained that so much damage was done to the internal mechanisms of the party hence the need to rebuild the party from bottom up. According to him, it was after the party took its pride of place in the zone that members who had ambitions to contest for elective office can do so on its platform.  Copyright PUNCH.
