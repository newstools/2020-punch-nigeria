Sunday Aborisade, Abuja An aide to the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Muhammad Bello, has denied allegations that he was delaying the appointment of the seven secretaries expected to run the FCT administration with him. Special Adviser (Media), to the Minister of State, FCT, Mr Austine Elemue, said this while speaking to newsmen in Abuja, on Monday. The FCT secretaries are like state commissioners responsible for the coordination of affairs in areas of Education, Health and Agriculture, among others. There have been allegations by the stakeholders that the Minister refused to inaugurate the secretaries for the seven mandate areas of administration. Buhari, had in February, reportedly approved appointments of the secretaries based on a request by the FCT minister. Elemue said, “Once the nominations come, they will now send it to security agencies for background checks. “It is after this that they will now take it back for the final approval by the President. “I don’t know whether it (the list) is still on Mr President’s desk, because I don’t think a minister of the FCT will singlehandedly withhold the inauguration of mandate secretaries if the approval has been given. That office (FCT Minister),  you are seeing is a delegated responsibility of Mr President.” Copyright PUNCH.
