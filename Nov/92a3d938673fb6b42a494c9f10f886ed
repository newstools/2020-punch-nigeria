Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa A former deputy governor of Bayelsa State, Mr Peremobowei Ebebi, has vowed to challenge Tuesday’s judgment of the Federal High Court, Yenagoa, which disqualified him as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress for the Bayelsa West senatorial bye-election. Justice Jane Inyang had delivered the two judgments on two-related cases of alleged forgery filed against Ebebi by Mr Richman Samuel, a former director of Domestic Matters, Government House, Yenagoa, and some registered members of the APC from the senatorial district. But Ebebi, in his reaction to the ruling on Thursday, said he had instructed his team of lawyers to appeal the judgments. He contended that the court did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the matters. Ebebi said, “We have instructed our legal team to appeal the two judgments delivered by the court without jurisdiction. “It should be noted that this is not the first time this particular judge has given these kinds of judgments to destabilise the APC. These judgments were not unexpected as the judge demonstrated bias ab initio.” Copyright PUNCH.
