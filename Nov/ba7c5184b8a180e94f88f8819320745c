Dayo Ojerinde THE lawmaker representing the Ikeja 1 Constituency in the Lagos State House of Assembly, Folajimi Mohammed, has urged his constituents to explore the new Information and Communication Technology potential to bounce back from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mohammed, who spoke at a constituency stakeholders’ meeting on Thursday, urged Lagosians to continue to obey COVID-19 guidelines. The event had as its theme, ‘Post COVID-19 pandemic: The challenges and prospects’. He said, “The virus has not only spread across the world, but has ravaged virtually every facet of the socio-economic and political life of nations. Normal life has become a mirage, prompting many businesses to close or collapse with attendant loss of jobs and food shortage. “While the government is taking steps to bring life back to normal, we urge every citizen to obey all regulations guiding the containment of COVID-19 in the state in order to free our society of the pandemic, which is limiting opportunities in many areas. “This, in tackling the socio-economic challenges posed by the pandemic, individuals are encouraged to look into the effective management of the various post-pandemic opportunities such as business creation by exploring e-commerce, adapting to the new ICT potential, acquiring relevant skills or education, while government must also invest more in e-governance to facilitate a more efficient and robust governance.”  Copyright PUNCH.
