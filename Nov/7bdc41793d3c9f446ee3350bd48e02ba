Hindi Livinus, Yola Suspected kidnappers have abducted the wife and son of a security detail of former vice president Atiku Abubakar. The aide, a police officer, was reported to be the primary target of the attack. However, when the gunmen did not find him, they took his wife and son. Sources said on Wednesday that the incident took place on Monday in Yolde-Pate community, Yola, Adamawa State, when the officer was believed to be around after coming into town with Atiku for the weekend. “The kidnappers believed that the officer, being close to Atiku, would have money, so they went for him; they took his wife and son when they did not find him,” a source said. Our correspondent also learnt that an elder brother of the state Majority Leader, Hammantukur Yettisuri, was abducted about the same time in the Jada Mbulo area of the state. The sources said the gunmen got to the community around 2am and shot into air before breaking into the house of the lawmaker’s brother. “They got away with the man, shouting that they would not return him unless the family paid N50m,” a source said. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, confirmed the two abductions, but did not give the names of the victims. He said the police would do everything to free them and bring the gunmen to book. Copyright PUNCH.
