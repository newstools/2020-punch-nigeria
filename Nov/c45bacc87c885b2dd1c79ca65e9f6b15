Friday Olokor, Abuja A former governor of Imo State, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, has said his empowerment scheme targeted at the less privileged had nothing to do with the 2023 presidency. Okorocha, representing Imo West Senatorial District in the National Assembly, said this, in Karmajiji, one of the slums in Abuja, during the inauguration of a multimillion Rochas Care Outreach and Skill Acquisition Centre, an agency of the Rochas Okorocha Foundation, on Saturday. The event also witnessed the graduation of 45 participants trained in information and communication technology, tailoring and other vocational skills by the RCOSAC. The ceremony also witnessed the presentation of certificates, empowerment items such as tailoring machines, grinding engines among others to graduates. Okorocha said, “So, it has nothing to do with politics. If politics is about helping the poor, then let everybody play it, because it will help us. It’s nothing about 2023. These people here might likely not vote. “It has nothing to do with politics. Rochas Foundation has been in existence before any presidential aspiration or whatever. We have been here for more than 25 years and we have raised about 22,000 children. “This (Rochas Care) is an arm of the Rochas Foundation. It is a reach-out and touch programme to rural areas, to uplift the lives of the poor people such as the Karmajiji youths you are seeing here.” Copyright PUNCH.
