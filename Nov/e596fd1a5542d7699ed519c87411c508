Sunday Aborisade, Abuja A former deputy president of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, has advocated a reform of the Nigerian laws to properly address challenges encountered during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future challenges. The lawmaker, according to a statement by his media aide, Uche Anichukwu, on Wednesday, spoke in Enugu. The statement explained that Ekweremadu delivered a lead paper entitled “Law and National Development Under Covid-19 Era: Charting a Legislative Response to Disruptions of the Legal Order” at a Virtual Conference organised by the Faculty of Law, University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus. He said, “We never projected that a day would come when the parliament, courts, government offices, and indeed the country and the world would shut down for weeks or months, not by war, not by unrest, but by a plague of Covid-19 proportions. But it has happened and the threats are still with us. “It, therefore, means we have to think outside the box, taking measured steps to reform our laws and possibly create new ones where necessary to cater to both the present and future realities in order to ensure smoothness, effectiveness, efficiency, and equally confer legitimacy on governance. “While virtual conduct of legislative business might be permissible, the safest route would be an amendment of the Constitution to expressly authorise virtual plenaries, committee meetings, public hearings, among others.”
