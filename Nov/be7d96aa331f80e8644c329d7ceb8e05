It said this in a statement on Monday entitled ‘Leadway Pensure delivers strong results in October 2020’. Leadway Pensure stated that in the month under review, its “annualised return for RSA Fund I was 32 per cent against a 25 per cent benchmark”. “RSA Fund II returned 25 per cent against a 23 per cent benchmark; RSA Fund III returned 20 per cent against a 15 per cent benchmark, and RSA Fund IV returned 18 per cent against a nine per cent benchmark, culminating in an overall high performance of RSA funds across multiple investments in the company.” The annualised return represent the approximate return achievable by an investment if retained for a whole year as opposed to when it is prematurely terminated, according to the statement. Commenting on the results, the Managing Director, Leadway Pensure PFA, Mrs Aderonke Adedeji, stated that the performance was a testament to the company’s consistent efforts to deliver excellent results to its customers and remain one of the leading PFAs in the country. She said, “As a company, we work assiduously to never stray from our objective of remaining among the top-five Pension Fund Administrators in the nation. “Being intensely aware of the dynamic nature of the market, we consciously guard our RSA funds against downturns to preserve value. Thus, causing our funds to outperform a 14.23 per cent inflation rate in October.” She said the company remained confident that the rest of the year would not be any different.
