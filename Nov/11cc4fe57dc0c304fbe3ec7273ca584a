John Charles, Makurdi There are indications that the strange illness ravaging Okpeilo-Otukpa in Ogbadibo Local Government Area of Benue State may have started since October 2020. The State Epidemiologist, Dr Ngishe Terungwa, disclosed this to our correspondent on the telephone on Wednesday. The epidemiologist said they had yet to get the cause or causes of the strange illness, stating that samples collected were taken to Abuja for examination. Terungwa, who said he could not give the exact figure of those hospitalised, explained that the state government had sent a team to the community to conduct an active case search. He said, “With the information we gathered, it started in October but the people could not say exactly the date but is in well from Independence day.”
