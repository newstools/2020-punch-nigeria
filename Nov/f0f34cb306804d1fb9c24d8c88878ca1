Adeniyi Olugbemi, Sokoto The Sokoto State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party and its All Progressives Congress counterpart on Monday engaged in a war of words over the citing of a housing project in Wamakko. The ruling PDP, had in a press statement by its state publicity secretary, Abdullahi Hausawa, berated the APC for finding fault in the decision of the state governor, Aminu Tambuwal to construct 342 housing units in Wamakko. Wamakko is the home town of a former governor of the state, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda, who is a leading member of the APC.

The PDP in response, said, “the claim by the APC chairman, that none of Governor’s Tambuwal projects has ever been completed including the secondary school in Balle was laughable, because it shows that the chairman is yet to regain his senses after being inflicted with 342 dementia.” Copyright PUNCH.
