Samson Folarin The Lagos State Government has started training 2,000 tradesmen and artisans in the state as part of efforts to upgrade their skills to meet job demands of a 21st century economy. The state Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment, Mrs Yetunde Arobieke, stated this during the flag-off of the 2020 up-skilling and retraining programme. Arobieke said the scheme was a demonstration of government’s commitment to enhancing the competence and quality of artisans and traders in the state. “It gives me a deep sense of satisfaction to note that we are committed to ensuring that the micro, small and medium enterprise sector of our state’s economy, to which most of you belong, grows and flourishes,” she added. She urged the beneficiaries of the training to reciprocate the gesture of the government by contributing their quotas towards the attainment of a greater Lagos. The commissioner noted that the training was designed to address issues of skill mismatch and provide the right mix of skill sets needed to service the industrial needs of the state and the country.
