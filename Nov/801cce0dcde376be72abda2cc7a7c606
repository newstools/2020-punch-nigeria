Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State Government has publicly shamed the seventh convicted sex offender under its name and shame initiative. The sex offender, whose details were pasted in public places and included in the sex offenders’ register, is a 51-year-old man, Ajayi Peter. Peter was sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court of Ado Ekiti for the rape of a 12-year-old girl. The convict, a native of Itapa Ekiti in the Oye council area, was resident at Ijero Ekiti in the Ijero Local Government Area of the state. Before him, six others had been publicly shamed at different times since 2019 when the initiative began under the Governor Kayode Fayemi-led administration. The Ekiti State Attorney General, Mr Olawale Fapohunda, in a statement in Ado Ekiti on Tuesday, said the name and shame publication was in furtherance of the state government’s zero tolerance for sexual violence in the state. Fapohunda said, “Under the initiative, names and photographs of convicted rapists are pasted on billboards in prominent public spaces in their communities and their council headquarters and as well uploaded on the website of the ministry of justice and other state government platforms in addition to being recorded in the sex offenders’ register and as well disqualified from benefitting from the governor’s power of prerogative of mercy.” The state government said it publicly shamed convicted rapists to serve as a deterrent to would-be sex offenders and task families on the upbringing of their members.
