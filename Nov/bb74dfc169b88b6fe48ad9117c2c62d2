Adelani Adepegba,Abuja The Air Force has neutralized several bandits and suspected cattle rustlers in the Kwiambana Forest area of Kaduna State. The airstrikes which took place on November 12, 2020, were carried out following reports that close to a hundred bandits armed with high-caliber weapons on motorcycles had rustled a large number of cattle and other livestock from Dankolo and Machitta villages. A statement on Saturday by the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations,  Maj. Gen. John Enenche, stated, “The bandits and the rustled livestock were subsequently spotted by a Nigerian Air Force aircraft on a reconnaissance mission at Kaboru village heading towards Kwiambana Forest. “The Air component, therefore, dispatched a NAF attack helicopter to the location which engaged the target area, leading to the killing of several of the bandits.” Footage showed the chopper bombing the outlaws as they fled in different directions on sighting the aircraft.
