Olaleye Aluko The Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, has promised to run an all-inclusive and people-oriented government, noting that the state government is working to achieve revitalisation of the economy. The governor stated this in Osogbo, while speaking at a special anniversary programme organised to commemorate the 2nd anniversary in office. He expressed gratitude to the people of the state for being the pillars of support for his administration. The governor said, “This is because as an administration, we are absolutely purpose-driven, motivated by the overriding passion to put smiles on the faces of our teeming citizens and to achieve accelerated revitalisation of our economy. “You are at the centre of our vision, and you inspire every move we take. It is a vision for a truly prosperous Osun that works for all classes of our people, with adequate physical and social infrastructure to support industry, and where there is abundant economic prosperity for all.’ “This is our pact with you. We will not be deterred by our challenges, but rather ride on their waves to get to our promised land. In the next two years, we shall double up our efforts and see to it that we take on the uncharted territories – for you, for us and the generation yet unborn. With your support and prayers, we know we shall not fail.” Copyright PUNCH.
