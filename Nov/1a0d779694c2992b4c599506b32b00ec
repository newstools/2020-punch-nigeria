Sodiq Oyeleke Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has expressed concern over security challenges experienced across Nigeria. He said this during a Stakeholders’ Engagement on Internal Security and Conflict Resolution held in Lagos State on Tuesday. The programme was organised by the Federal Ministry of Interior with the purpose of strengthening peace and security in the aftermath of the destruction. A statement after the programme quoted the governor as saying the coordinated arson that trailed the #EndSARS protests was a wake-up call to all citizens of the country and security organisations. He said, “The level of insecurity being experienced across the nation calls for serious concern, considering its implication not only on the socio-economic development and prosperity of our people but also on the unity and territorial integrity of our nation. “The importance of an effective strategy for peaceful resolution of conflict cannot be overemphasised. “That incident through which extensive damage was wrecked on public infrastructure and private businesses, is a wakeup call to all well-meaning individuals and organisations that we cannot afford to allow external forces or factors threaten or undermine our wellbeing and security. “We have to reignite the communication link between government and the people so that fifth columnists or conspiracy theorists will not be able to infiltrate and spread disinformation and misinformation that would jeopardise the future of our country or the opportunities available for our youths to contribute to the greatness of our country.” Aregbesola said the forum was the third stakeholders’ engagement which the Ministry of Interior initiated to strengthen peace across the country.
