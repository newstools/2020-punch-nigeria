Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Federal Government has said that the six Nigerians convicted for terrorism in the United Arab Emirates can appeal their conviction to the UAE Supreme Court. The government noted that the convicts lost their appeal but noted that they could file a fresh appeal to the apex court in the Emirates if they wished. The men who were convicted for funding Boko Haram allegedly made cash transfers in favour of the sect to the tune of $782, 000. Daily Trust reported that their relations claimed that the men were set up. The report further stated that two of the convicts, Surajo Abubakar Muhammad and Saleh Yusuf Adamu were sentenced to life imprisonment while the remaining four, Ibrahim Ali Alhassan, AbdurRahman Ado Musa, Bashir Ali Yusuf and Muhammad Ibrahim Isa were handed ten-year imprisonment, respectively.
