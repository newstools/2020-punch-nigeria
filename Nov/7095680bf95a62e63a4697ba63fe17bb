Peter Dada, Akure Barely one month after losing the Ondo State governorship election, the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, has set up a committee, to investigate allegations of anti-party activities, levelled against some members. The party also hinted of possible sanctions for party members found to have worked against its candidate, Eyitayo Jegede (SAN). This was contained in a statement titled, ‘Re: PDP leaders lament defeat in Ondo, sets up committee to probe loss,’ signed by its state Publicity Secretary, Kennedy Peretei, in Akure, on Saturday. The PDP statement read in part, “In the first place, it is no news that our party and candidate at the election, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, SAN, have approached the Elections Petition Tribunal sitting in Akure, to seek redress. To that extent, the final verdict on the election has not been heard. And it will be ,therefore,  preposterous to gloat over the same. “It is also disheartening that the same characters who received money from the APC leaders to sabotage, openly canvass and distribute money to buy votes for APC to turn round and lament ‘defeat’ of the PDP in Ondo State. “As a party, we are undaunted by this temporary setback. We have also put measures in place to appropriately address the anti-party activities of those APC or ZLP members masquerading as PDP leaders in accordance with provisions of our party constitution (2017 as amended)” Copyright PUNCH.
