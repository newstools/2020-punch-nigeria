Okechukwu Nnodim The Federal Government on Friday inaugurated the National Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, who performed the ceremony, said the inauguration was in line with the digital skills acquisition drive of government as captured in the National Economic Development Policy and Strategy. He said the centre was the first of its kind in Nigeria and was implemented by the National Information Technology Development Agency based on its mandate. He said, “The global paradigm shift from mere paper qualifications to proven skills, particularly digital skills, has necessitated the establishment of a high tech skill acquisition centre such as this. “The centre will serve as a leading hub of innovation, research and development, knowledge transfer and training in the areas of artificial intelligence, robotics and other emerging technologies. “In addition, the centre will create a vision for AI, develop an AI ecosystem, support data stewardship, while providing access to specialised technical skills in the country.” The Director-General, NITDA, kashifu Inuwa, urged Nigerian youths to take advantage of the initiatives and strategies deployed by government to empower themselves.
