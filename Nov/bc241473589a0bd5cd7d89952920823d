Kelvin Ekerete, Benin William Troost-Ekong says Sierra Leone should expect an angry Nigerian side when the team travel to Freetown for the matchday four of the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Tuesday. The Eagles surrendered a comfortable four-goal lead against the Leone Stars during their matchday three fixture game at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin, Edo State on Friday. With the reverse fixture set to take place at the Siaka Stevens Stadium in Freetown on Tuesday, Troost-Ekong stressed that the Eagles are yet to get over the disappointment of their 4-4 draw, but added that they would be ready when they travel to Sierra Leone. “We are all Nigerians and we were so disappointed with what happened yesterday (Friday) and I think if anything we were the most disappointed from everyone that was here,” the Watford player told The PUNCH. “We have to learn because we have a young team and we saw some things that weren’t good enough and we addressed all of that. “I think you are going to expect an angry team and to put it right what happened here. I don’t think we need to talk too much, I think we have to talk on the pitch on Tuesday and we are going to be ready for that. “Even if we had won the game 4-0, there would be things that we could have picked out to improve and that are what happen in every game. We have to grow and we are growing to be ready for the next game.” Despite the draw, the Eagles still top Group L with seven points from three games while the Leone Stars who they face on Tuesday for the reverse fixture in Freetown – have two points from three games.
