DENNIS NAKU Residents of Eleparanwo in the Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State are still in shock over the killing of a middle-aged man by some gunmen in a tricycle popularly called keke on Friday morning. The residents said the gunmen invaded the community in a tricycle around 6am and shot the man in the head. Some of them who spoke on a radio station programme monitored by our correspondent said the gunmen might have trailed the man for some time before carrying out the attack on Friday morning. A resident, who identified the deceased as a father of two, said, “The young man had been living in Eleparanwo for the past two years. We woke up this morning (Friday) around 6am and started hearing noises in the compound that our neighbour was about to go out for his business but some men in keke shot him at a nearby junction.” Similarly, another resident, who did not mention her name, said, “He was my very good friend. I know him very well. He was married with two kids. I was not around, but I was called that he was shot.” The dwellers lamented the high rate of crime in the area since #EndSARS protest that later turned violent made policemen to desert the streets. “I want to use this medium to plead with His Excellency to ban keke from Eleparanwo. The rate of criminality is too much. There is no security there again. We have never seen this kind of thing is our community,” an angry resident stated. When contacted, the spokesman for the police in the state, Nnamdi Omoni, said the incident had yet to be reported to the police. He said, “I don’t have that report yet. If they have not reported the incident to the police how do we know?” Copyright PUNCH.
