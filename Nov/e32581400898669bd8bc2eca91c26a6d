Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People has said no amount of distraction will deter the Ogoni people from demanding justice from the Nigerian state for the many years of neglect, environmental pollution, and human rights abuses in their community. MOSOP President, Fegalo Nsuke, stated this while addressing some stakeholders in Biara community, Gokana Local Government Area of Rivers State. Nsuke called on the Ogoni people to live together in peace and avoid all forms of internal conflicts, which, he said, were destroying the people’s potential for growth and development. He urged the people to hold onto the ideals of late Ken Saro-Wiwa, which he identified as development and justice. Nsuke said, “The Ogoni people will not give up on the demand for justice in Nigeria and I am glad to assure you that justice and freedom for the people is very near.” Nsuke said MOSOP had recently announced the creation of an Ogoni Development Authority in a move to address the lingering and costly Ogoni struggle.
