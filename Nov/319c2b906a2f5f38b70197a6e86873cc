John Alechenu, Abuja The Nigeria Governors Forum on Sunday expressed grief over the Saturday killing of 40 rice farmers by suspected Boko Haram Terrorists. They also expressed concerns over the state of the nation’s security architecture which they doubt its readiness to protect the lives and property of Nigerians. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘The Killing of Rice Farmers in Borno,’ signed by the Chairman of the NGF, who is also the Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi. He said, “Governors, under the platform of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum view this attack, like many before it, as obnoxious, wicked, unwarranted, and morally reprehensible. “This sad narrative raises serious questions on the general security situation in the country and around the capability of the nation’s security architecture. It also raises questions on whether or not there are adequate arrangements to protect lives and property. “Since insurgency engulfed the country more than a decade ago, each time it seems like the situation is coming under control, the enemy strikes again. This has happened consistently.” Fayemi promised that  the NGF would collectively review “these issues at our next meeting to forge the way forward.” Copyright PUNCH.
