Dele Ogunyemi, Warri The Delta State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, has accused the Governor Ifeanyi Okowa-led administration of allegedly abandoning the state-owned media houses. The opposition party said, “The State-owned Radio and Television Stations in both Warri and Asaba are now shadows of themselves.” This was contained in a statement signed by the state party Publicity Secretary, Sylvester Imonina, which was made available to newsmen, on Sunday. The party alleged that the Governor Okowa-led Government’s “penchant for promoting non-existing and/ or poor-quality projects, in order to mislead Deltans and non-Deltans outside the state on state of affairs; spends billions of Naira on privately owned Stations outside Delta State to the detriment of state-owned stations. “The preference for private Stations results in low patronage for the management of the state-owned media houses, which leaves them with the little resources at their disposal to keep the Stations afloat.” The statement further read, “It is common knowledge that the Commissioner for Information, who is a product of privately owned media House (where he was before assuming his present position), obviously feels more at home patronizing his people (private media outlets) outside the State, where he gleefully dishes out half-truths and outright falsehoods on the wobbling strides of the Government regarding amongst other things, the development of the State.” Copyright PUNCH.
