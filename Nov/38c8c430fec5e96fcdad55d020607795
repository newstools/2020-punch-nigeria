Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta Men of Ogun State Police Command have arrested a 70-year- old man, Hunsu Sunday, for allegedly impregnating his 15-year-old granddaughter. Sunday was arrested on Tuesday following a complaint by the aunt of the victim to the police. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this on Friday in a statement. Oyeyemi said the aunt lodged the complaint at Ado-Odo/Ota divisional headquarters that the victim has been living with her grandfather since the demise of her mother. According to the PPRO, the aunt stated further that the victim reported that her grandfather had been abusing her sexually for quite some time and she has been having strange feelings recently. He added, “Upon the complaint, the DPO Ado-Odo SP Michael Arowojeun detailed his detectives to the scene where the randy old man was promptly arrested. “On interrogation, he confessed having carnal knowledge of his granddaughter but claimed that he didn’t know that the victim is pregnant. “The victim has been taken to hospital for medical treatment.” The PPRO, however, said the Commissioner of Police Edward Ajogun has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspect to anti-human trafficking and child labour unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation and prosecution.
