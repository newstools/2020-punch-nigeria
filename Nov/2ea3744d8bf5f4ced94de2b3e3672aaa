Tukur Muntari, Kano A Kano State High Court presided over by Justice Dije Aboki on Wednesday ordered the arrest of a principal suspect, Amina Ibrahim, alias Gara, and two others, Zainab Salisu and Umar Aliyu, in connection with the disappearance of 10 children in the state. The three suspects were out of the 10 suspects dragged before the court by the Kano State Government on two counts bordering on conspiracy and kidnapping of the children. At the commencement of the Wednesday’s court sitting, the prosecution counsel, Tijjani Ibrahim, informed the court that he did not know why the three defendants were not in court. He, however, applied for separate trial of the seven present in court. The court granted the prosecution counsel’s application, but could not continue with the arraignment as one of the defendants (Christiana Uju) could not understand English language in which the charges were read to her. Aboki adjourned the matter till November 25, 2020, to get an interpreter. Copyright PUNCH.
