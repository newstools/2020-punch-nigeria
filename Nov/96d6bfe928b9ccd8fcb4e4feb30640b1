Sodiq Oyeleke The United States Mission has said Nigeria is not included in the US’ pilot visa bond programme. The US Mission in Nigeria made this known in a statement on its website on Tuesday. The outgoing administration of US President Donald Trump had issued a new temporary rule for African tourists. The new rule could require tourist and business travellers from some countries, most in Africa, to pay a bond of as much as $15,000 to visit the United States. The US State Department said the temporary final rule, which takes effect December 24 and runs through June 24, targets countries whose nationals have higher rates of overstaying B-2 visas for tourists and B-1 visas for business travelers.

Nigeria is not included in this six months pilot program.”
