Wall Street’s main indexes rose on Monday after Moderna became the second U.S. company in a week to report positive results from its COVID-19 vaccine trial, raising hopes of a quicker economic recovery from a pandemic-led recession. According to Reuters News, Moderna Inc soared eight per cent as it said its experimental vaccine was 94.5 per cent effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data from a late-stage trial. Nasdaq’s rise was limited as investors sold some of this year’s “stay-at-home” winners, although gains of about a percent for Dow were less stellar than those following a similar vaccine-related update from Pfizer Inc a week earlier, that briefly sent all the three main indexes to record highs.
