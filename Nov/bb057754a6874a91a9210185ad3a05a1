Peter Dada,  Akure The Ondo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has accused the state governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, of planning to fraudulently dole out large sums of money to the people of the state under the guise of the Social Welfare Financial Assistance Scheme. The State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr Kennedy Peretei, made the allegation, in Akure, on Thursday. He alleged that the scheme had a fraudulent undertone because there was a plan for it to be done in secret. Peretei said, “The same Government that is unable to pay workers salary, pensions and deductions, suddenly wants to dole out money to create pool of money in the event of his being thrown out of Government. “In the last couple of days, the Governor has acted in ways, suggestive of the fact that, he knows that, his stay in the Government House is but for a while. “The ceremony for this scheme was not made public for strategic reasons and the venue has been changed a number of time to give vent to its sinister motive.” However, the Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, Mr Alex Kalejaiye, denied the allegations. He said, “For a group of persons under guise of an opposition party struggling to find its bearing, nothing is spared in the name of comments. We feel their pains and their palpable frustration as it gets clear by the day that they have gone deeper in the mess that entangled them. “For such uninformed comments from the PDP, the best is to express empathy with them, especially when they have lost their bearing in the face of a looming leadership crisis.” Copyright PUNCH.
