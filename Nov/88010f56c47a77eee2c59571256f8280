Joseph Olaoluwa Cross River State on Tuesday opened bids for the Obudu International Airport project. Three construction firms participated in the exercise according to a statement emailed by the Chief Press Secretary of the State, Christian Ita. Speaking at the event, the state Commissioner for Aviation, Dr Jacob Enyia, explained that the project was first advertised in three national dailies in February while opening was scheduled for March but the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the bid plans. This prompted a reschedule of the event for October 27 which was again stalled by the EndSARS protest. Enyia, however, assured of the unwavering political will of Governor Ben Ayade towards the realisation of the project, citing a provision for it in the 2021 Cross River appropriation bill. He was quoted to have said, “We are convinced that the Obudu International Cargo and Passenger Airport holds a lot of promise for us as a government and people determined to raise the bar of Industrialisation and tourism in Nigeria.” The State House of Assembly represented by Nelson Ofem, House Committee Chairman on Aviation, commended the transparent bidding process and urged the executive to ensure that the eventual winner of the bid delivered a quality project. Representatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Cross River State Due Process Office witnessed the exercise. The three firms that bid for the project lauded the process, describing it as transparent. Copyright PUNCH.
