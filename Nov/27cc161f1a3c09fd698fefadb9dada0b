Peter Dada A security source on Saturday claimed that no ransom was paid for the release of the wife of Chief Olugbenga Ale, the Chief of Staff to the Ondo State governor. Mrs Ale and one other person were kidnapped on Thursday evening on Ondo-Akure Expressway at Owena area in the Idanre Local Government Area of the state while travelling from Lagos to Akure. It was gathered that the victims were rescued on Saturday morning by men of the Ondo State Security Network, also known as Amotekun Corps, in collaboration with local hunters and vigilantes in the area. A security source disclosed that some persons were arrested in connection with the crime. The source said, “The wife of the Chief of Staff has been rescued this (Saturday) morning. She was released without any ransom payment. She was rescued by Amotekun Corps officials and local hunters. “ The Commander of the Amotekun Corps, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, who confirmed the release of Mrs Ale said it was too early to disclose how the victim was rescued for security reasons. He said, “We thank God for the achievement. It was not easy but we were able to arrest some persons in connection with the matter. We are closing in on the hoodlums. We also arrested some persons at Elegbeka in connection with the killing of the monarch. But they are under interrogation and they are helping us with useful information.” Copyright PUNCH.
