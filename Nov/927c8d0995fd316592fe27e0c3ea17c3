Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva; and the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari, on Monday, failed to appear before the House of Representatives. Sylva and Kyari, among others, were to appear before the joint House Committee on Petroleum (Upstream, Downstream and Gas Resources). The meeting had recorded a large turnout by lawmakers, who waited for about one hour before resolving to postpone the meeting. The lead chairman of the joint committee, Musa Sarkin-Ada, in his brief comments before the postponement, said, “My dear honourable colleagues, we have been here today for the budget defence of petroleum with the minister, who said he was summoned to the Villa by Mr President. Seated by my right is my elder brother and leader, Hon Nicholas Mutu, Chairman, Gas; and to my immediate left is my younger brother but leader in the House, Hon Abdullahi Gaya, Chairman, Upstream. “We have been here for more than 30 minutes. Up till now, the minister who confirmed to all three chairmen of his willingness to appear is not here, though he called a while ago to say that he was summoned to the Villa by Mr President, and it is our belief that he is still with Mr President. “Given the circumstance, I want to suggest that we adjourn the meeting sine die, pending when the minister is ready to make appearance.” Copyright PUNCH.
