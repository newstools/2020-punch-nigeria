Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia The Umunneochi Local Government Area, Abia State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, has threatened to work against the party’s interests if the imposition of one Franks Chuks, as chairman, was not reversed. Party faithful comprising all ward chairmen and other stakeholders stormed the Umuahia headquarters of the party on Saturday to register their displeasure. They alleged that Chucks was unilaterally selected and imposed on the chapter by the LGA party chairman, Innocent Okoroafor, popularly known as “Sir White.” The group of party supporters led by Mr. Sopuruchukwu Ogbuewu, and Matthew Onyedikachi, explained that the most favoured candidate for the chairmanship seat, Charles Onu, was schemed out of the race by the LGA party chairman. The party members alleged that the local government party chairman and the party’s electoral officers failed to show up for the primary only to announce an unpopular candidate as chairman. They said, “If not rectified now, it means there is no APC in Umunneochi. We say no to electoral fraud and imposition. We are demanding for fresh primaries, but if the leadership of the party in the state refuses to grant us that, it means the APC in Umunneochi is not going anywhere.” When contacted, the APC state chairman, Donatus Nwankpa, in a telephone interview with The PUNCH, said, “We are not against people when they feel injured or when they feel there is something wrong in the process. We have an appeal panel set up for that purpose and we will investigate it.” Copyright PUNCH.
