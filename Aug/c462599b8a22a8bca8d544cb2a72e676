John Charles, Makurdi A 27-year-old apprentice drycleaner, Inalegwu Ochekwu, last Saturday allegedly raped a 10-year-old girl in Otukpo, headquarters of the Otukpo Local Government Area of Benue State. According to the victim, she was sent to look for her sister, a mission that took her to the shop, where the suspect was an apprentice. She stated, “When I went to their shop to find out whether he saw my sister, the man said no. But as I was going back, the man grabbed me. “As I was shouting and asking him why he was holding me, he used a cloth to cover my mouth and I struggled with him; he pressed me down, tore my clothe and forced himself on me and my body was stained with blood,” the victim said. A social activist, Mrs Julie Okoo, who reported the case at the Otukpo Divisional Police Station, commended the Divisional Police Officer, Supol Bawa, whom she said exhibited zero tolerance for rape cases. She thanked the DPO for facilitating the movement of the victim and the culprit to the command headquarters in Makurdi. When contacted, the state Police Public Relation Officer, Catherine Anene, said she had yet to be briefed on the incident. “I have not been briefed, because I have been busy with recruitment,” Anene said.
