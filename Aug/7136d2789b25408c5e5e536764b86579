Leke Baiyewu, Abuja An aide to a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has dismissed speculations that his principal is nursing an ambition to serve as the running mate to a national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the 2023. Dogara’s media aide, Turaki Hassan, said this in a statement titled: ‘Rt. Hon. Dogara is concerned about tackling the challenges of our nationhood than 2023’ made available in Abuja on Sunday. The statement read in part, “It has come to our notice that stories and images are being circulated on social media to the effect that His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara is running for the office of the Vice-President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria with the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for President in 2023. “Our initial decision was to ignore them since they are utterly baseless, but it appears that the promoters of this fallacy are unrelenting in spreading the falsehood and have now succeeded in making it sound believable to the extent that even some conventional and ‘credible’ media platforms are beginning to take it up. “In order to stop the further spread of this deliberate mischief, whose objective is yet to be ascertained, the public is hereby advised to disregard and totally discountenance the purported story and pictures for what they are – the handiwork of mischief makers.” Copyright PUNCH.
