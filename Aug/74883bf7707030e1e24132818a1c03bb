Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri An aide to a former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has accused his successor, Hope Uzodinma, of working against the interests of the All Progressives Congress. Okorocha’s media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, said this in a statement on Monday. Uzodinma had in a meeting with APC stakeholders at the Government House, Owerri, on Saturday, claimed that when he assumed office, Okorocha approached him with a request to disband all the panels set up to probe his two terms in office. In response, Onwuemeodo said while Uzodinma was professing the APC in the open, he was working with the opposition Peoples Democratic Party in secret. Onwuemeodo’s statement read in part, “Senator Rochas Okorocha has no problem with Governor Hope Uzodinma. The governor is the one creating problems for himself and also inventing problems where they do not exist. His latest media attack on Okorocha is one example of such ugly developments. “The government in Imo, as we speak or as we write, is the APC in name, but totally a PDP faction in structure and in actions. The governor has not done anything to show that he is of the APC and that his government is that of the APC. The government is Camp Hope government made up of those who were with him in his own faction of the PDP.” Copyright PUNCH.
