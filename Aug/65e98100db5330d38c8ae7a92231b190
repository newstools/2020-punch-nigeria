The Director-General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Dr. Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, says an empty 40-feet container has killed two persons in an accident at Ijesha area of Lagos. Oke-Osanyintolu said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Lagos on Saturday. He said the LASEMA management received a distress call via its emergency toll-free line at about 9:44 PM on Friday and activated a response team to the incident scene at Odo Olowu bus-stop at Ijesha. On arrival at the scene, he said it was discovered that a truck loaded with an empty 40-feet container, which had brake failure, had rammed into a stationary commercial truck and subsequently fell down. He said the truck driver was rescued by the agencyâ€™s responders and taken to the nearest hospital by LASEMA Response Unit Ambulance Service. Oke-Osanyintolu said two adult females, however, died and their remains had been taken to the mortuary. NAN reports that after numerous incidents of falling containers in Lagos and some parts of the country, the Federal Road Safety Corps had launched Operation Scorpion II to arrest and prosecute drivers of articulated trucks with unlatched containers.
