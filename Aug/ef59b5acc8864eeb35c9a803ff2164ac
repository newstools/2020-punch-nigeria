Johnny Edward Heartland goalkeeper, Ekoi Agbor, has told Saturday PUNCH he had to borrow N300,000 for the burial of his late mother, after being owed seven months salaries by the Naze Millionaires. Agbor’s mother, 86, passed away on January 15 and was buried in July. According to Agbor, his owed salaries plus bonuses is N3.7m. “I had to borrow N300,000 to bury my mother after Heartland failed to pay my outstanding salaries,” Agbor told Saturday PUNCH . The former U-23 shot-stopper also added that efforts to reach the club’s chairman Charles Ezekwem fell on deaf ears. “I have made several calls to the chairman but I never got a response on the matter,” Agbor said. Efforts by our correspondent to reach the chairman of Heartland, Ezekwem, proved abortive as he neither picked his calls nor responded to a text message sent to his phone on Tuesday by our correspondent.
