Tony Okafor,Awka The Anambra State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress says it has invited the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to probe funds in the 21 local government areas in the state under the administration of  Governor Willie Obiano. Anambra State  APC acting Chairman, Chief Basil Ejidike, said this on Monday after the party’s meeting at its Secretariat in Awka, the  Anambra State capital. Ejidike said, “It is worrisome and unfortunate the way and manner Governor Willie Obiano has been meddling and strangulating our traditional institutions and the local government areas. “The huge funds that accrued to the local government system in the recent years did not reflect the level of infrastructure development in our local governments. “For this, we call on the anti-graft agencies to swing into action and investigate local government funds in Anambra under Willie Obiano.” The State Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, C-Don Adinuba, described APC’s probe threat as preposterous. He said, “The APC calling Obiano’s government a failure is most ridiculous. We are not owing workers, pensioners and others, unlike APC governments in some states that are witnessing series of strikes.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
