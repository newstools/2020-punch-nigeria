John Alechenu, Abuja The National Secretariat, as well as the Akwa Ibom State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress, on Wednesday expressed sadness over the death of the Akwa Ibom State Chapter Chairman of the APC, Mr Ini Okopido. In a statement title, ‘APC Mourns Akwa Ibom State Chairman, Ini Okopido,’ by the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, in Abuja, the party said the late party chieftain died at the Ibom Multispecialty Hospital, Uyo. It read in part, “Our great party has lost a fine gentleman and grassroots politician who was at the forefront of mainstreaming the APC as the party of choice in Akwa Ibom State.” A similar statement by the Akwa Ibom State APC Deputy Chairman, Dr Ita Udosen, said the late chairman, will be sorely missed.
