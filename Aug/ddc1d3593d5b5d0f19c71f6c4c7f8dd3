It’s only the Counsel who are appearing and whose name is entered in the Counsel List (not more than 5 Counsel per Appearance) will be admitted into the Court and no more.” The three appeals coming up for hearing at the Supreme Court on Tuesday are against the July 4, 2020 judgments of the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal which affirmed the victory of Bello in the November 16, 2019 governorship election in the state. In separate judgments of the Court of Appeal, all of which were unanimous, the five-man panel of the court led by Justice Adamu Jauro had dismissed the four appeals for lacking in merit. The appeals dismissed were filed b PDP, SDP, Democratic People’s Party, and Actions Peoples Party. Although the Court of Appeal had in separate judgments dismissed four cases challenging the outcome of the poll, only three of the appellants were able to file their appeals at the Supreme Court within the time stipulated by law. Earlier on May 23, 2020, the three-man of the Kogi State Governorship Election Tribunal which sat in Abuja had in a split judgment of two-to-one dismissed the petition by PDP and its governorship candidate, Musa Wada, and affirmed Bello’s election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress. The majority judgment of the Justice Kashim Kaigama-led three-man tribunal dismissed Wada’s petition, while the minority judgment by Justice Ohimai Ovbiagele upturned Bello’s victory and ordered a rerun in seven local government areas of the state. The Court of Appeal in its July 4, 2020 judgment unanimously affirmed the tribunal’s majority judgment.
