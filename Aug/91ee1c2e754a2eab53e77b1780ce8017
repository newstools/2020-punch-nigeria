Peter Dada, Akure The candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the Ondo State Governorship election scheduled for October 10, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu on Wednesday described himself as the most experienced among the candidates contesting the election. Akeredolu, who is the incumbent governor is being challenged by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede; Mr. Agboola Ajayi of the Zenith Labour Party, among others. The governor spoke in Akure, at the inauguration of his governorship campaign council and committees for the forthcoming election. No fewer than 953 party chieftains were members of the committees. Akeredolu said “How many of them have more experience than myself? We have many experienced people on my side. The highest attainment on that side is Attorney-General. I was attorney-general for over 20 years. Isaac Kekemeke was attorney-general many years ago, Kekemeke was Secretary to the State Government and now I am the governor, who among them have such credentials. “My people have said it that the problem arose when somebody who should be campaigning for a position of a local government chairman was given a higher position or when somebody that should go to House of Assembly, was lifted above what he can cope with. Definitely, such persons shall misbehave.” He charged members of the campaign council to go back to their respective wards and campaign to ensure victory for the APC.
