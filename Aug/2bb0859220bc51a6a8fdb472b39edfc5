James Abraham, Jos The Department of State Services has invited a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr Obadiah Mailafia, to its Jos office. Mailafia confirmed the development to our correspondent in Jos on Tuesday. He said, “Yes, it true. The DSS invited me to appear in their Jos office tomorrow (Wednesday) by noon.” Mailafia said his invitation was not unconnected to an interview he granted an Abuja radio station, 95.1FM, on Monday.
