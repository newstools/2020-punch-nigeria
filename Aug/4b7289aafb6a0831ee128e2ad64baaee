The Edo State Governor and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has called on voters to come out en masse on September 19, 2020, to exercise their franchise without fear of harassment or intimidation as President Muhammadu Buhari has assured him of a free, credible and peaceful election in the state. Obaseki stated this while addressing party faithful during his reelection campaign rally in Ovia South West Local Government Area of the state. He said, “President Buhari has assured me that the Edo election will be peaceful. There will be peace in Edo; don’t be intimidated by the opposition, before, during and after the election. “They are not more than us in number; vote and make sure your vote counts. Stay back in your polling units to ensure they count your vote in your present.” Copyright PUNCH.
