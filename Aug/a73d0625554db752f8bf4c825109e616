Joseph Olaoluwa The National Union of Air Transport Employees and the Air Transport Senior Staff Services Association of Nigeria have directed all Arik Air staff to down tools while noting that it will commence strike actions from August 17. In a notice jointly signed by NUATE General Secretary, Ocheme Aba and ATSSSAN Deputy General Secretary, Frances Akinjole, the unions told all staff of Arik Air to assemble at designated positions in readiness for the mass action. Our correspondent learnt that the unions were aggrieved that the airline slashed the April salaries of its workers by 80 per cent and sent over 90 per cent of its over 1,500 employees on compulsory leave without pay. The directive is coming after the airline allegedly failed to address several issues raised by the unions regarding members’ welfare. Part of the statement from the union to the airline read: “We are now left with no choice than to inform the management of Arik Air that there is going to be a total withdrawal of services from the airline as from the next seven days. “All staff of Arik Air are therefore notified that with effect from August 17, 2020, all workers should down tools and assemble at places designated by union officials to be guided appropriately. “The notice shall remain in force until otherwise directed by our union.” Spokesman of the airline, Banji Ola, confirmed this development. However, he noted that the unions would be meeting with the Federal Ministry of Labour to iron out the issues. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
