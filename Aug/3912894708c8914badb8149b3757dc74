The 107th edition of the Tour de France got under way on the French Riviera on Saturday, two months later than planned and under the shadow of a coronavirus pandemic which could still shatter hopes of the world’s greatest bike race making it to the Paris finish line in three weeks’ time. Originally slated for June, stage one of the three-week epic over the peaks and plains of France embarked from Nice’s iconic Promenade des Anglais, but there were few spectators amid tightened health protocols.
