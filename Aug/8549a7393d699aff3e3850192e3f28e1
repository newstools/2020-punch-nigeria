Sodiq Oyeleke with agency report Bayern Munich are leading 1 -0 in their Champions League final encounter against Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday. Kingsley Coman netted for Bayern in the 59th minute after receiving a brilliant pass from Joshua Kimmich. The winger had four teammates to aim at and finds Coman unmarked at the back post. Coman subsequently sent a powerful downward header into the bottom corner. Bayern Munich won the European Cup for the sixth time on Sunday as Kingsley Coman’s goal gave them a 1-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in an engrossing Champions League final in Lisbon, completing a fantastic season for the German giants and leaving their opponents still searching for the trophy they covet more than anything. It was often a cagey final, with a bit of needle between the teams, but chances too, especially before Coman appeared at the back post to head in Joshua Kimmich’s inviting 59th-minute cross and wrap up a treble for a team who had already won the Bundesliga and German Cup. For the first time since 1998, the Champions League final featured two teams who entered the competition as domestic champions, a throwback to the days of the old European Cup when only a country’s title winners were allowed to enter.
