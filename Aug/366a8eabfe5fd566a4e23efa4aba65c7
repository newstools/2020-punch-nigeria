Ebenezer Bajela Former England international, John Fashanu, has revealed why he dumped his ambition of running for political office in Nigerian football, after previous futile efforts. Fashanu failed in an attempt to become chairman of the then Nigerian Football Association in 2002, with Ibrahim Galadima emerging winner. The 57-year-old told The PUNCH he would now prefer to be a behind-the-scene operator. He said, “I’m no longer interested in running for political office. “I don’t want to be NFF president or hold any office because of the too much stress involved. I want to live a nice life and enjoy my life. “I had the ambition 14 years ago but the desire is no longer there because now I am a kingmaker and not a king. “All I want Nigerians to expect from me now is exactly what they’ve had in the last 16 years, which are hard work, sweat and honesty. That is a word which is not used or believes in Nigeria very well.” Fashanu added that with the right administration, Nigeria would be a force to reckon with. “On the field, nobody can match Nigerian players who are many years ahead of others,” he added. “Some of their works are phenomenal and they are up there with the likes of Lionel Messi and Ronaldo. “Phenomenal talents just everywhere across the states, from Anambra to the North, I would say some of the world’s potentially best players but nobody has the sense to obligate them because we are all fighting each other every time.” Copyright PUNCH.
