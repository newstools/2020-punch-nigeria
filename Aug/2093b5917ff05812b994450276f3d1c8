Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Federal Government has faulted the closure of the business premises belonging to Nigerians by the Ghanaian authorities, saying it may consider retaliatory actions. The government also said it might drag Ghana to the Community Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States if found to have breached the sub-region’s Protocol of Free Movement of Peoples. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, said this in Abuja on Monday, during a meeting with a delegation of the League of Progressive Ambassadors of Nigeria led by its President, Mr Jasper Emenike, which briefed him on the harassment of Nigerian traders in Ghana. Ghanaian officials had sealed off the shops belonging to Nigerian traders in Accra for allegedly failing to have the $1m equity stipulated by the Ghana Investment Promotions Council. Onyeama noted, “What is the point of having an economic community if at the end of the day, each country will make laws and regulations that in contradiction with the protocol?  That is an issue that needs to be addressed.” The minister further said the Minister of Trade would engage his Ghanaian counterpart on the situation, adding that he (Onyeama) had earlier met with the Ghanaian High Commissioner, who provided information on the development.
