At least two people were killed in ethnic clashes in Ivory Coast following President Alassane Ouattara’s controversial announcement he would run for a third term, a hospital source, and local residents said Sunday. Young opposition supporters on Saturday took to the streets to voice loud and violent protest in several major cities, especially the southern cocoa-growing hub of Divo, after Ouattara accepted his party’s nomination for the October poll. “One person evacuated to the regional hospital succumbed to their injuries and died this morning,” said a hospital source in Divo, adding that “several were badly wounded with machetes”. Several local people also said they had seen the body of a teenager killed in a fire in a local bar.

He had planned to hand the reins to prime minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, but his presumed successor died of a heart attack in July. Six people had already died in violence following Ouattara’s August 6 announcement that he would run again, while 100 were hurt. The president and his supporters say a 2016 constitutional tweak has reset the clock on the two-term limit. “Going back on my decision was not easy” but “there is nothing preventing me from standing,” Ouattara said Saturday.
