Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia A former Managing Director of Diamond Bank and the All Progressive Grand Alliance governorship candidate in Abia State in the 2015 and 2019 elections, Chief Alex Otti, is set to declare for the All Progressives Congress. A statement by his media aide, Mr Ferdinand Ekeoma, said his declaration would take place on Friday, August 14, 2020, at his Ehi na Uguru Ward 5, in the Isialangwa South Local Government Area of Abia State. He hinted that the leadership of the APC at the highest level had promised to be present later for the state reception for Otti and others coming with him after the COVID-19 pandemic must have eased. Ekeoma pointed out that Otti left APGA because of “factionalisation and gross abuse of the foundational ideals and ethos of the party.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
