Johnny Edward Leon Balogun has expressed his displeasure at a challenge from Aberdeen’s Scott McKenna, which left him in a heap on his Glasgow Rangers debut, The PUNCH reports. The Nigerian made his Scottish Premier League debut Saturday, having only signed from Brighton less than a week ago. He produced a man-of-the-match display at the heart of Gers’ defence as they secured a vital win, thanks to Ryan Kent’s first-half strike. However, the 33-year-old emerged a bit dazed and dizzy at the Pittodrie stadium after cracking his head against a post in the win over Aberdeen. The Nigeria international wasn’t happy with the challenge from the Dons stopper McKenna but believes he’ll soon get used to Scottish football and was pleased to get off to a winning start with Rangers. “Wow. I think it was McKenna who pushed me into the goal post,” Balogun said during his post-match interview. “I wanted to get up but I couldn’t. It wasn’t quite lights out but it was a little bit tough for me. “I carried on playing after that and it wasn’t too bad thankfully. “Maybe I’ll get some dizziness and a headache later, but I have tablets for that, so it’s okay. “Was I unhappy with the challenge from McKenna? Obviously, because it shouldn’t happen. “But then again I didn’t die so it’s okay. It’s part of the game here, so I think it’s like a message, ‘Welcome to Scottish football.” Copyright PUNCH.
