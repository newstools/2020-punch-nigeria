Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi The Nigeria Labour Congress, Bauchi State council has given the Bauchi State Government a seven-day ultimatum to resolve the problems of pending workers’ salaries and other entitlements and pay them or face a strike action. The NLC Chairman in Bauchi state, Danjuma Saleh, gave the ultimatum on Monday during a press conference, at the Secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Teachers in Bauchi. He said government’s failure to pay workers might forced them to take a line of action that will not guarantee industrial harmony in the state within seven days. Saleh said some of the problems were removal of large number of workers from the payroll, cutting of huge portion of some categories of staff allowances for the month of June and July 2020, especially those in the health sector. Saleh said, “It is painful and mind upsetting when government are distributing palliative across the country to cushion the effect of COVID 19 pandemic, but on the other hand, people are denied thier legitimate earnings and salaries in this state. But the state Commissioner for Finance, Umaru Adamu, explained that some salaries were not paid because there were several fraudulent activities that the administration was trying to address He said, “Some people have been benefitting from these fraudulent acts and would want to see it end. We will not for once deny any worker his or her legitimate salary without any reduction.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
