Nike Popoola Mutual Benefits Assurance Plc said its premium income rose to N18.7bn at the end of the 2019 financial year from N15.8bn in the corresponding period of 2018. The Chairman of the group, Dr Akin Ogunbiyi, disclosed this during its 24th annual general meeting which was also conducted virtually in Lagos. He said, “The group recorded an 18 per cent growth in gross written premium from N15.8bn in 2018 to N18.7bn in 2019. “This performance was driven by a significant 41 per cent growth in our life business, from N6.1bn in 2018 to N8.5bn in 2019. “Our non-life business experienced a modest growth of four per cent from N9.8bn in 2018 to N10.2bn in 2019. “Gross premium income likewise increased by 16 per cent to N18.1bn from N15.6bn in 2018.” He said a more robust underwriting process resulted in a 13 per cent decline in net claims expense, from N7.0bn in 2018 to N5.9bn in 2019. The decline in net claims benefits resulted in an increase in underwriting profits by 77 per cent from N3.1bn in 2018 to N5.4bn in 2019, he said. Ogunbiyi said a growth in top line performance coupled with disciplined cost culture as well as highly rewarding investment activities ensured the group improved its profitability in 2019. Profit before tax increased by 172 per cent from N1.4bn in 2018 to N3.8bn in 2019, while profit after tax increased by 214 per cent from N1.1bn in 2018 to N3.6bn in 2019, he added. He said total assets grew by 14 per cent from N59.4bn in 2018 to N67.8bn in 2019, while total equity increased by 60 per cent from N9.1bn in 2018 to N14.5bn in 2019.
