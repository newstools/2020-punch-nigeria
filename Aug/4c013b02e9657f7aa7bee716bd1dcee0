Peter Dada, Akure Two months to the governorship election in Ondo State, one of the governorship aspirants of the All Progressives Congress, Mr Olanrewaju Kazeem, has defected to the Zenith Labour Party. Kazeem, who was one of the 12 aspirants of the APC and member of the Unity Forum of the party, stepped down for another aspirant, Chief Olusola Oke, and later became the Director-General of the Olusola Oke Campaign Organisation, shortly before the last primary of the party. The legal practitioner was said to have announced his defection on Saturday in Ikare Akoko, the Akoko North East Local Government Area of the state. He said he dumped the APC because the government since inception had not made any impact on the development of the state, urging residents to vote wisely in the coming election. He said, “Agboola Ajayi is the only alternative and solution to the bad and dysfunctional government of the Akeredolu government in Ondo State.” Mr Tope Okeowo, who is the Chief Press Secretary to the state Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi, confirmed the development, adding that Kazeem was ready to support Ajayi in the governorship election. “He (Kazeem) is now a ZLP member; he is ready to work for the victory of the party. Many other chieftains of the APC will soon join the party,” Okeowo stated. However, in a reaction, the state Chairman of the APC, Mr Ade Adetimehin, said the APC was waxing stronger on a daily basis. “Nothing is shaking us; the real politicians in the state are working with us and together, we shall win the election,” Adetimehin said.
