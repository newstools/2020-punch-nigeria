Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi, has resigned his membership from the Peoples Democratic Party. Ajayi, who lost the primary of the PDP to Mr Eyitayo Jegede, was said to have sent the letter of his resignation to the PDP secretariat in Ondo State on Monday. Ajayi said his decision was based on the call from his people that he should contest the forthcoming governorship election in the state. The Chief Press Secretary to the deputy governor, Mr Tope Okeowo, confirmed the development. “The deputy governor has resigned and will declare his defection to the Zenith Labour Party before the end of the work,” Okeowo said. However, the state PDP in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Mr Kennedy Peretei, said, “Agboola Ajayi has abused the welcome and privilege accorded him by our party supporters during his brief stay in the party. He also proved that he is desperate to become the governor of Ondo State. In the days to come, it will dawn on him that, he has squandered his goodwill with this decision.” Copyright PUNCH.
