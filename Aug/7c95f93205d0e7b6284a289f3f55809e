Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Task Force on Environmental and Special Offences Enforcement Unit, on Wednesday, destroyed over 150 illegal shanties, kiosks and shop extensions in the Arewa Community Central Mosque area of Agege. It was gathered that the area had been turned to an illegal market since the closure of the mosque by the state government over an attack on some COVID-19 task force personnel by some worshippers. The Chairman of the agency, Olayinka Egbeyemi, stated that the demolition was imperative as miscreants and illegal traders had degraded the area. He said, “The mosque was sealed off over four months ago due to an attack on officials of the Lagos State COVID-19 Task Force by some worshippers while enforcing the lockdown directives by the Federal Government. “The area has since become an eyesore and security threat to residents, including members of the public, as the entire area, including the surroundings of the mosque, has been occupied by miscreants and illegal traders.” Egbeyemi stated that the responsibility of the agency was to enforce both the Lagos State Environmental Law and Reform Law of 2018 in line with the THEMES agenda of the state government.
