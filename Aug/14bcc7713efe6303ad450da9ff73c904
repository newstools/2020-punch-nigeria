Kayode Oyero The President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Dr Samson Ayokunle, has charged church leaders in the country to be financially and morally disciplined and lead by example in every sphere of life. Ayokunle, who is also the president of the Nigerian Baptist Convention, stated this on Saturday at the virtual convention of the church. In a copy of his speech titled, ‘Today’s Church Suffers From Indiscipline- CAN President’ which was made available to journalists, the cleric lamented that indiscipline has robbed the church of its much-need progress. He said, “The theme for the convention this year is Moving Forward: Becoming A More Disciplined Church. This theme is crucial to the state of the present-day church. The church is now in a state where lack of discipline has led to many instances of sexual immorality, gluttony, financial impropriety, laziness, court cases, etc. The name of the Lord is being maligned in our society today because of the way Christians behave. Obscene dressing and all forms of impurities are happening in our midst. [READ ALSO] Speakers’ controversy: Obasanjo shuns NBA conference “Some Christians cannot be trusted for any noble assignment. There appears to be no difference between them and the unbelievers. Money in particular has become the god of some (if not many) Christians, including church leaders. What a shame to the church. The Lord of the Church is sad concerning the state of the church. We are robbed of our powers and molested by the children of Satan because of our careless living. “It is through discipline that we would remain holy and enter the kingdom of God. Hence, this year’s convention is a call to self-examination as individuals, family, church, and the convention. It is a clarion call to be more disciplined in areas where we have shown discipline and exercise discipline in areas where we lack such.”
