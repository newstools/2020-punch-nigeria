Joseph Olaoluwa The Nigerian Ports Authority has expressed excitement at the successful berthing of the biggest container vessel to ever call at any Nigerian port. The Maerskline Stardelhorn vessel which boasts of an overall length of 300 metres and 48 metres in width was received at the Federal Ocean Terminal, Onne in Rivers State at 4:20pm on Saturday, according to a statement by NPA’s General Manager Corporate and Strategic Communications, Jatto Adams. Jatto identified the ship as a container ship built in 2015 and currently sailing under the flag of Singapore. The vessel has a capacity of 9,971 TEUs. Part of the statement read, “The vessel, which was brought in from Fairway Bouy, Bonny with the aid of three tugboats operated by three of the Authority’s pilots was received by Ports Manager of the Onne Ports, Mr Alhasssan Abubakar. “The Authority is delighted to state that the landmark arrival of the biggest gearless Maerskline vessel at the Onne Ports is a result of management’s determination to improve the patronage of the Eastern Ports. “It is an indication of the fact that the Eastern Ports are equipped to receive all manner of vessels and an expansion of the options of consignees in the Eastern and Northern parts of the country.” NPA congratulated its team at the Onne Ports Management and appreciated all stakeholders at the Onne Ports for their cooperation towards the successful berthing of the vessel without any challenge. It restated its commitment to ensuring that all ports locations in Nigeria work at their optimal capacity and the repositioning of Nigerian ports as the hub in the sub-region. Copyright PUNCH.
