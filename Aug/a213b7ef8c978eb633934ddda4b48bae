Peter David, Benin City Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, on Monday, kicked off his re-election campaign in the Akoko-Edo Local Government Area with a promise to build on the good foundation his administration laid in the last three years and eight months. He said his economic blueprint would address the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Receiving the governor in his palace, the Otaru of Igarra, Oba Emmanuel Saiki II, asked God to guide him and bless his plans for the state. Obaseki said with the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, the people needed a leader with focus and one genuinely concerned about the well-being of the people of the state. He stated, “What you have seen in the last three years and eight months is small compared to what we have planned for our second term. We have the experience that our opponent does not have. “Our radical reforms have given us a solid foundation to build on. We will tackle security challenges in the state.” Also speaking, the Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu thanked the people for their support in the last three years and eight months and sought their continued support and votes come September 19.
