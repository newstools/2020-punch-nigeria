Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The outgoing Ambassador of Norway to Nigeria, Jens-Petter Kjemprud, on Friday, listed the organisation of two donor conferences that raised $1bn for the development of the North-East as one of his achievements in office. According to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Kjemprud said this during a virtual farewell meeting he had with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). The statement read, “The outgoing ambassador, in his speech, said his four-year tenure had grown economic relations between the two nations substantially, noting, in particular, the presence of more than 70 Norwegian companies in the country, as well as the important step by the Norwegian Sovereign Welfare Fund to invest in the Nigerian Stock Exchange. “He also cited, as a very important achievement, the organisation of two donor conferences driven by Norway that raised more than $1bn for the development and humanitarian assistance to the North East.” Shehu also quoted the President as expressing delight at the progress made in Nigeria-Norwegian relations in the last four years.
