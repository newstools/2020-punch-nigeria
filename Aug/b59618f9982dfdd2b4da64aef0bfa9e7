Kayode Oyero Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Saturday, visited the scene of a helicopter crash in the Opebi area of the state. The PUNCH had earlier reported that a Bell 206-B3 helicopter crashed into a fence separating two houses at 16A, Salvation Road, Opebi, on Friday. The copter with Nationality Registration Marks 5N-BQW operated by Quorum Aviation was about two minutes to reach its destination at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport when it crashed. The copter had three persons aboard and while two crew members died on the spot, the survivor in a critical condition died a few hours later at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja. Sanwo-Olu, who sympathised with the families of the victims, said he has ordered an integrity test to be conducted on the affected buildings.
