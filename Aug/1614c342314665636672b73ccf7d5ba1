Wolverhampton Wanderers boss, Nuno Espirito Santo, is proud of his side’s achievements given the size of their squad but admits the club will need to bring in new faces. Wolves’ 1-0 defeat by Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-finals on Tuesday brought an end to their season that lasted 383 days with 59 games. Wolves used just 21 players in Premier League matches this season, fewer than any other team while as many as eight players featured in at least 50 games in all competitions. “It’s a small squad and we must be really proud, but now we need to make good decisions so we do not make mistakes like we did before. We need more players that can help us,” Nuno, 46, said. “It’s a short break, you cannot stop and start again. We now have to prepare well for this period, we have to rest. This is the best way and we will look at how we did things,” he added. Arsenal’s FA Cup triumph means Wolves will not be a part of the Europa League next season in spite of their seventh-place finish in the Premier League. (Reuters/NAN)
