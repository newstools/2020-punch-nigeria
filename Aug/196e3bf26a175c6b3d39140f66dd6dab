Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Oyo State Government, on Tuesday, approved the notational promotion and payment of civil servants who were dismissed in 2012 but recalled by the present administration in the state. This disclosure was made by the Commissioner for Information, Culture, and Tourism, Dr. Wasiu Olatubosun, after the weekly virtual State Executive Council meeting. According to the Commissioner, the gesture was in line with the policy of the present administration to cater to all without prejudice and to give the workforce reasons to be satisfied. “Ninety-seven civil servants dismissed in 2012 have been recalled the moment this administration got to the office. The executive council today approved their notational promotion and payment of gratuity to the concerned ones. “This is in furtherance of the present administration’s drive to give cause for the working population to have cause to be happy for the job they do. It is also a testament to the fact that this is a government with a large heart that caters to the welfare of all,” he said. He added that the executive council also approved a contract for the completion of sections 1 and 2 of the 12.5 kilometers dualization of Challenge-Odo Ona Elewe-Apata Road in Ibadan. He stated that the contractor, Messrs Kopek Construction Nigeria Limited, agreed to repair all defective portions on section 1 of the road and to embark on the completion of section 2. “In consideration of displacement of Oyo State residents in this particular area, Oyo State government has deliberately channelled Section 2 to pass the CBN route so as to reduce the number of residents displaced by the construction.
