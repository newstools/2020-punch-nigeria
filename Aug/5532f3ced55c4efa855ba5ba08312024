The Chairperson of the Board of Governors of the Bank, Mrs. Niale Kaba, announced this after the election conducted virtually on Thursday. Adesina was first elected president of the Bank on May 28, 2015 and will begin his new term of another five years on September 1. Kaba said she was delighted that the Board of Governors had re-elected Adesina for a second term in office. “As shareholders, we strongly support the Bank and we will give him all the necessary support to carry forward and implement his compelling vision for the Bank over the next five years,” she said.
