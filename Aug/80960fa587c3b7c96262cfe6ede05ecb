Tony Okafor, Awka The Anambra State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, has chided the State Governor, Willie Obiano, for suspending the traditional ruler of Ukwulu, Uyanwa, in the Njikoka Local Government Area of the state, Igwe Peter. This was contained in a statement by the APC state Publicity Secretary, Okelo Madukaife, in Awka on Sunday. The party described Obiano’s action as “despotic.” Obiano had announced the monarch’s suspension last week after the traditional ruler hosted billionaire businessman, Arthur Eze. The business mogul had threatened to sue the governor for shortchanging monarchs in the state. While condemning the governor’s action, the APC said Obiano, “has not repented from playing the despot in handling the affairs of the state.” The opposition party said, “One would have thought that after the needless, unproductive and trouble-generating interventions in the kinship system of such noble towns as Oraukwu, Alor, Amanuke, Awka and, Aguleri, this rudderless state government would have known better than to wake up one day and pretend to have suspended the traditional ruler of Ukwulu. “Therefore, the vainglorious interventions with the affairs of towns, in order to enforce loyalty to a rudderless political persuasion, while killing free speech is misguided and ought to be condemned in naked terms.” Copyright PUNCH.
