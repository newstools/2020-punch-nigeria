Ebenezer Bajela Former Nigeria goalkeeper Dosu Joseph has opened up on a half-time altercation between him and a teammate during the U-23 national team’s 4-3 win over Brazil at the 1996 Olympics Atlanta. The Nigerians went into the break trailing 3-1, after Conceicao fired the South Americans ahead with a long-range free kick in the first minute, before a Roberto Carlos own goal in the 20th minute put the teams on level terms. But Bebeto’s goal and another Conceicao strike ensured that Nigeria went into the break with a two-goal deficit. Not seen by many people, Dosu told The PUNCH the row ensued between him and one of his defenders, though he refused to state his name. He said, “After the first half, we were walking towards the tunnel, the whole players were angry; I was very angry too. “Then I asked the defender, ‘Why did you allow the guy (Conceicao) to run over you like that for the third goal?’ But he responded angrily, saying, ‘go and find somewhere to sit please. Why didn’t you also stop the ball from going into the net?’” The Olympic gold medalist added, “We argued over it and later we were able to settle the issue. It was as if the tie was over and we were thinking of what would be happening in Nigeria. We felt Nigerians would have put off their televisions, went to bed, and woke up to see that we had been heavily beaten. “The coaches spoke to us and we put everything behind us and went into the second half and thank God we won the game 4-3.”
