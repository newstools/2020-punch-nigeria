Hindi Livinus, Yola The Federal Medical Centre, Yola, has successfully separated conjoined twins, making it the third time conjoined twins were separated in the hospital. At an occasion to celebrate the feat on Saturday, the hospital’s Chief Medical Director, Awwal Abubakar, noted that the success was attained as a result of the interventions of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd as well as other partners who donated modern equipment that enabled the hospital to carry out the operation. During the case presentation, Abubakar said the twins were delivered on December 12, 2019, through a cesarean section in Bayelsa State and were taken to FMC Yenagoa after they were identified to be conjoined.

Abubakar thanked the Nigerian Air Force for transporting the twins to Yola for free when they were 23 days old. The CMD noted that since they were brought to Yola, the FMC took charge of them free of charge which also culminated into the surgery which was also conducted free of charge. He noted that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a delay in the performance of the surgery but it was eventually conducted on August 20, 2020.
