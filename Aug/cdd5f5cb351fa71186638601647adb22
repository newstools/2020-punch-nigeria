JOHN ALECHENU The Peoples Democratic Party has demanded the speedy prosecution of officials of the All Progressives Congress indicted for alleged corruption. The PDP said the declaration by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), that some officials of his regime had been found wanting on the issue of corruption vindicated the party on its opposition to the “ongoing looting and re-looting of our common patrimony.” In a statement by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja on Saturday, titled ‘PDP to Buhari: Prosecute Corrupt Persons in Your Government…says President’s Assertion Vindicates Its Stance,’ the party said the delay in prosecuting the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, and indicted officials of the Niger Delta Development Commission and other agencies did not convey any sense of commitment by the administration to fighting corruption. Ologbondiyan said the PDP welcomed the President’s declaration admitting corruption within his regime but urged him to match his words with action by immediately charging those already indicted to court. The statement read in part, “The PDP notes that Mr President’s acceptance that there was an abuse of trust by persons in his government has vindicated its position that the Buhari administration is replete with treasury looters, who had been enjoying the cover of government. “The party, however, asserts that unless the President matches his assertion with the corresponding action against officials of his government, as well as leaders of the APC who are indicted for corruption, his declaration will still end up as one of the glib promises made by the APC and Buhari Presidency since 2015.” Copyright PUNCH.
