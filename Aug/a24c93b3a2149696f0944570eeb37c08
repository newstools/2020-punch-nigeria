Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri A former Senator, Athan Achonu, has predicted that the All Progressives Congress will win the Imo North senatorial bye-election whenever a date was fixed. Imo North senatorial seat became vacant when the former occupant, Benjamin Uwajumogu, died in Abuja, on December 17, 2019. Achonu, who had a brief stint in the Senate in 2015, said this while addressing party leaders in Owerri, on Tuesday. While asking party leaders to close ranks, he said, “We have the capacity to win this bye election but it would not be nice for us to go to the polls with a divided house. The party has the capacity to bring everybody together. We should go to the election as a united family. “My stay in the senate in the 8th Assembly was brief but my performance was legendary. I know I will do better if I am given the opportunity to represent Imo North at the senate this time.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
