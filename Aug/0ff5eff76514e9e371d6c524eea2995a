Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja #RevolutionNow activist, Omoyele Sowore, has lambasted the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for endorsing Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, who is facing corruption charges to the tune of N700 million. Ize-Iyamu was arraigned before a Federal High Court in Benin by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for allegedly receiving about N700m during the build-up to the 2015 general elections. The money was said to have emanated from a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke.

Responding to the development, Sowore, who is a former Presidential candidate, said it was funny that Buhari could feign ignorance of Ize-Iyamu’s corruption case. Sowore, who is the Publisher of Sahara Reporters, said this was the same way Buhari appointed Godswill Akpabio as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs and supervisor of the Niger Delta Development Commission despite being under probe by the EFCC for allegedly diverting billions of naira as governor of Akwa Ibom State. He tweeted, “The nature of dementia! Pastor Ize-Iyamu is undergoing trial for N700m scam,  Buhari pretends not to remember, hands him a flag to become next Edo governor, much like Senator Godswill Akpabio was asked to handle NDDC.”
