Dayo Ojerinde A nurse, Olamide Thomas, has said a lot of people go into depression because of societal pressures. Thomas, in an interview with our correspondent, said feelings of guilt and worthlessness, difficulty in thinking, concentrating or making decisions, mood swings, weight loss, and insomnia were some of the signs of depression. “It is a common and serious mental illness that negatively affects the way one feels, thinks and acts. It causes feelings of sadness and loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. “ Some of the causes or risk factors could be hereditary, exposure to violence, drug abuse, natural disaster, loss of jobs, neglect by families, loss of loved ones and childlessness,” Thomas said. She added that people who were depressed could also have suicidal thoughts and feelings of hopelessness. “Nigerians are advised to check-up on their family members and neighbours especially if they have not heard from them for a long time. When you notice changes in people, seek assistance from health workers where and when necessary. “Parents should always say words of encouragement to their unemployed children instead of insulting or comparing them with their contemporaries. People should also avoid the use of unpleasant or harsh words on people,” Thomas said. She also advised Nigerians to always seek medical attention whenever they feel unwell to avoid going into depression. Copyright PUNCH.
