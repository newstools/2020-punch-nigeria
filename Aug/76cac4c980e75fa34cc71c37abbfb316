Johnny Edward Bordeaux winger Samuel Kalu resumed training behind closed doors at Halin on Sunday after recovering from the coronavirus. A fortnight ago, the 22-year-old tested positive for COVID-19 on his return from Nigeria and was quarantined for two weeks afterward. “Kalu has returned to training this morning (on Sunday) after recovering from COVID-19,” the club wrote on Twitter. He missed Bordeaux’s pre-season friendlies against Angers and Saint Etienne but he is expected to play a part in their test game against Toulouse on Tuesday. He made 20 Ligue 1 appearances and scored once with an assist last season and will be eager to surpass that feat this term. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
