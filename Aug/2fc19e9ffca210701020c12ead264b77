John Alechenu, Abuja The Director-General of the Progressives Governors’ Forum, Dr Salihu Lukeman, on Monday said the leadership of the All Progressives Congress has been blackmailed into adopting a campaign strategy that compromises the health and safety of the people of Edo State. Lukeman, who said this in Abuja, added that he was speaking in his personal capacity and not as PGF DG Lukeman said, “The Peoples Democratic Party is already compromising COVID-19 protocols in its campaign but how can our government at the federal level correct that, if our own campaigns are also compromising it? “This is where the presidential task force on COVID-19 really needs to put its weight either together with INEC not just to regulate the process but of all other parties that will be contesting the elections, to conduct the elections based on the respect for COVID-19 protocol.” He also insisted that the APC campaign for the Edo governorship election must not be reduced to the quarrel between the former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki because what was at stake was beyond the two personalities.
