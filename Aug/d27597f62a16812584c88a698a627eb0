Abiodun Nejo, Ado-Ekiti The 2023 presidential campaign posters of Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, which appeared on social media have sparked public debate on various social media platforms across the state. The posters had a photograph of the governor dressed in a sky blue Agbada with a blue striped cap popularly called “Awolowo” was sponsored by the Chairman of Ikere Council area of Ekiti State, Mr Femi Ayodele. Ayodele said he did the posters, with the campaign message, ‘Support His Excellency Dr John Kayode Fayemi for President 2023’ “to show my unalloyed and uncompromising loyalty to Governor Fayemi” to dispel speculations that he was working against him. The council boss said the governor was fit enough for the exalted office considering his array of outstanding credentials, administrative shrewdness and political acumen, saying, “Fayemi’s commitment, resourcefulness and pedigree put him in good stead to lead Nigeria in the next political dispensation.” However, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Fayemi, Yinka Oyebode, who said his principal did not know anything about the posters, said, “The sponsor is merely expressing a personal opinion.” He urged members of the public to discountenance the posters.
