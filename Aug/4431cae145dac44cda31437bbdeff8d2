Friday Olokor, Abuja The Independent National Electoral Commission has threatened to stop the elections in Edo and Ondo states if the actions of political actors lead to cogent and verifiable threat or breakdown of law and order before or during the elections. The decision, according to a statement issued on Thursday by its National Commissioner and chairman of its Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, was made after its meeting on a number of issues including preparations for the Edo and Ondo elections. Okoye said, “The commission wishes to reassure the people of Edo and Ondo states of its determination to conduct credible and safe elections in the two states. The commission shall not hesitate to discontinue the process should the actions of political actors lead to cogent and verifiable threat and/or breakdown of law and order before or during the elections. “Going forward, the commission will work and collaborate with the security agencies to contain all incidents or threats of violence before and during the elections. Regulatory agencies with roles in the elections, especially those dealing with insecurity, hate speech and abuse of mass media, must step up their activities and ensure that all those that break the law are held to account.” Copyright PUNCH.
