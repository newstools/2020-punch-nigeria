Peter Dada, Akure The candidate of the Zenith Labour Party and Ondo State Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi, has picked a former Commissioner for Works, Mr Gboye Adegbenro, as his running mate ahead of the October 10 governorship election. Adegbenro, an engineer, was a commissioner during the administration of Olusegun Mimiko. It was gathered that the deputy governor and the leadership of the party agreed on Adegbenro during a meeting. The former commissioner’s name was said to have been sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission in order to beat the final deadline of the commission on Tuesday. The state Chairman of the ZLP, Mr Joseph Akinlaja, confirmed the development on Sunday. He said, “Yes we have picked a running mate his name is Gboye Adegbenro. He would be announced tomorrow (Monday).” Ajayi, who formally announced his defection to the ZLP last Friday in Akure after he had resigned from both the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party, is expected to kick-start his governorship campaign any moment from now.
