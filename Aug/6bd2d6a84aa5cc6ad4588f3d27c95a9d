Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe Some operatives of the Delta State Police Command have allegedly assaulted and extorted a resident of the state identified simply as Samuel. PUNCH Metro learnt that the operatives attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the command, on Saturday, August 22, 2020, accosted Samuel and his girlfriend, who were on a motorcycle in the Koka area of Asaba. It was gathered that the policemen allegedly dragged the victims from the motorcycle into their waiting vehicle and when Samuel and his girlfriend demanded where they were being taken to, the SARS personnel allegedly dealt machete blows on the man’s leg. A human rights activist, Harrison Gwamnishu, alleged on Instablog that the SARS personnel extorted the sum of N15,400 from the victims before they were released. The post read, “The SARS officers dragged him from the okada and forced him and his girlfriend into their car. The victims demanded to know where they were being taken to but the officers responded by macheting Samuel’s leg. “They seized his ATM card and forced him to disclose his pin and withdrew N15,400 from his account. I’m calling on the Delta State government to please intervene by putting an end to the constant harassment Nigerians from SARS.” When contacted by PUNCH Metro, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Onome Onovwakpoyeya, said she would get back to our correspondent, but she had yet to do so as of the time of filing this report.
