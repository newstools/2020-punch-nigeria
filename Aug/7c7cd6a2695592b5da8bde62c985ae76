Adeyinka Olaseni, Benin The President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Dr Philip Omobude, has urged the Federal Government and its agencies to provide an enabling environment for the people of Edo State to vote for the candidate of their choice in the gubernatorial election scheduled for September 19. Governor Godwin Obaseki, who is the standard bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party, and Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the All Progressives Congress are considered front runners in the race. The PFN leader said, “There have been too many acts of violence. We urge President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene so as to douse the political tension in the state. “We yearn for an election where votes will count, a process devoid of intimidation, thuggery, snatching of ballot boxes and killings. All we want is a peaceful election and we hope that all agencies and parties involve will work together to realise this.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
