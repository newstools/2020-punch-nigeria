JOHN CHARLES Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Saturday said that the state opposition political, the All Progressive Congress, reached out to him to return to the party ahead of the 2023 elections. Ortom, who disclosed this at the state congress of the Peoples Democratic Party held at Aper Aku Stadium, Makurdi, said that after consultations with some of his close allies and the PDP state congress, he rejected the offer. The governor said he would communicate his decision not to leave the PDP to his ‘friends’ in the APC. Ortom said, “It is true that the APC has invited me to come back to APC and they are propagating that (he is leaving the PDP) and this is far from the truth. I told them I’ll come and ask you (the state congress); Do you want me to decamp to APC?” The question was followed by a resounding “No, no, no”, and it prompted the governor to say, “So, I am comfortable with my people (PDP) and I’ll remain in the PDP and I will communicate this to my friends in the APC. I will tell them that I consulted with you and you asked me not to leave.” He also said that he was humbled by the vote of confidence passed in him by the congress, adding, “I’ll not fail you or let you down and we shall be victorious.” Ortom also assured the party that by the grace of God, the party would sustain the gains of 2019 through to 2023, adding that the successes recorded were made possible by the support of party members.
