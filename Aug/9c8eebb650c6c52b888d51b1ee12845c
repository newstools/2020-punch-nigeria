Tony Okafor, Awka The Indigenous People of Biafra, on Thursday, said it would no longer tolerate the unwarranted hounding of its members across Biafraland. In a statement by the group’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPOB accused the army, Department of State Services and the police of arresting and detaining its members in the area without any cause. While warning the security agencies to “stop testing our will,” IPOB wondered why herdsmen and other violent groups, who allegedly kill, maim and rape innocent Nigerians, were being handled with kid gloves. Powerful said in most cases, the security operatives would hunt and arrest its members for just tuning to the Radio Biafra station. “We hereby demand immediate stoppage of the incessant harassment and arrest of IPOB family members in different parts of Biafraland,” the statement read in part.
