Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party, former President Olusegun Obasanjo and former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar were among those who congratulated the spokesman for the Coalition of United Political Parties, Imo Ugochinyere, on his 38th birthday on Monday. In a letter signed by the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, the party said it was happy to be identified with Ugochinyere’s “exceptional display of patriotism and doggedness in fighting and protecting democratic principles.” The statement dated August 3, 2020, was titled ‘Happy birthday to a fearless fighter for democracy’. The party said, “For speaking the truth to power, posterity will record you well, as by so doing, you are stopping evil from thriving in our country.” Obasanjo, in his letter titled: ‘Felicitations on your 38th birthday’, said, “They said life begins at 40, Ugochinyere is two years away from beginning life. “My prayer for you is that by the time you clock 40 years, you would have matured enough to begin life with a bang.” Atiku, in his letter, lauded Ugochinyere for his commitment to the struggle for better democratic governance and accountability in Nigeria, even at personal risk. He wrote, “The passion you have brought into your engagements and the consistency and unwavering devotion that you have demonstrated in the struggle to defend our democracy are worthy of emulation, especially by the youth. Thank you for your commitment to a better Nigeria.” Others, who have written to congratulate Ugochinyere include a former Kano State Governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso; and the Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State, Kelechi Igwe, among others.
