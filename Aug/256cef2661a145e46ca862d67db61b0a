PATRICK ODEY The police in Akwa Ibom State have arrested a 39-year-old female pastor, Mrs Mnayen Odiuotip, and five others for alleged child theft and trafficking in the state. Odiuotip, a pastor of a church on Marina Road, Oron Local Government Area of the state, was apprehended along with her accomplices while the baby was rescued from them. A statement on Saturday, by the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Nnudam Fredrick, said the suspects were arrested based on intelligence reports. He alleged that a suspected child trafficking kingpin, one Rose Ekpenyong, allegedly sold a baby girl to the pastor in 2018. The PPRO stated, “The unwavering efforts of the command towards crime prevention in the state paid off with the arrest of a child theft and trafficking syndicate. The suspects were arrested in June 2020.’’ Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
