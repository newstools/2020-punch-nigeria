Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The Kaduna State Government has reviewed a 24-hour curfew imposed on two out of four local government areas in the state to contain the killings in the southern part of the state. The decision, according to the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, was based on advice by security agencies.
