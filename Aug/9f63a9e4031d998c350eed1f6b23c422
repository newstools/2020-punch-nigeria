Dayo Ojerinde THE Rivers State Commissioner for Information and Communications, Mr Paulinus Nsirim, has described Governor Nyesom Wike as an advocate of a violence-free election. Nsirim, in a statement titled, ‘Re: Edo polls and threats of violence’, said it was unfortunate that an article published in national daily on Monday, gave the impression that the governor subscribed to violent polls. The statement read in part, “The attention of the Rivers State Government has been drawn to an article titled, ‘Edo polls and threats of violence,’ published in the Politics page (Page 14) of The Nation Newspaper, August 24, 2020. “We will refrain from taking issues with all the snide innuendos and direct attacks casting libellous aspersions on the personality of the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike. “It is quite provocative and disingenuous to invoke situations, circumstances and events over which one has incomplete knowledge about, as illustrations to justify a conclusion, as the write up has so brazenly concocted as regards the election in Rivers State. “Addressing the unpleasant and complexities that are already defining the forthcoming September 19, Edo State governorship elections, we wish to place on record that before every election he has contested, Governor Nyesom Wike, has always been the prime advocate for violence-free polls and has loudly insisted that all election must be free and fair and the votes of the people must count. “Most importantly, he always advocates that people should be vigilant and guard their votes to make sure every vote counts.” Copyright PUNCH.
