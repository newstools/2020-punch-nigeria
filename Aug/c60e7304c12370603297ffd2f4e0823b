Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt THE Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has expressed confidence that the defection of a former Leader of the Rivers State House of Assembly, Dr. Chidi Lloyd, would not adversely affect its political fortunes. Lloyd, a former political associate of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, was the Director General of the 2019 Rivers APC Governorship Campaign Council. He defected from the APC to the Peoples Democratic Party and was received by Governor Nyesom Wike and other PDP leaders at the State Government House, Port Harcourt on Monday. Spokesman for the APC in Rivers State, Ogbonna Nwuke, made the party’s position known in a statement titled, ‘Chidi Lloyd’s Exit: Good Riddance To Bad Rubbish,” and issued in Port Harcourt on Tuesday. Nwuke said, “We want to state categorically that the exit of Hon. Lloyd would have no effect on the fortunes of the APC. On the contrary, APC members in Emohua Local Government Area are jubilating over his exit. “Party members from Emohua have remained adamant and insistent right from 2014 that they do not want him in their midst. For these grassroots politicians and members of our great party, Lloyd’s departure amounts to good riddance to bad rubbish.” Copyright PUNCH.
