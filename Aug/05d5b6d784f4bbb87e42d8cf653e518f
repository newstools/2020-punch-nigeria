John Charles, Makurdi Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Thursday, said he would use the rule of law to ensure that any Fulani herdsmen who establish a vigilante group in the state are jailed. Fulani organisation, Miyeitti Allah Kauta Hore, had at a press conference in Abuja vowed to establish vigilante groups in all states of the federation to combat insecurity. In his response, Ortom through his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, warned the Fulani group not to come to his state, stating that their motive was to carry their heinous activities to another level.

No room for the to establish vigilante group in whatever kind, when I confronted them they said they would not use the vigilante group of Nigeria. That one will not operate here. “We have our own vigilante that operates here, we have community policing in which we are recruiting now and livestock guard that takes care of herdsmen in active support with security men. “So, no single vigilante group of Miyeitti Allah will come to Benue State to make any noise here. For us in Benue State, we believe in the rule of law and we will jail them.”
