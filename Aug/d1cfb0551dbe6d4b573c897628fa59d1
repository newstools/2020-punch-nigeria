To avert severe flooding predicted by the Federal Government, the Edo State Government has called on residents to commence the clear gutters, canals, and moats in their areas. The government made the call in a statement emailed to our correspondent by the Special Adviser to Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie. Osagie stressed the need for residents to adhere to the warning. He said, “Last week, the Federal Government through the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency warned that Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Rivers and Bayelsa states which are contiguous to River Niger will likely experience severe flooding in September. “To mitigate the impact of this natural disaster that may affect us in Edo State, all hands must be on deck. “We must desist from dumping refuse in waterways as the indiscriminate dumping of dirt and refuse into gutters and other water channels can cause blockage and exacerbate the impact of the coming floods.” Osagie noted that the Edo State Government was poised to combat flooding across Edo by embarking on several water detention pond projects, which include strengthening the state’s drainage systems and completing erosion and flood control projects in the three senatorial districts of the state.
