Oladimeji Ramon Conveners of a splinter group within the Nigerian Bar Association have written to notify the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami (SAN), of the existence of their newly-formed New Nigerian Bar Association. Their letter, dated August 28, 2020, was on the letterhead of the NNBA, with a logo of the lawyer’s wig and the scale of justice. It was titled, “Re: Notification of the formation of New Nigerian Bar Association,” and signed by Nuhu Ibrahim (Convener 1) and Abdulbasit Suleiman (Convener 2). In the letter, the splinter group said, “The formation of the new association has become imperative and expedient especially flowing from the activities, disposition and most recently, the decision of the Nigerian Bar Association-NEC (National Executive Committee) which apparently failed to take into consideration our national interests and particularly do not promote the unity of our indissoluble country, Nigeria. “Sir, the New Nigerian Bar Association believes in the ideals that bounds (sic) our country together as echoed in our National Anthem: ‘The Labours of our heroes past shall never be in vain.’ “You are, however, to be further informed that work is in progress with regards to all the nitty-gritty of the formation of an association such as this to which we shall keep you updated.” The emergence of the NNBA was part of the fallout of the decision of the NBA to disinvite the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, from speaking at its recently concluded Annual General Conference.
