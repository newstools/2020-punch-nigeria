Wale Oyewale, Ibadan GOVERNOR Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has forwarded a list of eight nominees for appointment to the board of the state Independent Electoral Commission to the state Assembly. The nominees are: Isiaka Olagunju (Chairman), Adeniyi Babatunde, Alhaja Ganiyat Saka, Mr. Olanrewaju Emmanuel, Chief Kunle Agboola, Mr. Remi Ayoade, Mr. Sunday Falana and Mr. Adeojo Elias as members. Speaker of the House, Adebo Ogundoyin, who read Makinde’s letter to his colleagues during plenary on Tuesday, said, “The board members are eminently qualified to be appointed as members of OYSIEC to oversee and conduct elections into our local government areas based on their track records.” According to him, the board of OYSIEC should have been constituted long before now, but for the court case instituted by the sacked local government chairmen. Ogundoyin further said, “I am happy that the Oyo State governor has forwarded the list of OYSIEC members for screening and confirmation to us in the House. I have no doubt that when the board is constituted, it will conduct credible local government elections devoid of rancour, violence and malpractice.” Copyright PUNCH.
