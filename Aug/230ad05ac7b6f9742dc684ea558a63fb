Nike Popoola Allianz Nigeria Insurance Plc, a local operating entity of the global insurance company, Allianz, said it paid N1.8bn claims to its claimants in the first quarter of 2020. The Chief Operating Officer of the company, Owolabi Salami, said this in a statement titled ‘Allianz Nigeria Insurance Plc pays N1.8bn claims in Q1 of 2020’, which was obtained on Friday. He said the payment was 130 per cent increase from N800m paid out in the same period of 2019. The company’s gross written premium rose by 47 per cent to N4.2bn in Q1 2020 from N2.9bn in the same period in 2019. It recorded an investment income of N301m despite the fall in investment and treasury bill rates, it stated. Salami said the success attained so far could be attributed to the tenacity and bravery of the people who worked in the organisation. “The company will remain unwavering to deliver on its promise of paying claims despite the present economic downturn,” he said. He recalled that earlier in the year, the company launched a nationwide campaign to settle motor claims within 60 minutes, and to date, scores of claims had been settled within the stipulated time. The statement said Allianz Nigeria was at the forefront of revolutionising the insurance industry especially in the area of satisfying customers’ needs. It stated that it had scaled through the first quarter with promising results. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
