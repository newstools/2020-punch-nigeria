Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Monday went live with the Nigerian Gas Transportation Network Code, as dealers in the gas based industry signed the maiden Network Code Framework Agreements. In his address at the NGTNC go-live ceremony, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said he had mandated the Department of Petroleum Resources in February to ensure full operations of the code within six months. The minister, in a conference that was held via zoom, stated that the code would further enhance gas reserves growth to support domestic and export projects. He noted that it would expand domestic gas supply and address the perennial challenge of gas flaring with its attendant waste and environmental impact. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
