Chima Azubuike, Gombe The Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya, on Tuesday, lamented that the immediate past administration in the state wasted over N3bn on an abandoned mega park project. Yahaya stated this when he inspected the uncompleted park, which was started by the administration of his predecessor, Ibrahim Dankwambo. The governor said, “Water passing through this building has caused a lot of havoc to the college of education nearby and that school is very dear to us. Today, it has close to 10,000 students. “This project was supposed to cost N6.2bn; it started in 2012 and was supposed to last 28 months; it should have been completed in 2014, but they abandoned it. About N3bn has been paid; there are certified works worth N420m; records have not been found. “Over N3bn is wasted and has caused havoc to the environment; you hold whoever that decided to put these structures in place responsible and liable for whatever happens to us. Yahaya directed contractors and consultants handling the project back to site, and asked them to be guided by all the protocols of professional development and control. Dankwambo had yet to reply to a text message sent to his mobile phone for his reaction as of the time of filing this report. One of his aides, however, promised to contact him and get back to our correspondent, but had yet to do so as of the time of going to press. Copyright PUNCH.
