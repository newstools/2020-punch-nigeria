Peter Dada, Akure A businessman, Mr Jimoh Ibrahim, has formally joined the ruling All Progressives Congress in Ondo State, saying he will assist Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to win the forthcoming governorship election. Ibrahim, a former member of the Peoples Democratic Party, vowed to ensure that the party would die in the state, adding that the Zenith Labour Party was not a threat to the APC. At the defection ceremony held at Igbotako in Okitipupa Local Government Area of the state, on Friday, Ibrahim was received by the state chairman of the APC, Mr Ade Adetimehin, Akeredolu and some other chieftains of the party in the state. He said, “I do not want to sound proud, but I revived the PDP in this state. I know how I revived the party and I’m going to use the same strategy to kill the PDP. I have received the broom from our party chairman here. This night, I will do something. I will give the PDP its poison. I know how I revived the party; I will poison the party to death again. Where is Zenith Labour Party in this state?” Copyright PUNCH.
