Adelani  Adepegba,Abuja The United kingdom has advised British nationals against non-essential travel to Nigeria on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. It said based on currently available information, there was a high risk of exposure to COVID-19 in the country. In a travel advice on its website, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said individuals entering or returning to the UK from Nigeria “will be required to follow additional UK border measures, which includes self-isolation for 14 days.” If travel is essential, the FCO urged travellers to discuss their plans with a health professional, adding that this was important for those at higher risk of severe COVID-19. It admonished intending travellers to consider the risk at all destinations, including any transit countries and the risk during travel itself. The government also urged them to check with the airline/tour operator about physical distancing measures or other measures in place to reduce risk during travel. “Follow the latest social distancing guidance, including any local requirements and maintain good hand, respiratory, and personal hygiene at all times. This may be particularly important if staying with friends and family,” the advisory cautioned. The FCO further advised British nationals to follow local guidelines on self-isolation and testing if they developed COVID-19 symptoms while abroad. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
