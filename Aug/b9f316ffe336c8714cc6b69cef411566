Peter Dada, Akure A legislative aide to Abiola Makinde, the member representing Ondo East/Ondo West Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Mr Adeniyi Adeyosoye, has quoted his principal as saying last Saturday’s local government elections in Ondo State exposed the unpopularity of the ruling All Progressives Congress. Makinde, who is a member of the African Democratic Congress, was said to have condemned the election, which he said was marred by irregularities. According to the aide, the APC recruited thugs, who unleashed violence in various units and wards in Ondo West and Ondo East Local Government areas, to scare voters. “They ensured that members of the APC were electoral officers; they brought out thugs with members of the NURTW to harass people, beating up everybody. “They snatched ballots boxes and took the materials to their houses and thumb-printed them. We have video evidence of this act. They engaged in the act of violence because they are not popular in the state.” He said the party was still consulting on its next line of action. Reacting to the allegations, the Ondo State APC Publicity Secretary, Mr. Alex Kalejaiye, said, “As stakeholders in the state’s project, members of the APC managed unprovoked attacks from members of the other political parties with unusual degree of maturity to ensure the success of the election.” Copyright PUNCH.
