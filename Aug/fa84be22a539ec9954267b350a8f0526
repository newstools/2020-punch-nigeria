Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja An aide to Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has written a petition against the Peoples Democratic Party for constantly referring to Uzodinma as the “Supreme Court Governor of Imo State,’ according to a report by The Cable. Uzodinma, who came 4th in the 2019 governorship election, was declared the winner in January after the Supreme Court added results from 388 polling units to his original score. The court also sacked Governor Emeka Ihedioha of the PDP. However, the PDP has been describing the governor as a ‘Supreme Court’ governor ever since his inauguration. In a petition which was forwarded to the National Judicial Council, the Attorney-General of the Federation and the National Assembly, Uzodinma through his Special Adviser on Political Matters, Batos Chikezie, asked that Ogubundu Nwadike, the Publicity Secretary of the PDP in the state, and other loyalists be stopped from using the “supreme court governor” tag as it is derogatory and misleading. Chikezie said since the Supreme Court’s decision on January 14, 2020, “Nwadike continued to refer to Uzodinma as the Supreme Court governor and Chief Emeka Ihedioha as the elected governor of the state in the print, electronic and social media.” The aide asked that the NJC through the registrar of the Supreme Court ensures that Nwadike was made to stand trial for “persistently making a mockery of the decision and proceeding of the court on the Imo State election, thereby making them look compromised and biased in the eyes of the public which is a dent on their integrity and pedigree.” Copyright PUNCH.
