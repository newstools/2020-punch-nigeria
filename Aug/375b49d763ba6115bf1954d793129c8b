Joseph Olaoluwa The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency has pledged to improve the welfare of dockworkers as guaranteed in the International Labour Organisation Decent Work Agenda. The agency’s Executive Director, Maritime Labour and Cabotage Services, Mr Victor Ochei, gave the assurance in Lagos during a meeting of the National Joint Industrial Council, according to a statement by NIMASA. The statement titled ‘NIMASA Assures Dockworkers of improved welfares’ was emailed by Head, Corporate Communications, Philip Kyanet, on Tuesday. The meeting discussed a revised minimum wage and improved living standard for dockworkers through the Collective Bargaining Agreement initiative endorsed by NIMASA and NJIC in 2018. Ochei was quoted to have said, “Dockworkers are integral to efficient and effective stevedoring operation and the NJIC has remained resolute in ensuring harmonious working relationships through the principle of tripartism and the execution of Collective Bargaining Agreements on minimum standards for the dock labour industry.” The representative of the Federal Ministry of Labour, Mrs Joyce Udoinwang, and the President-General of the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria, Adewale Adeyanju, equally expressed their desire to seek better welfare for dockworkers.
