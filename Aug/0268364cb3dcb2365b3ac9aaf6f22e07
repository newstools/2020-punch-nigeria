Peter Dada, Akure A former Governor of Ondo State, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, has said he would, at appropriate time, reply to his successor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu who accused him of abandoning some projects during his administration. Akeredolu, while inaugurating some projects on the campus of the Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa, last week accused Mimiko of abandoning projects on the campus of the institution. However, Mimiko who spoke while receiving the Ondo State deputy governor, who is the candidate of the Zenith Labour Party, Mr Agboola Ajayi, at his residence in Ondo town on Friday, said it was not time to reply to Akeredolu. The two-term governor  described the ZLP candidate as a well-groomed and seasoned politician who has learnt a lot in politics. Mimiko said, “We don’t expect any surprise. Agboola has seen and exercised power. He has a good head and good heart for governance. This is not the time for a campaign but I will tell my friend (Akeredolu) why he was able to do what I could not do in eight years. “Any party that does not drive in the direction of removing the burden of looking for money for reproductive health cannot be called a progressive.” In his remarks, Agboola described Mimiko as a leader of politicians who was able to manage all of them for eight years.
