Ted Odogwu, Kano AN elder statesman and co-founder of the Arewa Consultative Forum, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, on Wednesday in Kano reiterated his earlier call for a return to the parliamentary system of government, insisting that it would end the lingering allegations of marginalisation by some parts of the country. Besides, Yakasai, while commenting on a viable political option, also called for zoning of political power, even as he emphasised that zoning and prioritisation would take care of the aspirations of different groups in the country. According to him, once power goes round, at least, once or twice, the different groups will be reassured that someday, they will get hold of the opportunity to produce the next President of the country. However, Yakasai pointed out that his endorsement for zoning was not his best choice, but realised that such would lead to the stability of the country should be paramount than any other consideration. Recall that for quite some time, Yakasai, who is the former senor liaison officer to ex-President Shehu Shagari, on National Assembly Affairs, has been agitating for a return to cabinet system of government, which he said was cheaper to operate when compared with the current presidential system of government in the country.
