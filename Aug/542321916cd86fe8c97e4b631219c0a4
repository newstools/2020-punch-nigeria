Tobi Aworinde The number of active COVID-19 cases in the Federal Capital Territory has surpassed Lagos State, which hitherto was identified as the epicentre of the outbreak in the country. The COVID-19 situation report by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control for August 2 showed that Lagos had 12,915 cases, while the FCT had 2,759. However, the NCDC, in its COVID-19 Situation Report released on Thursday, stated that Abuja, which had 4,241 confirmed cases, was reported to have discharged 1,231 and recorded 45 deaths with 2,965 active cases. On the other hand, Lagos, which recorded 15,627 confirmed cases, was reported to have discharged 13,119, while 192 deaths and 2,316 active cases were recorded in the state. This indicates that Lagos recorded a 557 per cent reduction in active cases between August 2 and 6, while the FCT showed a 7.4 per cent increase. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
