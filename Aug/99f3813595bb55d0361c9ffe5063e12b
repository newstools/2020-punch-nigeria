Temiloluwa O’Peters MTN Nigeria and Unacast, a location platform and analytics firm, have partnered to use human mobility insights derived from MTN’s network data, to make available a version of Unacast’s COVID-19 Social Distancing Scoreboard in Nigeria. MTN said, in a statement issued Tuesday, that the companies would provide the easy-to-use dataset on a pro-bono basis to enable the public understand and convey the importance of social distancing in fighting the spread of COVID-19. The statement said the human mobility insights would enable African public officials and the population to make informed and proactive decisions when navigating COVID-19 across regions. And as the Nigerian economy grows, the company said the platform would also allow African decision makers access data-driven insights for urban planning and development including real estate, retail, transportation, research and more.
