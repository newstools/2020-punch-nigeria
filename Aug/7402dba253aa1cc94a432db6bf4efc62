Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja THE Federal Executive Council on Wednesday approved N8.5bn for the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. The sum is meant for the procurement of 12 items in various quantities for the testing of COVID-19. It was learnt that the approval was given at a meeting of the council presided over by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). The approval was based on a memorandum presented to the council by the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire. Ehanire disclosed the development to State House correspondents at the end of a meeting at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He explained that the approval was made to further equip the NCDC to respond appropriately to the community transmission phase of the pandemic. The minister said, “We have already made plans to have at least one sample collection centre in every local government, minimum of 774. “These resources will be necessary to go around the 774 local government areas, to ensure that persons in rural areas and small towns are not excluded and to ensure that not only the big cities are the ones that are being attended to. “That is the basis for the memo. The cost is N8.49bn to procure the items that are involved. There is a total of 12 items; the quantities involved are large numbers, which will be sent out later.” Copyright PUNCH.
