Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Minister of Defence, Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi (retd.), has said the Federal Government will soon deploy technology in the military campaigns against insecurity. The Minister of Defence gave this assurance in a remark at the graduation lecture for Course 28 participants at the National  Defence College, Abuja. The minister, represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Defence,  Sab’iu Zakari, said Nigeria as a global player “is pulling her weight among nations  of the world exploiting digital economy, security and in other areas of our national lives.” According to a statement on Tuesday by the Special Assistant, Media and Publicity, to the minister, Mohammad Abdulkadri, Magashi contextualised the nexus between security, defence and digital economy. The statement said, “It is in the light of the criminal deployment of digital sophistication  and know- how by  the non-state actors that he challenged security and defence establishments to  continue to play key role in the digital  Nigeria as typified by the National Defence College symbolic  lectures at all times.” Copyright PUNCH.
