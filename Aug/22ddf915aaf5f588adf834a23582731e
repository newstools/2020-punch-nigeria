Raphael Ede, Enugu the Spiritual Director, Adoration Ministries, Enugu, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, has reopened the ministry’s ground after being shut down for five months in compliance with the COVID-19 safety protocols. Mbaka, on Sunday, resumed his weekly Mass and ministration at the Adoration Arena following the lifting of the ban on public church programmes as faithful were re-united. Speaking during the service, Mbaka announced to the worshippers the news of a member’s miraculous staggered delivery of twin baby boys during the COVID-19 lockdown. He disclosed that the couple had tried everything while seeking a baby boy, including travelling abroad without success. In a homily themed: ‘Save Me Lord’, Mbaka warned his detractors to desist from planning evil against him and his ministry to avoid incurring divine wrath, stressing that those who had tried it in the past did not live to tell their story. He stated, “Like you know, whenever we declare prophecy here, the whole country goes gaga and they begin to plan evil. But woe betides whoever that should allow himself to be used to try any attack on me or this ministry. “You may not like me; I may not be among those you consider as good people, but I know that God is using me to save people and minister succour to mankind.” Copyright PUNCH.
