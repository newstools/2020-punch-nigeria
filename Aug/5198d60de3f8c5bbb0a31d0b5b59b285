Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri The Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Garbai Elkanemi has decried that the people of Borno State now live in fear of being attacked by terrorists. The paramount ruler made this lamentation on the heels of gun attack on Borno State governor’s convoy in Baga last Wednesday and the mortal attack on Maiduguri where six persons were officially declared killed and 27 injured on the eve of Eid-el-Kabir festival. The Shehu also called for “something urgently to be done to secure the lives and property of the people and bring back reassurance of safety to the people of the troubled state”. The Shehu made the call in Maiduguri when he paid the traditional Sallah homage on the Governor at the Government House.
