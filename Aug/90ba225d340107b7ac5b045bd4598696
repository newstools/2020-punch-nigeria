DENNIS NAKU A vigilance group known as ‘OSPAC’ has arrested two suspects allegedly involved in the murder of a youth leader, Ozuruaka Anele, in Alakahia community in the Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. Anele was shot dead in his residence by some gunmen around 2am on September 21, 2019 in the presence of his wife and three children. Operational Commander of OSPAC in Akpor, Bestman Mathew, said the suspects had been handed over to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department in Port Harcourt for further investigation. Mathew while speaking to journalists in Port Harcourt on Saturday said some persons were earlier arrested and handed over to the police, saying his men ran into the two fresh suspects while on routine duties. He stated, “They were many, but as luck would have it, we ran into one of the suspects on Thursday. He also confessed and we swung into action to get others that we were able to get.’’ The spokesman for the Rivers State Police Command, SP Nnamdi Omoni, said he heard about the arrest but had yet to get the official report. He said, “Yes, I heard it like you did but I have yet got the official report. Once I get it, I will let you know.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
