Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Former Ekiti State Governor, Mr Ayodele Fayose, said on Sunday that he had not endorsed the 2022 governorship ambition of an ex-governor, Chief Segun Oni, in the Peoples Democratic Party in the state. Fayose had on Saturday, during a PDP state congress, officially received Oni, who had earlier left the party for All Progressives Congress before returning recently. Fayose, in a tweet on Sunday, urged members of his group, the Osoko Political Family, to accord Oni with all respect, saying that “does not represent or amount to endorsement of Engr Segun Oni’s gubernatorial ambition.” He tweeted, “To my brothers and sisters in the PDP Osoko Political Family, having formally received Engr Segun Oni into the PDP at yesterday’s  (Saturday’s) State Congress, henceforth, nobody should castigate, embarrass or undermine him (Oni) on any social media platforms associated with Osoko Political Family.” Copyright PUNCH.
