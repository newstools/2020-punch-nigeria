Dele Ogunyemi, Warri Immediate past governor of Delta State, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, has denied the allegation by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, accusing him (Uduaghan) of collecting N429million road contract from the Niger Delta Development Commission. While maintaining that the allegation is false, Uduaghan also described the report as “laughable and untrue in its entirety”. Akpabio, in a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, had linked Uduaghan and Chief James Ibori, also a former governor of Delta, among others with some contracts awarded by NDDC. The Minister was quoted as saying that Uduaghan, now a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was linked to the emergency repairs of Close B, Alhaji Estate & Environs, Rumuodomaya, Port Harcourt at a cost of N429million.

Uduaghan, in a statement signed by his Media Assistant, Monoyo Edon, copies of which were made available to journalists in Warri on Monday said he had already reached out to Akpabio, his former governor colleague, “to immediately correct the report” as he had never been awarded contracts by the interventionist agency. Uduaghan, therefore, advised the public to disregard the “mischievous publication”. The statement read in part, “We want to state very clearly that the said accusation is FALSE. Dr. Uduaghan has never approached the NDDC for any contract whatsoever. It is even more ridiculous that the said contract is a road inside Port Harcourt town. “Dr. Uduaghan has drawn the attention of the Hon. Minister of the Niger Delta, Sen Godswill Akpabio to the publication and hopes he makes a correction.”
