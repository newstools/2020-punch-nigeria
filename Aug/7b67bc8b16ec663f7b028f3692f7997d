Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan TWO persons were killed in Saki, Oyo State, on Thursday as angry youths in the town engaged officers of Nigeria Customs Service in a bloody fight. Our correspondent gathered that some Customs officers chased a driver, who they claimed smuggled bags of rice into the town. The driver, whose identity could not be immediately ascertained, was said to have been shot dead in the process. The killing was said to have triggered a violent reaction from the youths of the town, who attacked the Customs office in the town and also killed an officer of the NCS during the showdown. Sources said the NCS office was set ablaze and vehicles parked there were damaged, but it was not clear if the building was completely burnt. Although nobody was said to have been killed apart from the two earlier cases, some residents, it was gathered, sustained injuries. In order to prevent further loss of lives and property, the Okere of Saki, Oba Khalid Olabisi, imposed curfew on the town starting from 7pm on Thursday. The Director of Media of the Okere Palace, Mr Akeem Olabisi, said, “Kabiyesi has imposed a curfew, which starts from 7pm. This was done to prevent the situation from degenerating.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr Olugbenga Fadeyi, said a resident was killed during a faceoff between some persons and a team of Joint Task Force, which comprised policemen, Customs officers, soldiers and others.
