Tony Okafor, Awka The Independent Petroleum Marketers of Nigeria, Anambra State Chapter, on Sunday gave the state Governor, Willie Obiano, August 25 to pay a debt of N13.6m owed to one of its members by the state government or it would shut down operations in the state. It said the debt was the cost of petroleum products supplied to the state-owned Transport Company of Anambra State since 2017 by one of its members, Siluch Oil and Gas Limited. It was gathered that IPMAN had on August 4 issued a 21-day ultimatum to the state government to pay the debt. Addressing journalists in Awka on Sunday, the Enugu IPMAN Depot Chairman, Chinedu Anayaso, said the shutdown would be total until its conditions were met. He said, “We are counting days. We have not seen anything that shows that the state government is treating our letter to them with the seriousness it deserves. “We expect that they pay the young man his money, withdraw all cases against our members for refusing to pay the levies we did not agree on, and revert to the annual unified levy we reached an agreement on.” “Our showdown will be total because IPMAN, NUPENG and Petrol Tanker Drivers are together in the plan. Any of us who will violate the decision will be fined N500, 000. “Within the period of the shutdown, no product destined for Anambra will be loaded. Other states like Enugu and Ebonyi under the zone will be affected.” Reacting, the state Commissioner for Transport, Afam Mbanefo, said he had been briefed on the debt and that he was working on it. He said, “I have looked at the transactions of this office since I assumed office and this debt amounting to N13.57m was presented and IPMAN leadership had visited me on the matter.” Copyright PUNCH.
