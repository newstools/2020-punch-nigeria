Peter Dada, Akure The African Democratic Congress on Sunday said it will not participate in the rerun of the local council poll scheduled to hold on yet to be announced date. The Ondo State Independent Electoral Commission had announced on  that the council poll held on August 22, 2020, was cancelled in some wards due to  irregularities, having declared APC winners in all 199 wards, as well as the18 local government areas in the state. According to the ODIEC, the chairmanship and counsellorship seats in the 18 local governments and 199 wards , announced were won by the ruling All Progressives Congress. The affected wards are  wards  9 and 13 in the Akoko South-West Local Government Area, Ward 1 in Ifedore LGA and Ward 6 in Akure North LGA. The state leader of the ADC,  Mr Bode Iwaloye, said  there were numerous irregularities and electoral frauds that allegedly characterised the poll, adding that the results of the would be challenged in court. Iwaloye said, “ We won’t participate in any rerun. The whole local government election held on August 22 was programmed to fail and when it was held, there was wide condemnation across the state “But we will take refuge in the ambit of law. We don’t have any gun or  weapon. This is not violence for violence; we will approach the court.” Copyright PUNCH.
