Ade Adesomoju, Abuja Justice Ahmed Mohammed of the Federal High Court in Abuja, on Thursday, ordered the transfer of one of the two suits challenging the nomination of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, in the forthcoming October 10, 2020 election in the state, to the Lagos division of the court for hearing. The suit was filed by Mrs. Olajumoke Anifowose, one of the aspirants who contested with Akeredolu and others for the APC’s governorship ticket in the July 20, 2020 primary election of the party. Thursday’s proceedings were scheduled for the hearing of Anifowose’s ex parte application for substituted service of the suit on Akeredolu. Anifowose’s lawyer, Adesina Oke, had moved the application when the judge observed that the suit, being about a primary election that took place in Akure, the Ondo State capital, ought to be filed in the Lagos Division of the Federal High Court which he said had been designated to hear all cases from the South-West zone of the country during the ongoing judges’ vacation.
