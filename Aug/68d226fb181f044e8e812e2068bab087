Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin THE fight against corruption has received another boost as the Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRasaq, praised the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for its anti-graft war. AbdulRasaq specifically said that the EFCC saved the state from losing N4bn planned to be siphoned by political appointees on the eve of his taking over of government. The governor declared his administration’s support for the agency on Wednesday when he received the management staff of the Ilorin Zonal Office of the EFCC, who paid him a courtesy visit. He said, “Your efforts have helped us to stabilise our government. I recall in May 2019, on the eve of the handing and taking over of government, when about N4bn came to the account of the state government, some corrupt government officials attempted to withdraw the money and share it. But the EFCC prevented them.” Earlier, the Zonal Head of the Ilorin Office of the EFCC, Oluwasina Oseni, said the presence of the Commission in Kwara was aimed at preventing people from committing financial crimes and also fish out the bad ones in the society. “When there is good governance, the populace will enjoy the dividends of democracy. We are here to deter people from committing economic and financial crimes in the society. “We all know that crime is inevitable in our society, but the EFCC is here to fish out the criminal elements and deal with them according to the provisions of the law,” Oseni said.
