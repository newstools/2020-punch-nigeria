Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The All Progressive Congress on Wednesday alleged that armed thugs mobilised by the Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, had occupied the venue of their rally in Jattu, Edo North Senatorial District, and scared away their supporters with gunshots. John Mayaki, the chairman of the Edo APC Media Campaign Council, accused the Deputy Governor of masterminding the attack and invasion. He alleged that the thugs were lodged in hotels by the deputy governor who preceded the “carefully-planned attack on the APC and leaders with a false petition to the police to deflect attention from himself and blame the violence on others.” He said, “Today in Jattu, he has charged the thugs to ensure that no APC rally must take place because the sheer number of residents who are planning to attend will expose his rejection to the whole world.” But Shaibu said that the latest cry of the APC was akin to the cry of a drowning man. Chief Press Secretary to the deputy governor, Musa Ebomhiana, who spoke on his behalf, said it was impossible for the deputy governor who was campaigning in the Ovia North East on the day to also be at Owan East at the same time. “”They know that this battle has been fought and won in the spiritual realm. We are only waiting for the manifestation in the physical on the 19th of September,” Shaibu said. Copyright PUNCH.
