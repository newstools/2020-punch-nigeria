Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Chairman of the PDP National Campaign Council for the Edo State Governorship Election, Governor, Nyesom Wike, has charged the Independent National Electoral Commission and Security agencies to be apolitical in the election scheduled for September 19, 2020. Wike gave the charge while speaking on a Channels Television programme, urged the electoral umpire to use the Edo election to correct its previous mistakes, saying as the giant of Africa, other countries can learn something good on how to conduct free and fair poll from Nigeria. The governor, in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, said, the success of Edo election would be largely determined by the role played by security agencies and INEC. He said “This is so because they often interfere with electoral processes, which manifests as scuttling of the will of the electorate. “I do not know if I have 100 per cent confidence in INEC for now but maybe, as the days go on, what we will see may give us hope. “Nigeria prides itself to be the giant of Africa and we go to other countries to observe elections and adjudge them as free and fair.  But we find it difficult to do same here. We must show one good thing people can learn from us.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
