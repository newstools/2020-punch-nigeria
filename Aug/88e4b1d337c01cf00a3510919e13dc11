Johnny Edward The Nigerian Football Federation is poised to appoint a new Technical Director for the federation this week, with the announcement of the head coach for the Super Falcons coming thereafter, The PUNCH has reliably gathered. Our correspondent learnt the federation would pick Bitrus Bewerang, the Technical Director’s successor, from the shortlisted candidates selected by its Technical and Development Committee and its Integrity Office. Bewerang’s contract with the NFF expired last month and was not renewed by the federation. He held the position for nine years and was assisted by Ex-international Siji Lagunju and Rafiu Yusuf. The PUNCH also learnt that the NFF would also announce a new national team coach for the Super Falcons next week. The Falcons have been without a coach for 10 months since Thomas Dennerby resigned as coach of the women’s national team last year, despite having a year left on his contract. Dennerby, whose deal was due to run until the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, cited unfulfilled contractual obligations for his exit. He led the Falcons to the 2018 African Women’s Cup of Nations title and guided them to the last 16 of the 2019 Women’s World Cup in France. In his absence, the African champions failed to qualify for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Since the departure of the 60-year-old Swede, NFF President, Amaju Pinnick, has insisted on appointing a world-class coach for the team. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
