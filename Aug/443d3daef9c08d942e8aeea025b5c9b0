Joseph Olaoluwa The 100 pilots and engineers whose contract have been declared redundant by Bristow Helicopters would have to wait till next week to know their fate as negotiations between the National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers and the Federal Ministry Labour and Employment has been extended to next Thursday. The National Vice President, National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers, Capt. Yakubu Dukas, confirmed this in an interview with our correspondent. Bristow Helicopters had on Tuesday declared about 100 pilots and engineers redundant, hinging its decision on plans to restructure the company amid the COVID-19 pandemic. But NAAPE had on Wednesday threatened to ground flight operations for two weeks should the company refuse to rescind its decision. The union on Thursday met officials of the Federal Ministry of Labour in Lagos. The meeting lasted about four hours, according to Dukas. He said, “Both parties are to return to status quo. We are to report back next week Thursday to continue the negotiation. “If both of you are returning to the negotiation table, it would be something that is favourable. The members will be happy to move out of the picketing and continue their work. “The meeting went well. We met with the Ministry of Labour to reverse the status quo. Whoever they made redundant is null and void and they would revert to status quo.” Before the declaration of redundancy, the workers had declared strike over disparity in local and expatriate remunerations. The strike has been temporarily suspended to allow for negotiation. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
