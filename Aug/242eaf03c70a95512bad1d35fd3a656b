Kelvin Ekerete New Napoli striker Victor Osimhen will be unveiled to the media alongside fellow new signing Amir Rrahmani on Wednesday (today), with manager Gennaro Gattuso heaping praises on the 21-year-old Nigerian. Gattuso said Osimhen’s arrival  would give his team a better attacking option in next season, after watching the club’s new signing in his first training on Monday during their preseason tour of the Castel di Sangro in Abruzzo, Italy. “Victor Osimhen is a player who gives us the possibility to play differently. With him we can change our style of play, he knows how to attack spaces well, he has great physical strength,” Gattuso stated on Napoli’s Twitter page. The forward joined the Italian giants on a five-year-deal for an African record of €81m, including add-ons. Osimhen made the move after his impressive debut season with Lille, where he scored 18 goals in 38 appearances across all competitions. Copyright PUNCH.
