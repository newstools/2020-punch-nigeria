Friday Olokor, Abuja The Independent National Electoral Commission on Wednesday expressed concerns over what it described as “ugly reports” of violence coming from politicians in Edo State ahead of the governorship elections scheduled for September 19. The commission said it would summon the campaign council of political parties and candidates participating in the election over the threat of violence. The INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said this during an on-the-spot assessment of its preparedness for the August 8 bye-election in Nasarawa State on Wednesday. The commission also said it was set for the bye-election. Yakubu said, “We are carefully monitoring what is happening in Edo State and also in Ondo State. The commission will be meeting tomorrow (Thursday) and given the urgency of the situation in Edo State, we may have to immediately call a meeting of not just the candidates and the political parties, but also the campaign councils. We have to stem the ugly report of violence so far or the threat of it.” The INEC chairman said the election in Nasarawa State would be historic and unique because “it will be a test run for subsequent elections in the context of the protocols of the COVID-19 pandemic.” Copyright PUNCH.
