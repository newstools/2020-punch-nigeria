Gbenga Adeniji The Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress says it has not chosen a candidate for the Lagos-East senatorial by-election. Speaking with our correspondent in a telephone interview on Saturday, the party’s Chairman, Mr Tunde Balogun, stated that primary elections fixed for Thursday would determine its standard-bearers for both the Lagos-East and Kosofe Constituency II by-elections. The senatorial seat became vacant following Senator Bayo Osinowo’s death on June 15 and the demise of Tunde Braimoh on July 10 created a vacuum in Kosofe Constituency II at the state House of Assembly. Lagos-East comprises five council areas, namely Kosofe, Ikorodu, Somolu, Ibeju-Lekki and Epe. Speculations had been rife that Mr Tokunbo Abiru, who recently stepped down as the managing director of a commercial bank, had been unanimously adopted as the party’s consensus candidate for Lagos-East. Balogun, however, noted that the banker had yet to emerge as the party’s candidate for the senatorial seat by-election but remained an aspirant until the conduct of the party’s primary election. He added, “For now, he’s the sole aspirant for the Lagos-East senatorial by-election. He’s the only one who has bought the nomination form. The party’s primary election for Lagos-East is fixed for Thursday. The primary election can be for ratification or affirmation. But for now, he is the sole aspirant of the party for the election. He’s not the party’s candidate for the election yet.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
