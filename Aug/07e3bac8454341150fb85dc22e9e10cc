Tobi Aworinde Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Thursday, opened the first indigenous medically graded face mask manufacturing company in Lagos State. Sanwo-Olu, according to a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile, described the development as timely. The factory, O-Care Medical Face Mask factory in Odofin Park Estate, Amuwo Odofin Local Government Area, is said to be a subsidiary of Transgreen Nigeria Limited, a local manufacturer of medical equipment, including respirators, ventilators, hand gloves and personal protective equipment. The O-Care face mask is reportedly the first certified medical face mask locally produced in Nigeria in line with World Health Organisation standards. Sanwo-Olu said, “I am personally excited to attend this event because Lagos is recording another first for a good cause. The establishment of the first indigenous factory producing certified medical face masks represents the can-do spirit of Nigerians.” The face mask manufacturer said it founded the factory due to the “embarrassing situation” the nation found itself in with the absence of local manufacturers of medical face masks in the country.
