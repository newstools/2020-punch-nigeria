John Charles, Makurdi A former National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Barnabas Gemade has said his return to the All Progressives Congress was out of a burning desire for good governance. Gemade was the first elected chairman of the PDP but left to join the APC in 2015, he, however, left for the Social Democratic Party in 2019 but returned to the APC last week. While speaking to journalists at his residence in Makurdi, on Thursday, Gemade said, “The fact is that you move in politics based on the interests that present themselves. When I left the PDP in 2014, it was because the party had put a framework in place to stop me from getting my second term as senator representing my senatorial zone. “And I said well. If you have arsenals flying to shoot you down and you foolishly decide to stay there to be shot, then you are not a clever person. That’s why I left APC. And I left in good time enough to win my election. And as you know, the incumbent governor of the state at that time contested against me and lost the election.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
