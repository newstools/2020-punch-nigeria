Bola Bamigbola Members of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Ijesa North Federal Constituency on Saturday threatened to embark on a protest at the PDP National Secretariat over the party’s refusal to recall the suspended Osun State chairman of the party, Mr Soji Adagunodo. A statement made available to Sunday PUNCH titled, “Ijesa North PDP threatens to stage protest against refusal to reinstate Adagunodo,” was signed by Rotimi Odugbemi, the leader of the group. The members noted that if the suspension of the chairman could not be reversed, then another loyal party member from Ijesa North Federal Constituency should be appointed to complete his tenure. The group said the silence of the national leadership of the party over the issue was becoming an embarrassment, insisting that it would soon storm the PDP national secretariat in protest, if its demand were not met. The statement read in part, “We members of the party (Ijesa North Federal Constituency) are set to stage a protest at the National Secretariat of the party in Abuja. We are demanding from the national leadership of the PDP the reinstatement of Soji Adagunodo as chairman of the party in Osun or the appointment of another competent and loyal party man from Obokun Local Government Area, where Adagunodo hails from as chairman in line with the dictate of Section 47; sub-section 6 of the PDP constitution.” “We also condemn in strong terms the attempt to choose an Acting Chairman from any other part of Ijesa land beside Obokun where Adagunodo hails from to complete his term. We shall strongly resist any undue replacement.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
