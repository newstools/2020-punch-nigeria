Emmanuel Babayaro says he rejected a chance to become a Turkish citizen after he was told he must serve in the country’s army before joining giants Besiktas, The PUNCH reports. Babayaro, a former Plateau United goalkeeper was on trial at Besiktas in 1998 when he received the offer. The Atlanta ‘96 Olympics gold medallist said he was scared serving in another country’s army, a decision he said denied him a chance at Besiktas. “I was on trial with Besiktas and the whole thing was going well until they told me that I should serve in their army,” Babayaro told The PUNCH. “Some of the guys at the club had served in the Turkish army and when they told me to get ready to serve, I told my agent I was not going to be part of it. “I decided to call it quits with Besiktas because I was scared and for a fact, I am not cut out for anything military, not to talk of serving in a foreign country’s army,” Babayaro added.
