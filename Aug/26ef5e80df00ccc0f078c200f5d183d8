Joseph Olaoluwa Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria have kicked against dock labour employers who refused to grant registered stevedores and dock workers access to the operational areas allocated to them by the Nigerian Ports Authority. In a statement issued on Tuesday signed by the president, Mr Adewale Adeyanju, the union said some stakeholders had failed to abide by an extant Federal Government marine notice issued through the Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency in 201. The statement was entitled ‘Marine Notice: Government Notice No 106 on Stevedoring Regulations, 2014. A call for compliance.’ According to Adeyanju, the union will not sit back and fold arms and watch members being disallowed to perform the statutory duties that fetch them their daily bread. He said, “We use this medium to sound a note of warning to those stakeholders who feel that they can always flaunt government directive with impunity and in effect expose our members to starvation to have a rethink and allow the government-approved and NIMASA-registered stevedores and dock workers access without let or hindrance the operational areas government allocated to them to perform their legitimate dues.” The union also urged the government to dredge the Calabar Channel so that it could create employment and improve commercial activities in the area.
