Adeyinka  Adedipe, Benin Opposition party in Edo State, the All Progressives Congress, has alleged plans by Governor Godwin Obaseki and the Peoples Democratic Party to arrest its leaders over staged kidnappings in the state. The Chairman of the media committee for the PDP campaign, John Mayaki, said, “We have been made aware of plans by the Governor Godwin Obaseki and his party, the PDP, to stage kidnappings of some of their members across the state and blame the APC for their disappearance. “We are also aware that Governor Obaseki is already mounting pressure on security agents to play along in this shameful plot. He has requested that they commence arrest of our leaders across the state and keep them in detention over the fake kidnappings just to keep them out of circulation and prevent them from continuing their grass-roots mobilisation of voters.” But the  Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Chris Nehikhare, denied the allegation. He said, “APC is always coming up with what PDP is planning. Are they in PDP to know what PDP is planning? Are they part of the plan? How did they get this information that PDP wants to stage manage kidnaps? “It is the cry of a drowning man. APC is drowning and it is coming up with all manner of narratives to fill up media spaces. Their campaign is a failure, their message is not being listened to by Edo people so they think they can cause chaos in the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
