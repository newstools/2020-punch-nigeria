Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, says plans are underway to resuscitate the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Dare said this in Ibadan while speaking with newsmen on the sidelines of his visit to the palace of the Olubadan. The minister said the Federal Government was considering a partnership arrangement with the state government or the outright concession of the stadium. He said the stadium would bounce back to life as soon as any of the options was implemented. Dare said, “I met a plan on ground; there is an approval to concession Federal Government-owned stadiums starting with Abuja and the one in Surulere, Lagos. “I agree that concession is the best option, the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium is the oldest stadium in Africa and the oldest in Nigeria. “We have another option which is to work with the Oyo State government, we can cede the stadium to them if we have a commitment that they will bring it to standard.
