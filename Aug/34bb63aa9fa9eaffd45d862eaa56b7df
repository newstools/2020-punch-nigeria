Boko Haram jihadists on horseback killed two men and seized two others when they attacked farmers outside Maiduguri city in northeast Nigeria, anti-jihadist militia told AFP Saturday. The insurgents rode into fields in Alau village on Friday, seizing four farmers, hacking two to death and kidnapping the others after inflicting machete cuts on them, the sources said. “We recovered the bodies of the two slain farmers, bearing deep machete wounds to the head and torso,” militiaman Mohammed Bukar said. “Farmers who escaped the assault said two others were injured and abducted by the attackers,” Bukar added. The farmers were from a displaced camp on the outskirts of the city who grow crops in the village, said militia leader Babakura Kolo, confirming the death toll. Around two million people have been displaced by the decade-long jihadist conflict. Many now live in camps where they rely on food and humanitarian assistance from aid agencies. Some have turned to felling trees from the surrounding bushland to sell as firewood to make money to buy extra provision while others engage in subsistence farming in nearby fields.
