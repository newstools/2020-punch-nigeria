Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Oyo State Police Command has declared a suspected serial killer wanted after he reportedly escaped from custody on August 11. Sunday Shodipe, 19, was arrested and paraded alongside two others at the Oyo State Police Command on July 17 and later charged to court. The suspect was said to have, however, escaped from police custody while still undergoing trial. In a telegraph message signed by the Police Public Relations Officer, Olugbenga Fadeyi, the command stated, “The Commissioner of Police, Oyo State Command, Nwachukwu Enwonwu, wishes to state that the prime suspect in the serial killings at Akinyele Local Government Area, Moniya, Ibadan, Sunday Shodipe, 19 years, who was arrested and paraded along with two others at the Oyo State Police Command on July 17 and later charged to court but remanded in Police custody escaped from lawful custody on August 11. “Consequent upon this, the CP wishes to implore the general public to be on the lookout, arrest and immediately inform the officers and men of the Command when sighted for immediate handing over for further action.” It urged members of the public with credible information on the whereabouts of the hoodlum not to hesitate in informing the command for his rearrest. In addition, it advised angry youths in the state against taking laws into their hands “by carrying out jungle justice when suspected criminals are arrested.” Rather than revert to self-help, the message said suspects should be handed over to the police.
