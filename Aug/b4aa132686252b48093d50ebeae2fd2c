Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The Kaduna State Police Command on Saturday arrested some protesters, who took to the streets of the sate today over what they described as “genocide” in the southern part of the state and the government’s inability to arrest the situation. The protesters were said to have paralysed activities at the Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company, a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, located in the Chikun Local Government Area of the state. The protesters comprising youths defied security operatives whose presence was said to have been intentional to intimidate them into aborting their demonstrations. The youths insisted that the federal and state governments must find a lasting solution to the killings in Southern Kaduna.
