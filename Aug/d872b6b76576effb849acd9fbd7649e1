Ade Adesomoju The Bayelsa State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja, on Saturday, affirmed Duoye Diri as the duly elected governor of the state. In separate judgments, the Justice Mohammed Sirajo-led panel of three judges unanimously affirmed the governor’s election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party in the November 19, 2019 poll. It dismissed three separate petitions filed by different parties to challenge Diri’s emergence as Bayelsa governor. The dismissed petitions were filed by the Alliance for Democracy, the United People’s Congress, the Liberation Movement, and their respective candidates. Diri, who came second in the November 16, 2020 governorship election in the state, was declared the elected governor of the state in a subsequent February 2020 Supreme Court judgment disqualifying the All Progressives Congress’ candidate, David Lyon, who earlier emerged the winner of the poll. Affirming his emergence as governor on Saturday, Justice S.M. Owoduni, who read the lead judgment of the tribunal, held that the petition filed by Owei Woniwei and his party, the AD, was incompetent and lacked merit. The judge held that the petitioners failed to prove the allegation that Diri’s deputy, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, forged his declaration of age and National Youth Service Corps discharge certificate. The tribunal also dismissed the petition filed by Ibiene Stephen and his UPC for lacking in merit and also struck out the petition filed by Vijah Opuama and his LM, which had also accused Ewhrudjakpo of forging his NYSC discharge certificate.
