Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo OSUN State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has lamented a situation where non-indigenes take federal positions meant for the state. Oyetola, who described such development as criminal, charged the leadership of the Federal Character Commission to ensure equity and fairness in the discharge of its duties. A statement by Ismail Omipidan, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, on Thursday said Oyetola spoke while receiving a delegation led by Mr. Rasaq Adeoye, a Commissioner representing Osun in the commission, in his office. Oyetola said, “We have heard instances of non-citizens taking the slots of Osun when it comes to distribution of positions. That is not fair; that is criminal. So, you need to seriously look into that, moving forward.” Speaking earlier, Adeoye lauded the state government for creating an enabling environment for all Federal government agencies operating in the state.
