Raphael Ede, Enugu The President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo, on Friday, predicted that Nigeria would witness a turnaround in its fortunes if a president of Igbo extraction emerges in 2023. Nwodo, who stated this in congratulatory message by his Media Adviser, Chief Emeka Attamah, to the newly appointed Minister of Justice and Solicitor General in Alberta, Canada, Nigerian-born Kelechi Madu, said the Igbo has all it takes to make Nigeria great and become the true giant of Africa. Madu made history on Tuesday as the first African-born provincial Minister in Canadian history, as well as the Provincial Secretary and Keeper of the Great Seal of the Province of Alberta. The Ohanaeze leader appealed to the Federal Government to stop marginalising and victimising the Igbo, so that their latent potentials could be harnessed for the good of all and the advancement of the country. According to him, Ohanaeze Ndigbo is “highly honoured” by the exploits of Madu in Canada as an Igbo son. He said, “On behalf of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, I commend the sterling qualities of Mr Kaycee Madu, as well as other Igbo sons and daughters who have excelled so much outside the country, such as the recently appointed first black Vice Chancellor of Leeds Trinity University in the UK, Prof Charles Egbu, and many others. “The exploits of Igbo sons and daughters both within and outside the country are indices of the cerebral capability and ingenuity of the people which Nigeria could exploit to advance its development.” Copyright PUNCH.
