Joseph Olaoluwa The Nigeria Labour Congress has rejected the recent sacking of 100 pilots by Air Peace, 69 Pilots by Bristow Helicopters and National Union of Air Transport Employees union executives working with Turkish Air. In a press statement signed by the NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, on Friday, he described the sacking of Air Turkish, Air Peace and Bristow Helicopters workers as “highly insensitive, callous, and unjust.” He stressed that workers should not be penalised for participating in union activities. “The unilateral sack of executive members of the National Union of Air Transport Employees working with Turkish Airline is particularly distressing. These workers were sacked for fighting for the rights of Nigerian workers in Turkish Air. READ ALSO: Gunmen kill pregnant woman, husband, two others in Bayelsa “This is very reprehensible. We wish to remind Turkish Air that unionized workers cannot be punished or sacked for participating in trade union activities. This action is aimed at frustrating unionization in Turkish Air and to enslave Nigerians working with Turkish Air,” the statement read in part. While stressing that labour would not stop advocating for the dismissed workers, Wabba asked the management of Turkish Air, Air Peace and Bristow Helicopters to reinstate all redundant workers within two weeks. “We call on the management of Turkish Air, Air Peace and Bristow Helicopters to reinstate all the sacked workers withing two weeks. As agreed between labour and Employes’ Association, social dialogue should be used to resolve industrial concerns instead of the current resort to unilateralism. “We will not hesitate to mobilize the weight of the entire Nigerian workforce to the premises of Turkish Air, Air Peace and Bristow Helicopters if our demands are not met,” the statement added.
