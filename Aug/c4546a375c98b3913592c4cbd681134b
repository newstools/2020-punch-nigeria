Ada Wodu, Calabar THE Cross River State Government on Thursday demolished houses belonging to suspected kidnappers in the Calabar Municipal Area. The houses were pulled down shortly after the suspects were paraded by the state Commissioner of Police, Abdulkadir Jimoh. The suspects are Nse Nse Otu, 31, also known as the Lion whose house is located at 31, Akim Road close to the University of Calabar, and Louis Bassey whose apartment is located along Marian Road. Bulldozers brought down the two houses as the personnel of the Anti-Kidnapping Unit of the Cross River State Police Command watched. It was learnt that the two kidnap suspects were arrested alongside four others for kidnapping Mrs Ekwele Agube, the wife of Justice Ignatius Agube and the killing one of her aides in July. Other four suspects were identified as Christopher Effa Eyo, 28; Bassey Effiong, 30; Etim Effiong, 30; and Edet Ebe, 29. Permanent Secretary in the State Security Adviser’s office, Dr Alfred Mboto, who led the demolition squad, warned that “anyone arrested for kidnapping, cultism and drug-related offences would have his property pulled down except the person lives in a family house or rented apartment.” Copyright PUNCH.
