Patrick Odey,Uyo Akwa Ibom State government has partnered with the International Monetary Fund in the training of staff of the revenue service to address the challenges faced in revenue generation in the state. The Executive Chairman of the state Internal Revenue Service, Mr Okon Okon, said the challenges of tax administration had made tax payment and tax collection a difficult exercise in the state. Speaking at the opening of a virtual 10-day Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool training programme of IMF for the AKIRS staff, Okon said the training became necessary as it would help the state to gain more experiences on how to improve its Internally Generated Revenue especially during the harsh economic realities occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.
