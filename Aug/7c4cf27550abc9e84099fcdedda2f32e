OLUFEMI OLANIYI Oyo State Deputy Governor, Mr Rauf Olaniyan, has explained the reason for the anger displayed by  Mrs Florence Ajimobi,  widow of former Governor Abiola Ajimobi,  during the burial of her husband. The deputy governor said this in Ibadan on Saturday when the leadership of the South-West Group of Online Publishers paid him a Sallah visit. Olaniyan said he knew the widow was grieving, insisting that he was not angry with her. He said he had nothing against the family, adding that the widow had called him and they had settled everything. The deputy governor’s convoy was denied entry at the residence of Ajimobi during the eight day prayer for the deceased. The widow also spoke angrily to the deputy governor when he and some governors went to condole with her at her residence. But commenting on the incident, Olaniyan stated, “I was not angry with Mrs  Ajimobi and the family. I had no premonition that something like that was going to happen. “When you are going into politics, you must not forget to put the Omoluabi ethos in your bag. In fact, you must have had it before going into politics. You must know when to give respect.

We don’t know the enormity of that grief.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
