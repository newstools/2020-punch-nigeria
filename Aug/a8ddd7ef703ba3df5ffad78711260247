Seven persons were killed and 17 wounded in ethnic clashes over land rights in Kasai, a vast region in central Democratic Republic of Congo, local officials said on Thursday. The violence erupted on Wednesday in the village of Bakua Tamba, in a dispute between the Kuba and Luba communities over where they could cultivate land, Franck Pongo, chief administrator of Mweka territory, told AFP. “Seven people were killed, 17 were injured, and there has been major property damage, mainly the burning of eight villages,” he said. The toll was confirmed by his counterpart in neighbouring Demba territory, Christophe Sakaji Matoni.
