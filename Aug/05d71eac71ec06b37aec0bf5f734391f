Adeyinka Olaseni, Benin Security was beefed up on Sunday  in Benin, the Edo State capital as the two major political parties –  the People’s Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress APC – held rallies in Benin City. Social activities were also disrupted as the PDP held it’s rally at Urokpota Hall open ground which created gridlock around Ring Road and adjourning roads, while the APC held its own at the Ekheuan Campus of the University of Benin which also created traffic problem around Ekheuan Road and adjourning streets. There was heavy presence of security personnel at both venues which are about four kilometres apart. The PDP’s rally was preceded by a carnival like march, which was organised by the Edo Voters Volunteers Assembly, a grass-roots voter mobilisation body made up of youths and women, mobilised from the 12 wards in Oredo Local Government Area of the state. Addressing the rally, Obaseki threatened to deal ruthlessly with political thugs who engage in bad behaviour or undermine law and order in any part of the State. The APC which held its rally in the Oredo Local Government Area in continuation of its campaigns across the 18 local government areas described the four year administration of Obaseki failure and urged the people to vote the party into office. Thecandidate of the APC, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, said Obaseki reduced the membership of Edo south from majority to minority as he inaugurated only three out of the ten lawmakers that represent the seven LGAs  in the district.
