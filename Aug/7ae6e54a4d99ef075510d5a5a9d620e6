Dayo Ojerinde The Lagos State Commissioner for Information, Mr Gbenga Omotosho, has said there is no big deal about the COVID-19 status of the state Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi. Omotosho said he was not aware if the Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, would go for another COVID-19 test. He said, “Apparently, he (the governor) does not see it as a direct issue of concern; this is not the first time someone who works with him will contract COVID-19. This should not be any big deal; you know there was a time we said 10 people tested positive for COVID-19 at the Lagos House in Marina, I don’t think this one will take a different process.” Omotosho, in a press statement on Monday, disclosed that Abayomi had tested positive for COVID-19. The statement read in part, “Subsequent to close contact with persons feeling unwell and testing positive for the COVID-19 infection, the Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, has tested positive for the virus. “Prof. Abayomi became aware of his status following the required testing protocol of contact tracing procedures. However, he is doing well with no symptoms. Adhering to the protocol of the home-based strategy in Lagos State, the commissioner will be isolating in his home for the next 14 days but will continue to discharge his duties both as the Deputy Incident Commander of the Incident Command System for COVID-19 and most especially, as the Commissioner for Health.” Abayomi in a tweet on his twitter handle, @ProfAkinAbayomi, said he and other members of his family were responding to treatment.
