Tobi Aworinde The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons has said Nigerians are “no longer living in denial” regarding the situation of human trafficking in the country amid increased awareness. NAPTIP’s Zonal Commander in Lagos State, Daniel Atokolo, who spoke on the sidelines of a 7km road walk in the state in commemoration of the 2020 World Day against Trafficking in Persons on Thursday, stated that, contrary to common belief, reporting on human trafficking showed an uptick. The walk, which had the theme ‘Human trafficking destroys lives, take a stand,’ was organised by a non-governmental organisation, Live Abundantly!, in collaboration with NAPTIP and the Nigeria Police Force. Atokolo said, “The situation is getting a lot better. People keep saying human trafficking cases are on the increase, but I keep telling people that the activities of NAPTIP have heightened the awareness about human trafficking, putting the issues of human trafficking on the front burner. The Founder and Executive Director, Live Abundantly!, Dr Ama Onyerinma, while speaking on factors that contribute to the proliferation of human trafficking, stated that lack of respect for human life was the most important. The event was also attended by the Commissioner of Police in Lagos, Hakeem Odumosu, who was represented by Deputy Commissioner of Police, Yetunde Alonge. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
