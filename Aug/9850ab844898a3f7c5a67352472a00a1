Ebenezer Bajela Nigerian coaches have showered encomiums on TF Tirana manager, Ndubuisi Egbo, following his winning debut in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday. The Nigerian coach made history as the first African coach to manage a team in the UEFA Champions League and he did it in style with a 2-0 away win over Georgian side, Dinamo Tbilisi. The former goalkeeper last month led the Albanian side to the league title, thus becoming the first African to win a topflight league title in Europe. Some Nigerian coaches believe Egbo’s heroics abroad has shown what they are capable of. “He’s been a good representative of Nigerian coaches abroad. If there had been a lot of negativities before now about Nigerian coaches, I think he is the positive thing that is happening to us now,” Abia Warriors coach Imama Amapakabo told The PUNCH. “Egbo has been able to tell the rest of the world that black coaches can do well if given the opportunities. I think he is a big plus for us.” Fidelis Ilechukwu, Heartland FC coach, reiterated Imama’s view. “Tirana’s victory on Wednesday means a lot to Nigerian coaches, there are times you are not valued in your own country and they don’t believe that you have something to offer. So, Egbo’s achievements show that Nigeria has some of the best coaches in the world.” National U-15 coach, Haruna Ilerika, said, “Egbo’s UCL victory is a morale booster for African coaches, especially Nigerian coaches. It will give us the confidence that anywhere in the world, we can ply our trades and be successful.” Former Tanzania coach, Emmanuel Amuneke, said, “I think this will convince people all over the world that a black man can also add something to the game.” Copyright PUNCH.
