The bloodshed in Idanre has to stop and if my withdrawal is the needed sacrifice to put a stop to the violence, so be it. “The 1983 incidence must be avoided completely. In the interest of restoration of peace to Idanre and to prevent further bloodshed in our dear town, I have completely withdrawn from the entire process of the local government election in Idanre and Ondo State at large. “However, any member of SDP in the State that may still wish to continue with the election is free to do so; but it should be noted that my withdrawal from the process is irreversibly final.
The lives and properties of my constituents are worth more than any victory.”
