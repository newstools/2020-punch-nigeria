The command said the boy had trekked from Nnewi to Awka, a distance of around 39 kilometres, before he was intercepted by police personnel on duty at the UNIZIK junction in Awka. A statement by the Police Public Relations Officer, Haruna Mohammed, said the boy, whose name was given simply as Gabriel, was picked up in Awka by a police patrol team. “On Wednesday, August 12, 2020, around 6.30pm, a police patrol team attached to the 29 PMF, Awka, while on patrol along the UNIZIK junction, found a male child of about 11 years old, who gave his name as Gabriel.
