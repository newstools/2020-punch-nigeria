Joseph Olaoluwa the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority has granted air traffic controllers the authority to temporarily close the airspace whenever harsh atmospheric conditions are forecast by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency. This is according to a weather advisory circular issued by the NCAA Director-General/Chief Executive Officer, Capt. Musa Nuhu, who demanded strict compliance from stakeholders. Drawing on the back of statistics released by the NIMET, the NCAA observed that most of the airports had recorded a number of thunderstorms between March and July. In the month of July, NIMET data indicated the following number of thunderstorm occurrence: Abuja (23), Ikeja (8), Kano (24), Port Harcourt (11), Owerri (17) and Benin (11).

The NCAA, which expressed worry regarding the safety of flight operations during rainy seasons and adverse weather conditions, directed all stakeholders to perform their roles as contained in the circular. The circular read in part, “By this circular: Air Traffic controllers may temporarily close airspace when hazardous weather conditions such as severe thunderstorms, squall lines, microburst or low-level wind-shear are observed or forecast by NIMET. “Flight crews/operators and air traffic controllers shall ensure adherence to aerodrome weather minima; pilots shall exercise maximum restraint whenever adverse weather is observed or forecast by NIMET.” It added that pilot and flight crew members should obtain adequate departure, en-route and destination weather information and briefing from NIMET aerodrome meteorological offices prior to flight operations.
