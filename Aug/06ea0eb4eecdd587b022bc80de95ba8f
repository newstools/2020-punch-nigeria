Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Ten states of the federation lack functional investment promotion agencies, the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission said on Thursday. According to the commission, this came to the limelight following a survey conducted by NIPC on the states. The Executive Secretary of NIPC, Yewande Sadiku, disclosed this during a webinar organised by the commission in Abuja. Providing further details from the survey, she said 26 states, representing 72 per cent, had functional IPAs. Sadiku noted that six states, representing 17 per cent, had their IPAs’ functions situated within a ministry, while four states, representing 11 per cent, just had theirs in government. The NIPC boss urged state governments to set up functional investment promotion agencies in order to attract both local and Foreign Direct Investments to their domains. This, Sadiku said, would afford the NIPC a scientific basis that could be used to enhance its working relationship with states and provide the necessary support to subnational investment promotion mechanisms. “In reality and according to our records, existing structured State Investment Promotion Agencies are not up to 26 but we continue to encourage the state governments to set up these agencies backed by legal instruments,” she said. The NIPC survey further showed sectors that had the highest investment attraction in states. The sectors include agriculture, manufacturing, education, solid minerals development and construction or real estate. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
