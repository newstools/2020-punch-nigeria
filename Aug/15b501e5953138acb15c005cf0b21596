Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State Government has bowed to the pressure from parents of students in private secondary schools, saying the COVID-19 test is free for all students. The government had charged N25,000 for COVID-19 test on each students in boarding houses in private secondary schools in the state. However, Governor Dapo Abiodun, in a statement on Monday, directed all government laboratories to carry out the test free of charge for all students. The governor, who explained the rationale behind the charge of N25,000, said, “After reviewing these developments, I have today directed that the government laboratories carry out test for all returning SS3 boarding students at no cost. I have also directed that all those who have paid for the test be refunded.” Abiodun also announced the stepping down of COVID-19 test as a mandatory requirement for returning students in the exit classes. He said, “The health of our children remains our utmost priority, however, in view of the total number of boarding students to be tested (5,340 private and 500 public), and bearing in mind the limitation of our installed testing capacity of 500 tests per day, it may not be feasible for all boarding students to get tested and get their results prior to resumption or even exams, which commence on August 17, 2020. “Consequently, the state government has therefore stepped down the COVID-19 test as a mandatory requirement for returning students in our exit classes. We therefore enjoin private school owners to exercise their duty of care to their pupils.” Parents of students in private schools in the state had on Sunday kicked against the N25,000 COVID-19 test fee.
