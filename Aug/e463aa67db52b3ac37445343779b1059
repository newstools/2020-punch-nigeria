Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Transmission Company of Nigeria on Monday announced that it had created two new work centres, one each in Katsina and Jalingo under TCN’s Kaduna and Bauchi regions respectively. It said the work centres were created to further decentralise its services to improve the company’s operational efficiency and ensure more proactive solutions to interface issues within the Kaduna and Yola Distribution companies’ franchise areas. The General Manager, Public Affairs, TCN, Ndidi Mbah, said the new Katsina Work Centre had three transmission substations. “The work centre equally has a proposed 2x60MVA 132/33kV transmission substation at Mashi LGA, which is yet to commence. Katsina Work Centre receives supply through the Kano 132kV lines 1 and 11,” she stated. The TCN officials said the new Jalingo Work Centre in Taraba State, on the other hand, receives supply through the Yola sub-region transmission substation at 132kV level. Copyright PUNCH.
