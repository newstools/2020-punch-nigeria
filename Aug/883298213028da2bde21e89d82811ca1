Johnny Edward Former Wolfsburg manager Bruno Labbadia has labelled Victor Osimhen a classic No.9 due to his work rate and effort. Labbadia, who handed Osimhen his Bundesliga debut at Wolfsburg, is confident the attacker can work well alongside current Partenopei frontman Dries Mertens. “They (Osimhen and Mertens) can coexist, they have different and complementary characteristics,” Labbadia told Italian website Il Mattino. “When he (Osimhen) has the ball on his feet, he is formidable and in one on one, he is very strong. “Then he is very good at running without the ball to be found free by his companions. “He knows how to descend in every reality, he always gives 200 per cent. “He makes a great central striker because he is the classic No.9. “Not only that, he played outside for me in 4-2-3-1. He was young and fast, but it is in front of goal that he can make the difference because he has a great flair for goal.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
