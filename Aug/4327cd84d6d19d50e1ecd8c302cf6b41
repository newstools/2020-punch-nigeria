Sunday Aborisade, Abuja A former governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress in Zamfara State, Senator Kabiru Marafa, has said that a former governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari initiated the lawsuit that led to the APC losing out in the state during the 2019 general elections. Marafa said this in an interview with journalists in Abuja, on Tuesday. The APC had won the governorship, the three senatorial and seven House of Representatives elections in the state in 2019 but a Supreme Court Judgment nullified its victory on the grounds that the candidates were not validly nominated. Marafa, said, “With due respect to him (Yari), he was the aggressor. He was the one that wanted to retire me. I only fought back. “Yari was the one that went to court, not Marafa. He conducted primaries by himself as against the committee that was sent from Abuja to conduct the exercise. “After conducting primaries, INEC told him that he didn’t have powers under our laws to conduct it because the committee that was sent to conduct the primary said they didn’t do primaries. “He (Yari) went to lower court to compel the party to forward names of his candidates to INEC. “He won. I protested by appealing the judgement. The three judges unanimously queried the lower court for even attempting to consider what they did, and threw that thing out. “Now again, Yari appealed to the Supreme Court. You can see? I did one, he started, and he did two altogether.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
