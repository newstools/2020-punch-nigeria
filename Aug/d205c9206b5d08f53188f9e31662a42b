John Alechenu, Abuja The Senator Kabiru Marafa-led faction of the Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has urged the national leadership of the party to set up a caretaker committee to oversee the affairs of the party in the state. Publicity Secretary of the group, Mohammed Bello, made the request on behalf of other members while speaking to journalists, in Abuja, on Thursday. The group was at the APC National Secretariat, Abuja, to submit a copy of a recent Gusau High Court judgment to the National Secretariat. Members of the faction also demanded that those responsible for the embarrassing judicial  loss suffered by the APC in Zamfara after the 2019 general elections must be punished. Bello, said “We are here now to call on the caretaker committee of this great party under the leadership of His Excellency Mai Mala Buni to look inward and use his wisdom as a former secretary of this party and now an executive member of the NEC to dig deep and get to the root cause, to know who is at fault on this issue. And not only that, in fact, we are calling on them to make sure they punish whoever caused all these losses in Zamfara state. “Already. the damage has been done. It is the court judgement that we brought to the national secretariat just for them to know that there is no APC leadership in Zamfara State and measures have to be taken to save the party.”
