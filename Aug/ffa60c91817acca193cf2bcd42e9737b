Enyioha Opara ,  Minna FEW days to the congress of the Niger State chapter of Peoples Democratic Party, crisis  has already engulfed the party, spitting it into two factions. It was gathered that the division in the party was caused by the decision of the national secretariat of the party to reopen the sale and submission of nomination forms for party offices. A group within the party favoured the reopening of the sale of the forms, while the other group believed such action had been overtaken by event going by the constitution of the party A former deputy governor in the state, Dr Zagbayi Nuhu, who served as spokesman for the Patriotic PDP members in the state, told journalists in Minna on Wednesday that it was unconstitutional for sales of nomination forms to recommence after the exercise lapsed four months ago and  therefore asked the national secretariat to  look into the matter before it turns bad. He also told the national Secretariat not to shift the congress for “whatever reason as the state is set to elect its officials.” In a swift reaction, the Chairman of the state caretaker committee, Garba Ciza, said the reopening of sale of nomination forms was a decision taken by the national secretariat of the party, adding that the exercise affected most states of the federation. “The national body of our party okayed the extension of the sales of the form to allow for wide inclusion of all interested persons especially all those who were screened out of the exercise,” Ciza declared.
