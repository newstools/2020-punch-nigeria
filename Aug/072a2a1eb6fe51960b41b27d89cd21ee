Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Chairman of the National Assembly Service Commission, Ahmed Amshi, has appealed to the executive arm of government to increase the annual budget of the federal parliament. Amshi said the yearly appropriated sum of N125bn was not enough to fund the nation’s apex legislative institution. He stated this on Tuesday in Abuja when he received the Chairman of the Benue State House of Assembly Commission, Dr Sylvester Atachin. “The National Assembly’s budget is not enough and we seek an increase to enable us achieve more and ensure stability in the legislative arm of government,” Amshi said. He noted that state Houses of Assembly commissions should, as a matter of necessity, separate themselves from the control of the executive in the states. He insisted that a situation where the executive takes charge of hiring and firing of aides to legislators was not acceptable as it was against the principle of separation of powers. Atachin told Amshi that the visit was to rub minds with the NASC on a number of issues, which could be of benefit to the state Assembly commission. Copyright PUNCH.
