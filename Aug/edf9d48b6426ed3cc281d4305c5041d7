Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Two students of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, studying at the College of Education, Ikere Ekiti campus, were on Sunday crushed to death by a truck at Ikere Ekiti in Ekiti State. Sources said the deceased, Hezekiah Ojo, 25, and Ayomide Ojo, 21, were on their way to Akure, the Ondo State capital, on a motorcycle when the accident occurred. A source said the incident enraged residents of Ikere Ekiti and youths, who attempted to set the truck ablaze, adding that it took the intervention of some influential individuals to stop them. He said, “The two students were on a motorcycle and were going to Akure when their okada collided with a truck and they died on the spot. “The victims had gone to buy fuel at a petrol filling station. When they left the station and joined the road, a truck on high speed rammed into them and the two died on the spot.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Sunday Abutu, confirmed the incident and said the victims were killed by a moving truck. Abutu, who said the corpses had been deposited in the morgue, added that the driver of the truck was arrested and being detained by the police. “It is sad and unfortunate that two young men could be killed due to an avoidable accident. Preliminary investigation revealed that it was a case of collision. We appeal to motorists and other road users to always exercise restraint on the roads,” the PPRO stated. Copyright PUNCH.
