Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Imo State House of Assembly has denied rumours that its mace was used to inaugurate the pro-Adams Oshiomhole lawmakers in Edo State. The Chairman, Imo House of Assembly Committee on Information and Judiciary, Dominic Ezerioha, said the legislature’s mace did not travel to Edo State. He exonerated the House from the political upheaval in Edo State. Ezerioha said the mace of the Assembly was intact and in sacred custody. He stated, “The story that the mace of the Imo State House of Assembly was taken to Edo State is a false story. It is a rumour; a fabrication of evil discussants and from evil persons, who want to destroy the Imo State Government.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
