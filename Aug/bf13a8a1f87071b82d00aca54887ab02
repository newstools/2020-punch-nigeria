Adegoke gave the names of those released on Thursday as; Samuel Olowolafe, Gift Erupke, and Martins Jesuloni. Adegoke said, “All of them have been released including Olawale Bakare. Others were released to their parents or guardians. “But I stood for Bakare because his parents died a long time ago. I read the bail bond and the main condition given was that the Bakare should not cause any trouble or act against public peace. “Apart from the three of them that were released last Thursday, others in the custody of DSS have been released too.”
