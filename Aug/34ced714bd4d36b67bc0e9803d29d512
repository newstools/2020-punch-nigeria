Samson Foarin The Lagos State Government on Wednesday trained religious leaders in the state in health and safety measures. The programme, according to a statement, was put together by the Lagos State Safety Commission in conjunction with the Ministry of Home Affairs at Alausa, Ikeja. The Director General of the LSSC, Lanre Mojola, said the training was organised as a result of the reopening of religious centres. He noted that it was a difficult time for people all over the world as countries across the globe were struggling to keep the coronavirus under control while balancing public health and economic concerns. “I hope in years to come, we will all look back and be able to take pride in how we have collectively responded to this challenge, while I do hope our children yet unborn will say political and religious leaders of this generation did a great job as regards the handling of this pandemic,” Mojola added.
