Wale Oyewale, Ibadan THE Oyo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has accused the Peoples Democratic Party of hijacking the ongoing Federal Government recruitment of 774,000 Nigerians across all local government areas. The APC claimed that the state PDP-led administration took undue advantage of the exercise held on Thursday and Friday last week. This was contained in a statement signed by the state APC Assistant Publicity Secretary, Ayobami Adejumo, in Ibadan, on Tuesday. Adejumo said, “A whopping sum of N50 billion has been allocated for the Special Public Works programme in the 2020 budget. It is aimed at employing 774,000 citizens, a thousand from each of the local government councils in the country. “In the case of Oyo State, it was expected that 33,000 residents would be considered to benefit from the scheme. “The whole exercise was disrupted by members of the ruling PDP, who hijacked the project, which was meant to be a social intervention programme, designed for the overall benefit of the teeming masses.” However, the state PDP Publicity Secretary, Akeem Olatunji, said, “The APC should substantiate their claim. It is a Federal Government project and they are the ones in charge. “What have we got to do with the programme? How can we be accused of hijacking it? They are the ones that appointed the coordinator. We believe that the exercise is meant for the poor masses. Our members are not showing interest.” Copyright PUNCH.
