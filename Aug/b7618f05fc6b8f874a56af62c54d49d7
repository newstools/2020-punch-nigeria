Olaleye Aluko THE Christian Association of Nigeria has declared Sunday, August 23, as a day of national prayer for the country to seek divine intervention concerning the spate of insecurity and violence across the states. CAN said this on Thursday in a statement by its General Secretary, Daramola Bade, titled, ‘Insecurity: CAN declares August 23 as a Day for Collective Prayers for Nigeria’. The Christian body noted that all churches in the country were expected to comply with the nationwide directive. Bade said, “Calvary greetings to you in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Please, be informed that there will be a collective prayer session, at least 15 minutes, for Nigeria on August 23, to tell God in one accord to have His way and do His will in Nigeria. “This is borne out of the insecurity in Nigeria. All churches in Nigeria are to adhere to full compliance of this prayer. Thank you and God bless.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
