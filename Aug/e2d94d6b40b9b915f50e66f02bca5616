Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has called on investors to bid for the repairs of pipelines and depots across the country. It made the call through its bid and tender notice published on its website on Wednesday. Most of Nigeria’s pipelines were built about 40 years ago. The assets move crude oil to the country’s refineries in Port Harcourt, Kaduna and Warri. The pipelines are also used to move refined products to depots for onward distribution to final consumers. The corporation observed that the seamless movement of products through these pipelines had not been the case due to continuous theft and vandalism as well as ageing. Copyright PUNCH.
