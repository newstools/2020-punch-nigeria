PATRICK ODEY The Akwa Ibom State Government has rejected the National Bureau of Statistics report which listed the state as having the second-highest unemployment rate in the country. The state government, in a statement on Saturday by its Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Ini Ememobong, said the NBS statistics was unacceptable and would be subjected to scrutiny, adding that the reality on the ground did not reflect in the NBS report. Ememobong said the state government would engage the NBS to ascertain the veracity of its processes and results while seeking answers to the sample size and population figure used in obtaining the percentage it recorded for the state. The statement read in part, “The attention of Akwa Ibom State Government has been drawn to the ‘Labor Force Statistics: Unemployment and Underemployment Report’ by the National Bureau of Statistics, wherein it listed Akwa Ibom State as the state with the second-highest unemployment rate in the country. This conclusion, which calls for serious scrutiny, is unbelievable. “The reality on the ground in our state is in contradistinction to the bureau’s report. A juxtaposition of the said report with the reality of the existence and operation of the numerous industries in our state, the recruitment into the civil and public service, Public-Private Partnership initiatives, the award of direct labour contracts, our airline and general aviation businesses, qualitative cash support and interest-free loans to entrepreneurs, financial and input support to farmers, confirm that indeed the current administration has created quality jobs in an unprecedented manner.” Copyright PUNCH.
