Adeyinka Olaseni, Benin The All Progressives Congress in Edo State has debunked allegations that it plans to attack the convoy of the state Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu. During a press conference at the APC secretariat in Benin on Tuesday, the state Chairman of the APC, Col. David Imuse (Retd), said, “It has been shown that the Edo State Government, in connivance with a retired police officer from Kogi State, who has been identified in a series of violent plots in Edo State and beyond, Mr.Yusuf Aruna, is plotting to stage an attack on their own convoy, specifically that of the Deputy Governor, Mr Philip Shaibu, in a bid to draw sympathy, pose as victims, and set the stage for a new wave of violent onslaught on the people of Edo State.” Aruna, however, denied knowledge of any plan to attack the deputy governor, adding that the allegation was new to him and disassociated himself from political violence. “I don’t know what he is talking about. I am just hearing it for the first time. I am not a thug and I don’t know thugs. You should ask Imuse to prove his case beyond doubt. People should not just make political statements, go home and sleep. I don’t know what he is talking about and in fact, it does not make any sense,” Aruna added. The deputy governor, who responded through his Senior Special Assistant to Media, Benjamin Atu, said, “All they have said in their press conference are all heaps of rubbish; any serious and responsible person should see them as such.” Copyright PUNCH.
