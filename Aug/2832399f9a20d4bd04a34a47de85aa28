Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party and its All Progressives Congress counterpart have disagreed over the results of an opinion poll allegedly conducted by the latter. The state Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Chris Nehikhare, at a press conference in Benin, on Sunday claimed that an opinion poll conducted by the opposition APC gave victory to the PDP candidate and incumbent governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki. Nehikhare said, “I can tell you that the APC conducted an opinion poll which showed that Obaseki will win the forthcoming election. The governor has done well and the people are aware of that and that is what the result of the poll conducted by the other party has shown.” In response, the Chairman, Edo State Media Campaign Council of the APC, John Mayaki, debunked the claim noting that the APC didn’t have the funds to conduct any such polls. Mayaki said “As I speak to you, we are at the campaign ground telling the electorate what we intend to do when our candidate is elected. “We have not conducted or sponsored any poll and I must tell you that we don’t have money for that. What we are doing is to let the people know how beneficial our SIMPLE agenda-based manifest will be.” The APC chieftain urged the PDP to campaign on issues instead of making frivolous and unsubstantiated claims.
