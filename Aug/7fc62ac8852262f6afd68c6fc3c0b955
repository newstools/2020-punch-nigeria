Former India Test opener Chetan Chauhan, who forged a prolific opening partnership with Sunil Gavaskar, has died aged 73 from coronavirus, his brother told AFP Sunday. Chauhan, who tested positive last month, was put on ventilator support at a hospital in Gurgaon, but his condition worsened after he suffered multiple organ failure. He is one of the highest-profile figures to die from the disease in India, which is the world’s third-most infected nation with more than 2.5 million cases and almost 50,000 deaths.

After playing 40 Tests for India, Chauhan switched to politics and was a minister in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh as a member of the ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Born July 21, 1947, the right-hander scored 2,084 runs and shared 10-century partnerships with his more illustrious teammate Gavaskar. He failed to score a Test century, with 97 his highest-ever innings. In 179 first-class matches, he accumulated 11,143 runs, earning a reputation for his solid defense and doggedness. (AFP)
