Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, has urged the National Executive Council of the All Progressives Congress, to extend the tenure of the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC Caretaker Committee to March 2021. Kalu said this in a statement by his media aide, Kunle Oyewumi, on Monday. The statement read in part, “It is with deep patriotic concerns and the future growth of our great party that I am appealing to the National Executive Council to consider extending the tenure of Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC Caretaker Committee to March 2021 against the December proposed period. “This is to give the caretaker committee members the needed time to put things in order and hand over properly to a new leadership in the end. “I don’t see any need for a fire brigade approach for them to hand over to a new leadership by December.” Copyright PUNCH.
