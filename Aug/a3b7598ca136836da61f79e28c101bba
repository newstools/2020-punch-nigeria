Spanish side Atletico Madrid on Sunday reported two positive coronavirus tests, just four days before they face Leipzig in Portugal for a place in the Champions League semi-finals. “On Saturday, all members of the first team and the club’s party to Lisbon underwent tests as required by UEFA protocols to participate in the quarter-finals of the Champions League,” said a club statement. “Among the results known today, two positives have appeared and they are self-isolating in their respective homes.” It was not revealed whether the two positive cases involved players or backroom staff. Atletico said UEFA as well as the Spanish and Portuguese football and health authorities have been informed and that a fresh round of tests will be carried out on the squad and support team. They admitted this could mean last-minute changes to travel schedules as well as accommodation plans in the Portuguese capital. “The club will coordinate the new schedules with UEFA and as soon as there is a new plan it will be made public,” added the statement. “We also request the utmost respect over the identity of the two positive cases.” The team were due to travel to Portugal on Monday for the closing stages of the Champions League which is being held in Lisbon as a precaution against COVID-19 rather than risk having teams travelling across Europe for home-and-away ties. The self-contained eight-team tournament will be staged behind closed doors, starting on Wednesday with the final set for Lisbon on August 23. AFP
