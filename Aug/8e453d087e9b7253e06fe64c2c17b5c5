Johnny Edward Anthony Nwakaeme has distanced himself from talks of a move away from Trabzonspor this summer, The PUNCH reports. Nwakaeme, who has two years left on his current deal at the club, has been strongly linked with a move to Fenerbahce, with reports in Turkey claiming he has agreed personal terms with the Yellow Canaries. “I have heard many things that have been said in the media. I’m still a player of Trabzonspor, my goal isn’t to leave at the moment,” Nwakaeme told The PUNCH. “I have two years left on my contract and if I have to leave, there must be an offer officially made to the club.” Our correspondent gathered that Trabzonspor would listen to offers for the Nigerian if interested clubs tabled €6m. The 31-year-old, who joined Trabzonspor from Hapoel Beer Sheva in 2018 for €1.1m, scored 14 goals and made 11 assists in 43 games last season. Copyright PUNCH.
