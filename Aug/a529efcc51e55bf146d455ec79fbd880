Peter Dada, Akure Medical doctors in Ondo State, under the auspices of the National Association of Government General Medical and Dental Practitioners, have suspended their industrial action. The doctors embarked upon the strike action in June following the inability of the state government to accede to their demands, mostly bothering on their welfare packages. In a statement issued on Monday by the state chairman of NAGGMDP, Dr. Oluwafemi Aina, the strike was suspended after the government acceded to some of the demands of the association. The chairman however implored the state government to address some of the other demands of the association.

Aina said the government should ensure “the payment of the remaining Special COVID-19 Hazard and Risk Allowances to members and the payment of Arrears of the Minimum Wage and Consequential Adjustments of Basic Salaries which the other Non-Health Public Servants in the state have been enjoying since January 2020.” He expressed assurance that members of the association would continue to discharge their duties diligently with great passion.
