Peter Dada, Akure The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party for the October 10, governorship election in Ondo State, Eyitayo Jegede, on Wednesday said it took divine intervention for him to pick his running mate, Gboluga Ikengboju. Jegede announced Ikengboju, who is the member of the House of Representatives, representing Okitipupa/Irele Federal Constituency, as his running mate, via his Twitter handle on Monday. However, some members of the party expressed reservations about the choice. The candidate who spoke in Ondo West Local Government Area of the state during the inauguration of an independent campaign support group known as ‘Aiye Dera Independent Support Group’, said Ikengboju was a perfect running mate for him to go for the election. He said “Prayers and God’s guidance made the choice possible, my combination with him (Ikengboju) is a perfect match.” The Coordinator of the support group, Mr. Ayokanmi Edu, who also spoke at the event said “We believe in the aspiration of Eyitayo Jegede. We organise a structure of campaign with 466 volunteers from across the 18 local governments. They will move from house to house telling the people why they should vote for the PDP.” Copyright PUNCH.
