Kayode Oyero President of the LoveWorld Incorporated, aka Christ Embassy, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, says pastors who are yet to reopen their churches for physical services after the lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic were never believers. The Federal Government had, in March, ordered the closure of all public places, including worship centres across the country, as part of measures to curb the spread of the virus. The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 later allowed the reopening of worship centres in June, but some states in the South-West region, among others, did not permit the reopening of churches and mosques till August. However, some pastors have announced that their churches won’t reopen because it is still not safe to do so.
