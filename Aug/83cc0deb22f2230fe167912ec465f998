A non-profit organisation, Anap Foundation promoted by Atedo Peterside, has demanded for the reopening of the economy, saying that it believes sub-Saharan Africa will be spared from the worst possible outcomes of COVID-19. In its 6-page paper titled ‘As Nigeria enters a new (Second) and defining phase of its COVID-19 response’, it asked the government to urgently reopen the economy as the six per cent decline in the nation’s Gross Domestic Product exposed the fragility of the economy and its inability to cope with disruptive lockdowns and needless curfews. It, however, asked the government to apply innovative behaviour change communication strategies to overcome widespread myths and misconceptions among the citizens. Part of these strategies, it said, included empowering COVID-19 survivors, local channels like town criers, the civil society, and community leaders in villages to enlighten the public who no longer care about the virus spread. As part of its final recommendations, the group advised the government to reopen schools and resume both local and international flight operations. Copyright PUNCH.
