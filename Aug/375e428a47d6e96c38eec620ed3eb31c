Ebenezer Bajela manchester United fans have urged manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, to start striker Odion Ighalo against LASK in the Europa League. United will welcome the Austrian side to Old Trafford on Wednesday for the second leg of the Europa League Round of 16 ties, following a 5-0 away win in the first leg. Ighalo scored a stunner in the 28th minute to open the goals for what would turn out to be a big win for the Red Devils. Solskjaer favours a front-three of Mason Greenwood, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, who are currently the club’s top-scoring trio so far this season with 56 goals, but fans told The PUNCH they want Ighalo to make the starting 11 due to his impressive goal ratio in cup competitions. A Manchester United fan, Kunle Oluwatosin said, “Ighalo has been fantastic for us in the competition. I know he’ll definitely start against LASK in the second leg. But as the competition gets difficult, I don’t know if he’d be able to cope physically but I definitely think he should get more minutes.” Seun Popoola said, “I think starting Ighalo is subject to the strategy adopted by the coach because recently United prefer the counter-attack style and Ighalo is not so fast. But if the coach chooses to use another attacking strategy, he should be the most preferred considering his conversion rate and positioning during attack.” Alan Ihene, another United fan, added, “Solskjaer is so unpredictable and you can’t tell who he will picked but I think a front-three of Martial, Rashford and Ighalo would be the best.” Ethan Ayomikun said, “It’s not because Ighalo is a Nigerian, but I think he should be given the nod to start in the second leg of their Europa league game against LASK.” Copyright PUNCH.
