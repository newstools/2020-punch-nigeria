Johnny Edward Victor Osimhen scored a hat-trick on his first appearance in a Napoli shirt as the Partenopei recorded an 11-0 friendly win over L’Aquila on Friday. Napoli officially began their pre-season preparations with a mini-tournament against Castel di Sangro, who were outclassed. In the second game, manager Gennaro Gattuso deployed a 4-2-3-1 formation with Hirving Lozano, Dries Mertens and Lorenzo Insigne fanning out behind summer signing Osimhen. The Nigerian got off to a good start, as he sprinted past defenders to score within 59 seconds. He grabbed his second goal in the third minute before completing his hat-trick in the eighth minute. Osimhen showed precisely what Gattuso had meant when he said the striker wasn’t just a target man, as the former Lille forward also contributed two assists and sparked several other moves with his passes. A Faouzi Ghoulam header, Insigne hat-trick, plus braces for Lozano and Mertens completed the rout. Copyright PUNCH.
