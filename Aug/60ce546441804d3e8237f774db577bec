Temiloluwa O’Peters Daar Communications Plc has recorded an 11 per cent increase in its 2019 operating result, narrowing the loss suffered in 2018 by 36 per cent. The Chairman of the Group, Raymond Dokpesi Jnr, disclosed this at the group’s virtual 12th yearly meeting held at its headquarters in Abuja on Monday. He said the company recorded gross earnings of N5.15bn in 2019 as against 2018’s earnings of N4.63bn, representing an 11 per cent improvement in earnings. Dokpesi, however, stated that the company recorded a loss after taxation of N1.37bn in 2019, compared to N2.17bn recorded in 2018, representing a decrease of 36 per cent. He apologised to shareholders for not returning the company to profitability as promised in 2019, blaming the cause on the impact of the harsh economic condition last year and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Daar Group chairman reassured shareholders of a brighter future going forward, telling them that mechanisms were in place to actualise a return to profitability project. Copyright PUNCH.
