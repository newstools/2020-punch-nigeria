Temiloluwa O’Peters A non-governmental organisation, Unubiko Foundation, has said it will select 20 youths across Abia State for its annual youth empowerment programme. In a statement issued by the foundation on Monday, the Project Director, Benjamin Isani, described the programme tagged #CodeCamp, as an online digital and leadership skills masterclass that teaches specific coding languages. He said come August 10, the selected applicants would receive laptops to begin the training, and afterwards start their own businesses. The foundation noted that it had become necessary to accelerate the shift towards digitally-focused empowerment of youths in Abia State due to rising insecurity, youth unemployment and the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Isani said, “It is imperative for our young people in Abia to get the opportunity to immerse themselves in relevant leadership and digital skills critical for them to effectively compete and survive in today’s hi-tech economy. “We aim to re-channel the negative vibes that some of our youths invest in unproductive ventures to something useful by starting to build enduring products and solutions that will power Africa with tech-innovation.” Copyright PUNCH.
