All the defendants pleaded guilty to the charges. The defence counsel, Najite Okobe, urged the court to caution and discharge them. The Magistrate, Mr Adebayo Ajala, convicted the 56 defendants and sentenced 53 of them to two hours of community service without an option of fine. Ajala also sentenced Ajewole, who was arraigned for assault, to extra two hours of community service or an option of N2,000 fine.
