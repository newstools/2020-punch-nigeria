In a series of tweets via her verified Twitter handle, @aishambuhari, she wrote, “I want to use this opportunity to thank all Nigerians for their prayers and well-wishes while I was away for medical treatment. I am well now and fully recovered and have since returned back home, Nigeria. “On our way back, the Nigerian Air Force flight encountered violent clear air turbulence which was navigated safely and professionally by the captain and crew of the flight.
