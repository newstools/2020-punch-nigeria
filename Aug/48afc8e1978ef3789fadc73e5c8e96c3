Ebenezer Bajela William D’Avila, Victor Osimhen’s agent, has revealed that club president De Laurentiis and the manager Genaro Gattuso played a key role in his client’s decision to join Napoli ahead of other suitors. Napoli announced the signing of Osimhen last Friday and his agent, who appeared on Radio Kiss Kiss, a Naples-based radio station, said the assurance from the De Laurentiis convinced the Nigeria international that joining the Serie A outfit was the best decision. He said, “It was a long decision. We took the time to evaluate well, reflect and make the right decision. And the right decision in the end was to choose Naples, he is sure of it and I too. “There were clubs in Germany and England. But the most important thing was the final decision, the right one, Napoli. And today he is happy, like everyone else, for this choice. “He is a natural goalscorer, a true striker. These type of Serie A players are usually very successful. He is a footballer who attacks space, works a lot on the pitch, also helps in the defensive phase. He is a complete player and Gattuso will be able to improve him. “De Laurentiis, Giuntoli and Gattuso have been very important. Each of them spoke to Victor and each of them is a part of the reason he chose Napoli, he spoke individually to all of them. De Laurentiis told him what is expected of him and immediately put him at ease with regards to the project. Giuntoli was the key man, he worked hard, non-stop calls to convince the player. He also had single interviews with Gattuso, with whom a great feeling developed immediately.” Osimhen is expected to wear the number 9 jersey when he resumes at the club. Copyright PUNCH.
