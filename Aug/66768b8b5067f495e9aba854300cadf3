Adeyinka Olaseni, Benin The Edo State chapters of the All Progressive Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party have accused each other of being responsible for the shooting at a PDP rally in Igueben. The Edo State APC Governorship Election Media Campaign Council, on Thursday, blamed the PDP governorship candidate, Governor Godwin Obaseki, for the shooting, stating that the ugly incident affirmed its previous allegation of the governor’s importation of guns and going about with buses full of armed thugs in his convoy. Reacting to the APC’s statement, the state PDP Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, said there was no shooting at the rally in Igueben, adding, “Nothing like that happened.” Nehikhare noted that the APC should be questioned since they know so much about what happened at another party’s rally, adding, “The APC should be questioned. They know so much about what happened. They have become so desperate.” “There was no shooting, our people do not carry arms, they are the ones who carry arms. They have run out of what to say, they should look for something else to do.” However, Mayaki insisted that by residents confirmed that chaos broke out on Wednesday around the residence of a PDP Chieftain, Chief Tom Ikimi, when armed thugs escorting the Governor Obaseki’s campaign turned on each other in a wild shooting that sent at least one person to the hospital with a leg riddled by bullets.
