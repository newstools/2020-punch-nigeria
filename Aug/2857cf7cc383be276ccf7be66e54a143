THE factional 17 lawmakers of the Edo State House of Assembly on Tuesday met amidst tight security during which they inaugurated 17 committees. The factional House, which alleged planned attack, also received two petitions over the withdrawal of salaries and entitlements of elected councillors in the 18 local government areas over their refusal to defect to the Peoples Democratic Party with Governor Godwin Obaseki, as well as the removal of the vice chairman of the Owan East Local Government Area from office which it referred to a committee to investigate and report back in two weeks. At the sitting, the lawmakers condemned the continued siege on the House of Assembly complex by people they described as hoodlums, which had led them to be meeting in a rented hall. The factional Speaker, Victor Edoror, set up 17 committees which he said “will help in smooth running of the House.” The member representing Uhunmwonde constituency, Washington Osifo alleged plots to attack members. Edoror in his reaction condemned the plot adding, “Democracy is a game of numbers and we have absolute majority. We call on our colleagues to retrace their steps and join us.” Edoror also said the Clerk of the house who he alleged had been aiding seven lawmakers to meet has been suspended and would be investigated. They adjourned sitting to Tuesday, August 25th. Copyright PUNCH.
