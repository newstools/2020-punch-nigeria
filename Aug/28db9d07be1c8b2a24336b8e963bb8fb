Nike Popoola The Central Bank of Nigeria on Saturday officially changed the exchange rate of the naira to the dollar from N361 to N379 on its website. The apex bank had earlier expressed its decision to unify the exchange rates in the country as forex scarcity persisted. It was however yet to announce if this would be the official unified exchange rate. Meanwhile, the naira exchanged for N473 at the parallel market on Friday. Experts have continued to clamour for a single exchange rate in the country.
