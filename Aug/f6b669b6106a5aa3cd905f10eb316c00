Samson Folarin Gallons of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) have spilled into the Isheri community after a pipeline belonging to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation leaked on Sunday. The Acting Head of the Lagos State Fire Service, Mrs Margret Adeseye, said the incident happened at Iyana Odo on Atlas Cove-Mosimi System 2B pipeline segment. According to her, a distress call was received around 5.41am to Peace Estate, after Petrocam Bus Stop, Isheri, and firemen from the Ikotun Fire Station were mobilised to the scene. “On getting there, it was discovered that PMS was gushing out from the pipeline linking Isheri to Igando and environs of Alimosho, Lagos,” she stated. Margaret explained that the NNPC pumping operations were suspended, while men of the Lagos State Fire Service were deployed to put the situation under control. The fire service boss warned members of the public, particularly residents around the affected area, not to make open fire in order to avert danger, pending the conclusion of the repair works by the NNPC. The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, in a statement by its Public Affairs Officer, Nosa Okunbor, said the leak was “caused by an old peg that failed along the pipeline.” Copyright PUNCH.
