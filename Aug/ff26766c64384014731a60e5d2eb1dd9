Peter Dada, Akure The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, in Ondo State has warned against using mercenaries in order to rig the October 10 governorship election. Jegede said all the stakeholders in the state would not allow any form of electoral malpractice during the forthcoming election. Jegede stated this on Monday while receiving some defectors from other political parties at Iju in Akure North Local Government Area. The governorship candidate warned, “Those plotting to invade Ondo State with mercenaries from other states with the aim of rigging the October 10 election, to stop short at the state’s borders, as the people are determined to defend their right.” Jegede assured the defectors of a level-playing ground, saying, “PDP is a party that genuinely sets out to serve people, and so, wants more people in its fold.” He reiterated his promises of giving the children quality and affordable education, providing free health services for pregnant women, nursing mothers and the elderly; and granting financial aids to petty traders and artisans. Speaking for the defectors, a former candidate for the House of Assembly election for the ACPN, Mr Busuyi Alademehin, said, “We all resolved to join the PDP and mobilise all our supporters to vote for the party, principally because of the personality of Eyitayo Jegede. He said, “Here is a man who has always been in touch with the common people, especially those at the grassroots; and we believe that if we elect him as our governor, he will do all within his powers to alleviate our suffering. “No doubt, we had got tempting offers from the ruling APC, begging us to join them but we turned them down. We are better informed and are not ready to mortgage our future; not after these three and half years of neglect by those in the helm of affairs.”
