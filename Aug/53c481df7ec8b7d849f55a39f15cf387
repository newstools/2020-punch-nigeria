John Charles, Makurdi The Executive Secretary of Teaching Service Board, Dr. Frank Kyungun, on Wednesday, said 433 ghost workers have been discovered to be on the payroll of Secondary School Teachers in Benue State. Kyungun, who submitted the report of the screening to the state governor, Samuel Ortom, said the figure was uncovered after verification of 4,473 staff across the three senatorial zones of the state. The Executive Secretary added that “18 dead persons, 70 retired staff, 193 redeployed staff among other irregularities were found on the payroll of the board and accordingly expunged”.

The committee, according to the governor, is to be headed by Commissioner for Education, Prof. Dennis Ityavyar. Ortom stated that “those who had milked the board through ghost workers must be identified and prosecuted”, even as he directed that “the ghost names be immediately deleted from the payment voucher”. The governor also charged the TSB boss to ensure that the names to be deleted do not find their way back on the payroll.
