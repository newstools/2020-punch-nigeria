Adeyinka Olaseni, Benin The Edo State Governor and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the September 19, 2020 governorship election, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has concluded his ward-to-ward reelection campaign in Edo North Senatorial District, promising to bring an end to godfatherism in the state. A statement on Sunday said Obaseki made the promise while speaking to party faithful in Ward 7, Etsako West Local Government Area, and called on the people to support him in the fight against godfatherism by voting en masse for the PDP. He said, “On September 19, 2020, we have to tell them that Edo must move forward and bring an end to godfatherism.” Obaseki thanked leaders of the party and members of his campaign team for their time and sacrifices throughout the campaign which began two weeks ago. He also urged the people to defend their votes, promising to resolve the lingering kingship tussle in Afokpella. The Chairman of the Edo State PDP Campaign Council, Chief Dan Orbih, urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to ensure that the people’s votes count in the September 19, 2020 election in the state.
