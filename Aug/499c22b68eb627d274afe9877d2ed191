Nike Popoola The Lagos State Government says it has commenced the removal of structures encumbering the Right of Way of the Lekki regional road. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Salako, disclosed this in a statement titled ‘Lekki regional road project: LASG commences removal of structures on right of way’, which was signed by Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Mukaila Sanusi. The statement said the removal of encumbrances from Right of Way of the proposed road was imperative to pave way for the smooth execution of the project. Salako recalled that the ministry had taken its time to go through the due process of stakeholders’ engagement and service of statutory notices on affected structures as expressed in newspaper publications. The commissioner urged owners and occupiers of identified structures to cooperate by moving out of the approved Right of Way of the regional road. He added that the commencement of the process of establishing the Right of Way of the road was a strong indication of the government’s determination to execute the project in earnest, which should put a stop to any insinuation of extension of deadlines. Salako reiterated that the Lekki regional project was a major road being embarked upon by the Lagos State Government to facilitate the transportation and socioeconomic development of the state in line with the agenda of government.
