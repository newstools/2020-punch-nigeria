Johnny Edward Striker Victor Osimhen hopes to make history with his new Italian club, Napoli, like South American legends Diego Maradona, Gonzalo Higuain and Edinson Cavani did at the club, Saturday PUNCH reports. Osimhen, 21, joined Napoli on a five-year contract with an option of an additional year in an African record €81m deal including bonuses. Maradona inspired Napoli to two Italian championships in the 1986/87 and 1989/90 seasons, while Higuain and Cavani etched their names in the folklore of Napoli with their goalscoring heroics. “I am proud to join a club, who have seen great players like Maradona, Higuain and Cavani,” he told Sport1 in an interview. “I also want to go into the club’s history. “I want to have a good Serie A and also help the club in the Europa League.” Meanwhile, Saturday PUNCH can exclusively report that the Nigeria international is currently house-hunting in Naples ahead of the forthcoming Serie A season. He is due to officially join the team in September. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
