Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, has said the state would ensure the repatriation of all its indigenes found to have been trafficked to Lebanon. The governor said that the state will not stand by and watch its indigenes suffer dehumanisation under any guise. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Makinde, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, indicated that the governor made the pledge while receiving a brief on the plight of Oyo State indigenes trafficked to Lebanon from the Senior Special Assistant on Diaspora Matters, Mrs Bolanle Sarumi-Aliyu. “We will pay for the repatriation of all Oyo State indigenes who have been confirmed to have been trafficked to Lebanon. Please put all the necessary plans in place to bring them back.

The govenor was informed that a number of Oyo State indigenes had been discovered to be illegal migrants who were trafficked into apparent modern-day slavery in Lebanon. Sarumi-Aliyu said while 40 of such victims have been screened and ready for the journey back home, more victims were still being discovered. She added that her office had been working closely with Lebanese authorities to identify Oyo State indigenes stranded in Lebanon, adding that the 40 victims already screened would be returning home this month. “Since the government found out that we have some victims of human trafficking, who are stranded in Lebanon, we have stepped in.”
