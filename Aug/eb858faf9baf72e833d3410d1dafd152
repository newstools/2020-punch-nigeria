Nike Popoola The Debt Management Office said it has resumed its offer of the Federal Government of Nigeria savings bond   effective August 2020 after its suspension in April. It said this in a statement on Thursday titled ‘Resumption of FGN savings bond offer in August 2020.’ It said it will open the subscription on August 10. The DMO said it was constrained to suspend the monthly offers of the FGN savings bond in April 2020 due to the restrictions on activities and movement as part of measures adopted by the government to curtail the spread of COVID-19.
