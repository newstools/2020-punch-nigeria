Tony Okafor, Awka Protesters from Governor Willie Obiano’s Aguleri community in the Anambra East Local Government Area of Anambra State, on Monday, demanded the sacking of two traditional rulers from the area for joining other monarchs in the state for a trip to Abuja without the state government’s approval. Made up of mostly elderly people, the protesters stated that the suspension of the monarchs by the state government was not enough punishment in the circumstance. Billionaire oil magnate, Prince Arthur Eze, had last week led 12 monarchs from the state to Abuja to see the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), an action considered by the state government as an affront. As a consequence, the 12 monarchs were suspended from office for not getting approval from the state government for the travel as required by the state’s rules and protocol. The protesters asked for the removal from office of Igwe Alex Edozieuno of Ukpunangbo and Igwe Udoji Iloegbune of Eziagulu Otu from the Aguleri clan for undertaking the Abuja trip. Spokesperson for the protesters, Chidi Onwuegbune, said, “Our people were taken aback by the unbecoming conduct of the two Igwes, namely Igwe Alex Edozieuno of Ukpunando and Igwe Udoji Iloegbune. “We want to inform the state government that we are not part of the action they took. We absolutely condemn their action, which has portrayed our community in a bad light, especially as the governor is our son.” Copyright PUNCH.
