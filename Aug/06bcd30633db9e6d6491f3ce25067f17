Ebenezer Bajela Former Enugu Rangers coach, Gbenga Ogunbote, says he is yet to seal a deal with Sunshine Stars amid reports that he has agreed a deal with the Nigeria Professional Football League side. The Akure Gunners have been badly hit with a mass exodus of players in the past weeks due to the club’s inability to offset the outstanding salaries of their personnel. With current manager Kabiru Dogo set to join Lobi Stars this week, Ogunbote has been tipped to replace the man who would be replacing him in Lobi after his one-year contract was not renewed by the Makurdi outfit. If he joins Sunshine, it will be his second spell at the club. Ogunbote, who won the Federation Cup with Enugu Rangers in 2018, told The PUNCH that a deal was yet to be reached with the Akure-based club. He said, “I would still want people to be patient a little bit because discussions with Sunshine Stars are still on and until we conclude the deal, I don’t think it is right to say anything. “Discussion is at an advanced stage but nothing has been confirmed yet.” Copyright PUNCH.
