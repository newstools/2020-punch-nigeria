Patrick Odey, Uyo Akwa Ibom State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has expressed worry over the whereabouts of one of its members, Mr Uduak Ikpatt, who has not been seen since last week. It was gathered on Sunday that Ikpatt, who is also the Editor of Real News, a local tabloid in the state, had not been seen by any member of his family for three days. The party, in a statement by it Publicity Secretary, Nkereuwem Enyongekere, said the acting chairman of the party in the state, Dr Udosen Ita,  had called on members of Ikpatt’s family to report the matter to the police or the Department of State Services without delay. The APC said, “Our party has been very worried and distressed to learn of the abduction of Mr Uduak Ikpatt, one of our strong members who is also a newspaper publisher here in Uyo. “Today, the acting Chairman, Dr Ita Udosen, has spoken with the highest levels of the DSS and the Nigeria Police Force in the state. Both have confirmed that Uduak is not in their custody. This might therefore appear more as a criminal abduction or kidnap. “The party therefore advises Uduak’s family to formally report the matter to the police and the DSS, and keep the party informed as soon as that is done. Meanwhile, the Police Public Relations Officer, Nnudam Fredrick, said the command had yet to be informed about Ikpatt’s alleged kidnap. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
