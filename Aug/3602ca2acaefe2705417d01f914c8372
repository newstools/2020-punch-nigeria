Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The immediate past Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, has declared that there is no vacancy in the Government House despite the judgment of the election petition tribunal sitting in Abuja, which nullified the November 16, 2019 state governorship election. Dickson said in a statement on Monday by his media advisor, Mr Fidelis Soriwei, that Mr Douye Diri remained governor until a final decision on the issue was reached at the Supreme Court. He described the ruling as “a temporary setback which does not in law affect the status quo until appeal processes are exhausted.” READ ALSO: PDP crumbling under Secondus – APC The former governor advised the people of Bayelsa not to be perturbed by the tribunal’s verdict, stressing that the Peoples Democratic Party and the government would appeal the judgment. Dickson urged them to go about their lawful duties without any disturbance because of the judgment, following a suit filed by the Advanced Nigerian Democratic Party against its purported exclusion in the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission. He said, “I urge Bayelsans to remain calm. They shouldn’t misinterpret what took place at the tribunal today (Monday). “The judgment is a temporary setback which does not have any effect on the status quo until all processes of appeal are exhausted. “There is no vacancy in the Bayelsa Government House. Diri remains governor until the Supreme Court decides. Of course, what this means is that the PDP will appeal this decision.”
