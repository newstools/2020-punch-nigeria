The National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers has issued a two-week ultimatum to airlines, who have sacked or plan to sack their pilots and engineers under the guise of COVID-19, to reverse the decision. Its President, Mr Abednego Galadinma, at a news conference on Wednesday in Lagos, said pilots and aircraft maintenance engineers had resolved to withdraw their services to all airlines, if colleagues were sacked. There had been a spate of terminations of contract of pilots and engineers across various airlines, all linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. About 170 pilots have been sacked from Bristow Helicopters and Air Peace airlines, so far. Galadinma criticised Bristow helicopters for sacking 100 pilots and engineers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that the company was not saying the truth, since it operated throughout the lockdown period, servicing the oil and gas sector as an essential service provider. He urged the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority to, as a matter of urgency, prevail on the airlines to stop the unilateral dismissal of pilots and engineers. “We demand that Bristow and Air Peace should immediately recall all sacked pilots and aircraft engineers until all labour issues are resolved or be grounded by NCAA because of attendant safety concerns created by their action. “As a result of the known consequences of these illegal actions and our commitment to patriotic fervour, we shall be forced to withdraw our guarantee of industrial peace within the industry if this call is not heeded within two weeks. ”Our union will be left with no other option but to withdraw the services of pilots and aircraft maintenance engineers across all the airlines,” he said.
