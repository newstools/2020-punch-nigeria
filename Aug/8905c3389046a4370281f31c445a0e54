Chima Azubuike, Gombe No fewer than 700 accounts were said to have been operated in the name of Gombe State government by her officials. Disclosing this was the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice Gombe State, Zubair Umar. Umar stated this on Wednesday at a sensitisation and interactive discussion on Executive Orders No 4A (Urban Development and Enforcement) and 5 (TSA) under the chairmanship of the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Ibrahim Njodi, who was represented by Commissioner for Housing and Urban Development, Adamu Kupto. Umar hinted that the committee, which is led by the deputy governor, Dr. Manassah Jatau, made the discovery following its constitution by Governor Inuwa Yahaya.   He said, “When we came into government, we discovered so many accounts operated by ministries and agencies of government. From what I have heard and seen at the time the TSA committee started sitting, over 700 accounts bearing the name of Gombe State and being operated by officials of Gombe state but the majority of the revenue drive into the account is not reflected in the account of government. “That, therefore, compels this government just like the federal government did to pull the account in one place so that all money coming in favour of the state should be in one account for monitoring and prudence that was the wisdom of constituting the TSA committee to look at the feasibility and necessity of having single treasury account.”
