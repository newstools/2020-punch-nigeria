RAPHAEL EDE A 20-year-old lady, Ngozi Eze, who was allegedly raped to death by unidentified persons at Imufu community, Enugu Ezike in Enugu State, has been buried 18 months after her death. She was buried on Friday in her father’s compound at Orukpa Imufu after a Requiem Mass was offered for the repose of her soul at the St. Joseph Catholic Church. The body of the late Ngozi, which was brought in a motorcade to the church, was accompanied by hundreds of youths in the community clad in black attire and singing sorrowful songs to mourn her demise. The late Ngozi died on March 26, 2019, after she was allegedly raped in a community school where she went for extra-mural lessons in preparation for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination. She was reported to have gone for lessons that day at the Township School Ogrute, Enugu Ezike, but thereafter went missing. Her body was later found in a bush behind another Community Secondary School, Imufu, several hours after her family had declared her missing. The deceased’s mother, Mrs Eze, said her daughter was raped before she was killed, decrying lack of interest by the police in investigating her death. She said that 18 months after the incident, police had yet to fish out her killers, alleging that they extorted money from both the family and the community. Efforts to get reaction of the state police command on the case were unsuccessful as the spokesman for the command, Daniel Ndukwe, didn’t answer calls placed to his mobile. He also had yet to respond to a text message sent to him as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
