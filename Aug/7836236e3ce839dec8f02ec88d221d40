Peter David, Benin The Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has accused Governor Godwin Obaseki of neglecting governance in the state for politics. The party lamented the rising insecurity, absence of proactive measures to tackle forewarned floods, and declining economic growth, among others. Vice-Chairman, Media and Publicity Committee, APC National Campaign Council for Edo Election, Patrick Obahiagbon, said this during a press briefing in Benin on Wednesday. Obahiagbon said, “Matters of governance in Edo State, which is the primary ratiocination why the governor was elected, have now been completely abandoned as the outgoing governor has turned his attention, full-time, on how to subvert the September 19 election through rigging, intimidation, arm-twisting, unbridled threats, violence, and other anti-democratic underhand tactics.” But the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie, said the Obaseki-led government had a robust governance system in place that was responding to the daily needs of the Edo people. He said, “The governor is renowned for his best-in-class managerial skills, a fact the opposition All Progressives Congress cannot controvert, and has been multi-tasking amid the demands of his re-election campaigns.” Copyright PUNCH.
