Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Stakeholders in the Nigerian economy on Tuesday called for an urgent realisation of the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano gas pipeline project to ensure rapid industrial development and economic diversification. Panelists drawn from the petroleum industry, academia, organised private sector and regulatory agencies who participated in a webinar hosted by Valuechain Magazine urged the Federal Government to expedite the realisation of the project. The Rector, Kaduna Polytechnic, Idris Bugaje, said the AKK project should be completed in 18 months to pave the way for the activation of the second phase of the Trans-Nigeria gas pipeline which would run from Eastern Niger Delta through South-East and Middle Belt to the North-East. He noted that the speedy delivery of the project would compensate for its late conceptualisation. He explained that the AKK gas pipeline was coming 25 years late after numerous textile, manufacturing, and agricultural enterprises in the northern parts of the country had collapsed under costly, unstable and inefficient industrial fuel. The Managing Director, Nigerian Gas Company, a unit of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Seyi Omotowa, gave assurances that the project would be realised in good time. He said a presidential inter-agency project management team was working with other stakeholders to overcome all failure factors. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
