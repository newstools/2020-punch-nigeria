The state Commissioner of Police, Isaac Akinmoyede, who paraded the suspects at the command’s headquarters in Owerri on Wednesday, said their arrest was a huge breakthrough for the command. He commended the SARS operatives for what he called a diligent operation. The CP said the suspects would be prosecuted in accordance with the laws of the land.
