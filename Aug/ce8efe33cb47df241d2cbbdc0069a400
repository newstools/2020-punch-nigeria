Ebenezer Bajela President, Nigeria Volleyball Federation, Musa Nimrod, says he is glad his administration has been able to bridge the huge gap between football and volleyball in the country. Nimrod told The PUNCH that his objective of developing volleyball from the grassroots was already paying off; saying people were beginning to develop more interest in the sport. He said, “I believe in grassroots developmental programmes because that is what this nation needs at the moment. “A time will come when my tenure will end and I will leave for another person who will take over but I need to set up a developmental programme so that whoever is going to be the next President of the federation would be able to have a strong foundation that he or she can build upon.

It’s time to start developing other sports in Nigeria because what happened in Kaduna shows that volleyball is also competing with football.”
