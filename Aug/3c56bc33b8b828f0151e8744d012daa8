Samson Foarin The Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has empowered 50 indigent residents, including the elderly, nursing mothers, youths and small-scale business owners. A statement said the 50 residents were the first set of beneficiaries of the Sanwo-Olu Listens initiative, which sought to support vulnerable residents impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The governor, during the presentation of cheques to the beneficiaries, reportedly assured people in the state that his administration would not relent in assisting the poor and the less privileged. The Special Adviser, Office of Civic Engagement, Aderemi Adebowale, according to the statement, commended Sanwo-Olu for releasing funds for the programme. She said the office had also put in place a team to monitor the beneficiaries to ensure the funds were well utilised. Adebowale said the 50 beneficiaries were among those whose “walk-in applications and nominations from various platforms in the public domain were received, screened and shortlisted by the Office of Civic Engagements according to the degree and nature of their various financial challenges.” “The process of selecting the beneficiaries for the financial support was transparent and rigorous. An intra-ministerial screening committee was set up to facilitate the selection process,” she added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
