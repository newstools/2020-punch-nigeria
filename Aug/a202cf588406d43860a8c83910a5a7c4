Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The organised labour in Ekiti State on Monday called off the three-day warning strike embarked upon in the state public service over welfare and other issues. The organised labour, comprising the Nigeria Labour Congress, Trade Union Congress and Joint Negotiating Council, had on Sunday ordered the commencement of the strike on Monday following the expiration of the 14-day ultimatum it earlier issued to the state government. In the resolutions at the end of meeting between the state government and organised labour made available to journalists on Monday, it was stated that the strike had been called off “immediately”. The document, entitled “Resolutions at the meeting of the meeting of the state government with the organised labour on the outstanding welfare issues of Ekiti State workers” was signed by the Head of Service, Mrs Peju Babafemi; the Senior Special Assistant Labour, Chief Olayemi Esan; and Permanent Secretary, Service Matters, Mr Bayo Opeyemi for the government.
