Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja The United States Embassy in Nigeria says it is concerned over the allegations of interference by security forces in political matters in Edo State and will continue to monitor them closely during the run-up to the governorship election which holds next month. The US Embassy said this in a statement titled, ‘US Embassy Statement on 2020 Off-Cycle Elections in Edo and Ondo States’ on Friday. The embassy expressed disappointment with the role played by some political actors in the state. The statement read in part, “As long-time friends of Nigeria, we continue to follow political developments ahead of off-cycle elections in the country. The United States supports a democratic process where the will of the Nigerian people is reflected in the results, and does not favour any party or candidate. “We are concerned with reports of the deteriorating political climate in Edo State and are disappointed with the role played by some political actors in the state. “We are especially concerned with allegations of interference by security forces in political matters, which we will continue to monitor closely in the run up to the gubernatorial elections in the state in September.” The embassy urged all stakeholders including the Independent National Electoral Commission to work towards a peaceful and transparent process in Edo and Ondo States. Edo State has been facing a political crisis in recent times due to a feud between Governor Godwin Obaseki and his predecessor, Adams Oshiomhole, who was his benefactor. The feud between the two, however, resulted in Obaseki’s failing to clinch the ticket of the All Progressives Congress and subsequently defected to the Peoples Democratic Party. Oshiomhole, who was the national chairman of the APC, also lost his position due to the crisis in the state. Earlier in the week, the crisis also hit the House of Assembly which led to its closure.
