Four Chinese workers abducted from a quarry site in  Cross Rivers state have been freed, police said Sunday. Unknown gunmen seized the Chinese nationals in Akpabuyo in Cross Rivers state last month and killed their police guard. “We were able to secure the release of the Chinese nationals in Akpabuyo at about 1700 hours on Saturday,” state police spokeswoman Irene Ugbo told AFP. Ugbo could not say if the ransom was paid.

Chinese firms are working in Nigeria on multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects that include railways, airports, and roads. Their workers have been repeatedly targeted by kidnap gangs. Kidnapping for ransom is common in Nigeria, especially in the oil-rich south. The victims are usually released after a ransom is paid although police rarely confirm if money changed hands (AFP)
