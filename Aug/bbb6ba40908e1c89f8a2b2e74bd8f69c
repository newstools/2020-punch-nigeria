ADELANI ADEPEGBA Nigerian Air Force jets attached to Operation Thunder Strike have reportedly neutralised some Ansaru terrorists and bandits at their camp in Kuduru Forest, Kaduna State. The airstrikes were carried out on Thursday on the heels of intelligence reports indicating the convergence of bandits linked to the Ansaru terrorist group led by one Mallam Abba at the location. Aerial surveillance missions conducted over the area also observed many bandits wielding weapons in the forest. The Coordinator, Defence Media Operations,  Maj Gen John Enenche,  stated these on Saturday in a statement titled, ‘Operation Thunder Strike Hits Bandits’ Camp at Kuduru Forest, Kaduna’. “Several of the bandits were killed as the attack aircraft strafed the area, while others attempting to escape were mopped-up in follow-on attacks,” it read. A video clip showing the attack captured the hoodlums fleeing shortly before the jets bombed the location. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
