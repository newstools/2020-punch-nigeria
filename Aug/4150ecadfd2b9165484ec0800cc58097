The Ebonyi State Government has ordered members of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria in the state, to immediately suspended their industrial action or be sacked. JUSUN members in the state embarked on the indefinite strike on August 13 over non-implementation of the Consolidated Judiciary Salary Structure by the state government. The union defiled Governor David Umahi’s threat in a recent state function, to sack the members if they embarked on the strike. The government’s order for the strike’s suspension is contained in a statement issued on Friday in Abakaliki by Ebonyi Head of Service, Dr Chamberlain Nwele, mandating the JUSUN leadership to immediately comply with the order.

Nwele, in the statement, noted that Governor David Umahi considers the strike as an act of sabotage which the government will not tolerate. “This is a period when other states of the federation are unable to pay workers’ salaries due to the negative impact of COVID-19. “The Ebonyi Government has painstakingly ensured that salaries of workers are consistently paid. “It, therefore, believes that agitation for salary increase at this time when the state‘s revenue is on steady decline is unpatriotic.” (NAN)
