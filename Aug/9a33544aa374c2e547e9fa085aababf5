Samson Folarin The Diocesan Bishop of Lagos, Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Rt. Rev. Humphrey Olumakaiye, has said no virus or disease can be contracted in the church of God. Olumakaiye noted that even when members used the same cup for Holy Communion, they could not contract any disease. The cleric, in a statement on Wednesday, explained that the principle was beyond tradition, saying it was divine. “However, in obedience to all laid down protocols of wearing nose masks, regular washing of hands, physical distancing and so on, our churches have made adequate preparations. In all of these, let the joy of the Lord be our strength, because that is what we will be spreading and not any virus,” he added. Olumakaiye commended the efforts of the government in curbing the spread of coronavirus, and health workers for their sacrifice. He said the church was the hope of the common man, because “when every other thing or method fails, the church of God, where God’s holy altar is, cannot fail.” According to him, it is high time the world came together in fervent prayers to God for intervention. “As we congregate in our churches, let us humble ourselves with the assurances that it is only God that can help us. Pray, seek God’s face and turn from our wicked ways so that the Lord will heal our land of this pandemic,” the cleric added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
