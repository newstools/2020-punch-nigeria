Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Bayelsa State Governor, Mr Douye Diri, will appeal Monday’s ruling of the governorship election petition tribunal sitting in Abuja, which nullified his election. Diri said he has, consequently, instructed his lawyers to file the necessary papers. He spoke shortly after the tribunal ruled that the Independent National Electoral Commission wrongly excluded the Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party governorship candidate in the 2009 election. Diri, in a statement by his acting Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, said he has implicit confidence in the judiciary that he would triumph in the end. He said, “We trust in the judiciary and we are appealing the judgement. With God on our side, we will get justice. “This is a court of first instance and I have instructed our lawyers to file an appeal. We have a right of appeal even up to the Supreme Court.” The governor urged members of the Peoples Democratic Party and his supporters not to panic and to continue to remain calm and law-abiding.
