Joseph Olaoluwa Lack of funds to invest in aviation infrastructure is the reason why the Federal Government has planned the concession of major airports across the country, Aviation Minister, Hadi Sirika has said. Sirika explained that only the terminals and not the entire airports were in the concession plan. The minister spoke at a webinar organised by a think tank, Aviation Round Table. He said unlike what the past administrations had attempted to do (selling off the airports), government’s dwindling revenue had made it imperative to consider private partnership in the provision of airport infrastructure. Sirika said the Murtala Muhammed International Airport terminal facilities had been overstretched beyond its initial capacity of 200,000 people. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
