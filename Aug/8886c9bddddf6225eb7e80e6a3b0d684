Peter Dada, Akure The Independent National Electoral Commission has said Monday’s Court of Appeal judgment reversing the deregistration of some political parties will not affect the October 10, 2020, governorship election in Ondo State. The Court of Appeal in Abuja had on Monday ordered the commission to re-list 22 of the political parties deregistered last year for failing to win any elective office in the 2019 general elections. The judgment contradicted another given by the appellate court, which upheld the commission’s power to deregister parties. The Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Mr Rotimi Oyekanmi, spoke during a webinar for journalists on the Ondo State election on Tuesday. The workshop was organised by the International Press Centre in conjunction with the state chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists. “The election will go on as scheduled; the judgment can’t change anything. Since none of them (affected parties) conducted primaries before the closing of the window, they cannot take part in the election and that cannot affect INEC’s preparation,” Oyekanmi said. He reiterated that the INEC would appeal the judgment, adding that there were six judgments on the deregistration of political parties and five of them were in favour of the commission.
