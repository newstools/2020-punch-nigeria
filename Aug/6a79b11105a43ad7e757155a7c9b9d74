John Alechenu, Abuja An Abuja-based non-governmental organisation, Coalition of civil society groups for good governance and electoral matters, held a peaceful protest in Abuja, on Wednesday to demand for peaceful elections in Edo State. The group appealed to the international community to intervene by supporting Nigerian authorities to ensure the peaceful conduct of the forthcoming Edo State Governorship Election slated for September 19. Spokesman for the coalition, Kabiru Matazu, who spoke to newsmen at the Unity Fountain, said the call became necessary in view of the growing tension and threats of violence which has become the norm rather than the exception in the Edo campaigns. Matazu said, “As you may be aware, it is now about 39 days to the governorship election scheduled for September 19, 2020 in Edo State. “The coming election has unfortunately heightened security challenges in the State to cause Edo people much worries particularly women and children. “Your Excellency, we request that you prevail on the Federal Government to implement a coherent security strategy to ensure the elections are free, fair and represent the true will of the people.” Copyright PUNCH.
