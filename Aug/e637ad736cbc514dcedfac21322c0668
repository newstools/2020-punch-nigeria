Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Bayelsa State Governor, Mr Douye Diri, on Tuesday, charged the 24 new commissioners, who were earlier cleared by the state House of Assembly, to be servant-leaders. He gave the charge while swearing in the commissioners at the Government House, Yenagoa, saying they were coming on board as state executive council members “in extraordinary times.” Diri formed his cabinet about seven months after his inauguration as governor. He urged the commissioners to be innovative and creative in coming up with ideas in their various ministries to help his administration succeed. The governor explained that the delay in appointing commissioners was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which his administration inherited. He further advised the cabinet members to find new ways of solving problems, saying, “You are assuming office in extraordinary times. This inauguration ought to have come earlier than today, but this government took over on February 14, 2020, which coincided with the outbreak of COVID-19.” Copyright PUNCH.
