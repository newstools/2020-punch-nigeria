Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt Residents of Ngo community in the Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State, on Wednesday, lamented the continued closure of the general hospital in the area since February over insecurity. The President, National Union of Andoni Students, Efuk Festus, during a tour of the hospital, expressed sadness that the health facility had been taken over by grasses. He appealed to Governor Nyesom Wike to order its reopening in order to avert further loss of lives in the area. It was learnt that doctors posted to the health facility in Ngo had abandoned their duty and shut it down for fear of being kidnaped. It was gathered that the hospital had been under lock and key for the past seven months as doctors posted to the facility refused to resume for duty, a development that forced the residents to seek medical assistance in other places.
