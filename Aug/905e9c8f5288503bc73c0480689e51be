Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Victor Edoror-led 17 factional members of the Edo State House of Assembly, has condemned the clearance of five commissioners and members of the Edo State Oil and Gas Producing Areas Development Commission. The legislators, who held a sitting in Benin, declared the exercise as unconstitutional saying seven out of 24 legislators who carried out the exercise lacked the powers to do so. Speaking under matters of urgent public importance, the member representing Uhunmwonde constituency, Washington Osifo, said, “Such screening and clearance must be declared null and void by the parliament as they didn’t form a quorum to do so.” Other members condemned what they called the “executive rascality” of the Edo State Government, which they said must not be allowed to continue. But reacting to the development, factional Speaker, Frank Okiye dismissed their position. Okiye said,  “Are they not aware that there is a court order today (Wednesday) that ordered that they should be arrested and investigated for treasonable felony, forgery and impersonation and we have resolved in our sitting that they should be investigated? I have said repeatedly that they do not exist and they should work to respond to the order of the court and explain themselves to security agencies.” Copyright PUNCH.
