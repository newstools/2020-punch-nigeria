Sodiq Oyeleke The Peoples Democratic Party, Lagos State chapter, has cautioned the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu against spending funds belonging to the state on the upcoming governorship elections in Ondo and Edo states. This was contained in a press statement by the Lagos PDP’s spokesperson, Gani Taofik, titled ‘Resist wasting Lagos funds on Ondo” on Wednesday. In the statement, the party raised an alarm that there would “most likely be a diversion of Lagos funds into the APC Ondo state governorship contest”. It alleged that making Sanwo-Olu the Chairman of APC campaign council for the Ondo election was a way of asking him to finance the election.
