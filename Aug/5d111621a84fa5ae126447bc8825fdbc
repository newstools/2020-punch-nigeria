Here are the latest developments in the coronavirus crisis: More than 100,000 dead in Brazil
The coronavirus death toll in Brazil has topped 100,000 from three million cases of infection, crossing the grim milestone after President Jair Bolsonaro said he had a “clear conscience” on his response to the outbreak. With 100,477 fatalities and 3,012,412 cases, the South American country of 212 million people is the second hardest-hit by the global pandemic after the United States. More than 10,000 dead in Chile
Chile’s death toll has topped 10,000 five months after the virus first appeared in one of worst affected countries in Latin America. With a population of just 18 million, the death toll ratio works out at 523.7 dead per million inhabitants, higher even than Brazil’s 472.7. S.Africa 10,000 dead
More than 10,000 people have died from coronavirus in South Africa. The continent’s most industrialised economy has registered 553,188 infections, more than half of the continental caseload, and the fifth biggest number of COVID-19 cases in the world. Global cases near 20 million
The novel coronavirus has killed at least 727,288 people since it emerged in China last December, with at least 19,674,290 cases meaning the 20 million mark is likely to be breached in the next few days. According to an AFP tally, some 11,665,200 people are now considered to have recovered from the illness. The United States is the worst-hit country with 162,425 deaths from 4,998,105 cases. France increases use of masks
French regions have increased the compulsory use of protective masks against the coronavirus in busy public spaces where social distancing is more difficult. Paris adopts the same measure from Monday. Anyone walking along the Seine in the heart of the city, visiting the tourist hub of Montmartre or shopping in some of the busier streets will all have to wear a mask, facing a fine of 135 euros if they refuse, as the number of cases edges up around the country. Belgian resorts shut doors to day trippers
Several resort towns on the Belgian coast say they will bar day-trippers after fights broke out between police and youths told to leave a beach for refusing to respect coronavirus safety measures. Knokke-Heist and Blankenberge, two popular towns on the Flemish northern coast near the border with the Netherlands, say they took the step to “guarantee public security.” (AFP)
