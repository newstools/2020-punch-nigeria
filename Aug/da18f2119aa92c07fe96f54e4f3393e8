Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri AN aide to Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State, Mr. Modestus Nwamkpa, has said that the current administration should not be blamed for the position occupied by the state as one with the highest unemployment rate in the country. The National Bureau of Statistics had released a data on the nation’s unemployment rate after a 20-month interval, with Imo State said to have the highest rate of unemployment with 48.7 per cent, followed by Akwa Ibom State and Rivers State with 45.2 per cent and 43.7 per cent respectively. But Nwankpa, who is the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Print Media, said that the high unemployment rate in the state was caused by the previous administrations in the state. He, however, said that the Uzodinma-led administration in the state was working assiduously towards finding a solution to the challenge. Nwamkpa explained that the governor was worried over the rate of unemployment in the state, adding that the state government had activated all the mercenaries in ending the trend. According to him, the governor was partnering with the Federal Government, investors and non-governmental organisations in making sure that sons and daughters of the state were gainfully employed. He said, “This regrettable development (Imo unemployment rate) was not the making of the current administration. It was caused by the past administrations.” Copyright PUNCH.
