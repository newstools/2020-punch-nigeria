Joseph Olaoluwa The Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, has shifted base to Enugu ahead of the planned reopening of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport Enugu on Sunday. According to a statement signed by the Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Aviation, James Odaudu, the Minister relocated to the state along with his aides to ensure “nothing stands in the way of the planned reopening.” Sirika assured that people of the South-East region would enjoy flight operations at the airport. The minister commended South-East governors for supporting the project as he recalled a similar situation when he relocated to the Kaduna airport to ensure seamless operation of flights at the airport. The statement reads, “There have been apprehensions about the possibility of the resumption of flights at the airport as planned, as a result of the recent unwarranted and ill-advised pulling down of about two kilometres stretch of the perimeter fence of the airport by an individual claiming ownership of the land on which the fence was raised. “Sirika also commends the governors of the South-East states especially Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State for joining efforts with the Ministry of Aviation to ensure a successful return of activities at the airport.” Copyright PUNCH.
