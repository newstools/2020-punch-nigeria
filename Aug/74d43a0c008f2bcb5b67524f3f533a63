Paris Saint-Germain have registered their interest in Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo, according to reports. Ighalo returned to the Premier League from China when joining United on loan in January. The former Watford striker has impressed in patches, scoring five goals in cup competitions. His form prompted United to extend his loan until January 2021. However, he has still not started a Premier League game for them. According to Foot Mercato, PSG have outlined Ighalo as a surprise potential target. The French champions have released Edinson Cavani, leaving them with just Mauro Icardi and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting as out-and-out central striking options. Hence, the report claims that PSG have a “very real” interest in Ighalo. The Ligue 1 giants admire the Nigerian for his experience, quality and affordability. Ighalo’s contract with parent club Shanghai Shenhua expires in December 2021. Therefore, his price tag will start to diminish over time. That opportunity has led to PSG making their first contacts with his agents. While he is not the only target on their radar, they have opened talks with his entourage. The report does not make clear whether PSG will wait until Ighalo’s loan at Man Utd is over, or whether they want to interrupt that and strike a deal early. However, Foot Mercato do say that the French giants are showing signs that their interest is “concrete”.
