Kayode Oyero Crusoe Osagie, Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy to Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki, says the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), was forced to endorse Osagie Ize-Iyamu as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the September 19 Edo State governorship election. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the chairman of APC caretaker committee, Mai Malla Buni, told State House correspondents that Buhari presented the party’s flag to Ize-Iyamu on Friday during a meeting at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Obaseki, who is seeking re-election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, will face Ize-Iyamu and other contestants. Reacting in a statement on Friday titled, ‘We sympathise with Buhari’s dilemma in endorsing Ize-Iyamu Osagie’, Obaseki’s aide said it was disappointing that the President endorsed Ize-Iyamu who is facing corruption charges to the tune of N700m. Obaseki’s spokesperson said, “President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday was confronted with a dilemma of no mean proportion, to raise the hand of Osagie Ize-Iyamu, candidate of the APC in the September 19 gubernatorial election taking place in Edo State. “The President was constrained to carry out the action, which indeed was a dilemma. “We sympathise with the President, who reluctantly handed the APC candidate the party’s flag and unveiled him behind closed doors. “The event was disgraceful, to say the least, but the President had to carry out the unpleasant assignment for the sake of his party.”
