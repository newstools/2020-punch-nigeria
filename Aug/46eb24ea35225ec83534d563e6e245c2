Bayer Leverkusen said on Tuesday midfielder Nadiem Amiri is in quarantine having had contact with someone who has COVID-19 and will miss this week’s Europa League clash at home to Rangers. Leverkusen said the 23-year-old attacking midfielder had “brief contact in private with someone with the coronavirus” and has been separated from the squad for a week. Ahead of Thursday’s last 16, second-leg meeting, Leverkusen hold a 3-1 lead after winning in Glasgow before the competition was halted in March due to the pandemic. Should Leverkusen reach the Europa League quarter-finals, where they would face Inter Milan or Getafe next Monday, they will again be without Amiri, who made three appearances for Germany in 2019.

The daily number of new infections has reached 950 in recent weeks, hitting levels not seen since May.  AFP
