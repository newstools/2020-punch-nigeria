Olaide Oyelude The traditional ruler of Lanlate in the Ibarapa East Local Government Area of Oyo State, Oba Sunday Bolawaye, has appealed to the police and other security agencies in the state to increase security presence in his domain to put an end to kidnapping and other forms of criminal activities in the area. Bolawaye, who is the Onilala of Lanlate, said this in an interview with our correspondent in Ibadan. The monarch described the abduction of Modupeoluwa Oyetoso by some criminals and the killing of her fiancé, Opeoluwa Oladipo, as a sad incident. Oyetoso and Oladipo were returning from their farm when hoodlums shot into the car, killed him and kidnapped her. A resident of the town told our correspondent that another resident was kidnapped immediately after Oyetoso. Oba Bolawaye said residents of the town had been doing their best to provide security in the area but called on security agencies to do more to rid the community of kidnappers. He said, “I’m not satisfied with the security level in the town. The village, Igbodudu, where that lady said she was abducted is under Lanlate. We know there is insecurity in the entire country and even in Lanlate. My appeal to security agencies is that they should work harder to make sure that insecurity becomes a thing of the past here and in other places.” The Commissioner of Police in Oyo State, Nwachukwu Enwonwu, had last week, announced the arrest of those who killed Oladipo and abducted the lady.
