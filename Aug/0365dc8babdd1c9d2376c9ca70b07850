Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State says the Eti-Osa Isolation Centre has been closed down, with effect from Friday night. Sanwo-Olu announced the closure at Lagos House, Marina, during the 17th update on the management of coronavirus in the state. The governor said the Agidingbi Isolation Centre would also be closed and the patients relocated to a large capacity centre – Indo-Centre in Anthony area, which would be soon be inaugurated. “Over the last four, five months, we have built excess capacity centre, but that is only the way to go, you cannot over-prepare. “We have got to a stage where we need to balance the economics of this and which of these facilities do we need to keep running. “Some of them now are having less than 20 per cent of occupancy. “This is why we reach a conclusion to shut Eti-Osa facility and another one in Lekki,” the governor said. He explained that the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Yaba “is now also gradually being reverted back to its former status as a hospital to cater to all forms of infectious diseases.” He added that the CACOVID dedicated tent on the IDH grounds would, however, remain strictly for COVID-19 cases. Sanwo-Olu said in June, the government further expanded COVID-19 testing capacity in Lagos with the accreditation of seven private laboratories. According to him, in the week ended July 26, the government successfully tested close to 9,000 samples in Lagos State, across the public and private sector laboratories. He said that it showed a 50 per cent increase from the approximately 6,000 samples tested in each of the preceding two weeks. The governor said that the increase in testing would lead to an increase in the number of daily confirmed cases of the virus in the state. NAN
