Joseph Olaoluwa The Union of African Shippers’ Councils has called for the immediate suspension of Peak Season Surcharges imposed by shipping lines serving the West African Trade Route. Siding with the Nigerian Shippers’ Council, it condemned the actions of the European Community Ship Owners Association, noting that the 400 per cent hike by its members would destabilise the business operations of Nigerian shippers. The position of the union was contained in a statement signed by its Head of Public Relations, Rakiya Zubairu and titled ‘UASC calls for immediate suspension of Peak Season Surcharge’. The UASC made a reference to the letter sent to the ECSA by the NSC on August 16, 2020, which stressed that the hike in surcharges was a violation of previous UASC/ECSA agreements requiring prior, mutual and reasonable notification. It asked the ECSA to respect previous agreements and suspend the application of the Peak Season Surcharge until discussions on the new surcharges took place. The union also tasked the ECSA to take necessary measures to improve on the general transparency and facilitation of trade relations with UASC’s members. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
