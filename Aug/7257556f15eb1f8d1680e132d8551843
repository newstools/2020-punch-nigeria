Recall that the state had imposed restrictions on all forms of congregational worship on March 26, 2020 to curtail the spread of the COVID -19 pandemic. The government after 75 days of lockdown gradually relaxed worship periods to only Fridays and Sundays for Muslim and Christian worshipers respectively. The governor noted that “as more offices, businesses, markets and places of worship open, the government appeals to citizens to maintain utmost vigilance because Covid-19 has not closed. “As people pursue their livelihoods, they should practise the personal responsibility obligations outlined in the FORWARD campaign to protect themselves and their families.” The statement warned that “places of worship that persistently fail to comply with the guidelines may be closed, to protect the worshippers and the public.” It further said Bureau of Interfaith Matters would continue to engage leaders of faith on compliance with the guidelines for safe resumption of daily prayers and services.
