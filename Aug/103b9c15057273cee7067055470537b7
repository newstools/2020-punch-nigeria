Chima Azubuike, Gombe Gombe State focal person on Covid-19 response, Dr Mohammed Kwami, has explained that the West African Examination Council gave the approval for a student of the Government Science Secondary School to write his examination from an isolation centre. The Gombe State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre had posted the photo of the unnamed candidate and an invigilator on its Twitter handle, @GombePHEOC, on Monday. The male candidate wrote his Mathematics examination under the supervision of an invigilator who was fully kitted in a Personal Protective Equipment. Reacting, Kwami, an acting director of public health in the state health ministry, noted that all graduating students and teachers in the state were tested for Covid-19 upon resumption. He said, “While the tests were ongoing, one of the students at Government Science Secondary Gombe was found to have tested positive for the virus. He was immediately evacuated to the isolation facility at the state specialist hospital Gombe. “We were made to understand that he was supposed to participate in Mathematics examination today (Monday), so we began to make arrangements to ensure he was given opportunity to write the examination in a safe environment.

We ensured all the necessary safety measures were taken. The supervisor who came to invigilate his work was given Personal Protective Equipment before he went into the isolation ward where the student is admitted.” “Majority of the time, when we isolate, it is not only to manage the case but to also break the chain of transmission to ensure it is not transmitted. Young ones can also carry the virus as we can see,” he added while urging the public to obey all preventive protocol to curb the spread of the virus.
