Toni Ufoh Cyriel Dessers has hinted that he could still play for Belgium despite committing his international future to the Super Eagles, The PUNCH reports. The striker is eligible to play for Nigeria through his mother, who is from Lagos, and also for Belgium, where he was born and the country of his father. Last year, Dessers, 25, met with top Nigeria Football Federation officials in London and also secured a Nigerian passport in his bid to represent Nigeria. The striker was set for his Nigeria debut in the 2021 Africa Cup Of Nations double-header qualifiers against Sierra Leone, but the match was called off due to the coronavirus outbreak. But he has now told Het Belang van Limburg that he is still open to playing for Belgium. He said he has not spoken with the Belgium coach Roberto Martinez, but at the moment his focus is on producing the goods for new club KRC Genk. He, therefore, said he would rather wait till September, when Belgium will be on international duty, to make a final decision on his international future. “One of my best friends is a video analyst with the Red Devils (Belgium), so I sometimes catch something but have not yet spoken to Martínez (Roberto),” the player was quoted by Het Belang van Limburg. “I now focus first on Genk and score goals, the rest will come naturally. That has always been my motto. At the moment, the national team is not an issue, we will know more in September. Belgium? Nigeria? Maybe I’ll be called up somewhere, maybe not, “Dessers said.
