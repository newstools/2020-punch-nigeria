Nike Popoola Risk Managers Society of Nigeria has called on all tiers of government in the federation to take more proactive and decisive steps against the avoidable fatalities and catastrophic loss of properties in the perennial flood zones in Nigeria. It said this in a statement signed by the Vice President, RIMSON, Joseph Obah, titled ‘RIMSON calls on government to stem perrenial flooding’, which was obtained on Sunday. The President of RIMSON, Mr Raymond Akalonu, said several necessary steps should be taken in this regard. Akalonu said there was need to undertake flood prevention and control measures (dredging of creeks, rivers, and evacuation of blocked drains) for unhindered run of storm water into the ocean. He said, “All tiers of government should physically mark and install permanent warning signs in all high risk perennially flooded areas. “This will activate the vulnerable occupants to plan and relocate from such areas as well as prevent uninformed persons from inhabiting the flood zones.” During its recent virtual monthly meeting, he said, the executive committee of RIMSON came up with the resolution on how to curb the nation’s perennial flooding problem.
