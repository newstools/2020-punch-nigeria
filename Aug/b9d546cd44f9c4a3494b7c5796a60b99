John Alechenu, Abuja THE All Progressives Congress said the recent return of a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, and a former National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Barnabas Gemade, to the APC fold was a testimony to the success of the reconciliatory efforts of the Mai Mala Buni-led National Caretaker Committee. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘Senator Gemade, Others Return to APC, a Success Story of Governor Buni-led Reconciliation Efforts,’ signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabana, in Abuja, on Sunday. The statement read in part, “The return of Senator Barnabas Gemade to the All Progressives Congress is another signpost of the well-received and successful reconciliation efforts being led by Governor Mai Mala Buni as Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee.” Copyright PUNCH.
