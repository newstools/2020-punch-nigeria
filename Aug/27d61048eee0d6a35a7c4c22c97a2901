Kelvin Ekerete Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, believes forward, Samuel Kalu, will continue with Bordeaux in the 2020/21 league season. The Nigerian was on the radar of Turkish giants Galatasaray, who were looking to replace the departed Henry Onyekuru, but nothing materialised from the interest. However, Rohr says the player never spoke to him about wanting to leave the French side despite interest from Galatasaray. “He didn’t tell me about leaving. He is motivated to have a good season, in line with the promises made at the start of the last one. It’s up to the staff to see, but I think he has a card to play in this used 4-3-3. Confidence will come back,” Rohr told afriquesports. Kalu featured for 15 minutes in Bordeaux’s first game of the season, which ended goalless against Nantes on August 21. The Nigerian will be hoping to get more playing time under new manager, Jean-Louis Gasset, who joined the club on August 10, after the departure of Paulo Sousa. Kalu had a tough 2019/20 season scoring just once and providing one assist in 20 league games. Copyright PUNCH.
