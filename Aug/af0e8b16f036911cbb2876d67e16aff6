Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi No fewer than 89 ‘ghost’ doctors have been discovered in the payroll of Bauchi State. The Commissioner for Works, Abdulkadir Ibrahim, said this during a press conference shortly after the State Executive Council on Wednesday. He said the ‘ghost’ doctors were discovered during the ongoing verification  of all civil servants in the payroll of the state government. Ibrahim said, “They are collecting salaries from Bauchi State and also collecting salaries elsewhere, they just sit down and get alert without working in Bauchi. “We discovered one single person collecting salary from the local government, collecting salary from LEA, collecting salary from health care and collecting salary from Bauchi State. “And with this system we are employing, when his BVN and his number were put there, his picture appeared there. If we don’t correct it, how would it be corrected?” The commissioner said a team was sent to some states to see how they were sanitising their civil service, saying once a person was found to be involved in such criminal acts, he would be prosecuted, lamenting that the situation was different in Bauchi. “If you see these kind of things and the atrocities being committed there, you’ll be shocked. But we are determined to correct this, we’ll do it one day and our graduates roaming the streets without any work will have work to do,” he added Copyright PUNCH.
