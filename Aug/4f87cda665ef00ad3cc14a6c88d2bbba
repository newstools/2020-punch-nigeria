Peter Dada, Akure The  Eyitayo Jegede Campaign Organisation, has expressed confidence that the Peoples Democratic Party will bring to an end the governor Rotimi Akeredolu-led the All Progressives Congress administration on October 10. The campaign organisation faulted Akeredolu’s boast that the APC would Ondo State forever. Akeredolu, who spoke at the inauguration of a campaign office in Akure on Monday, said the APC would rule the state forever. He also asked the candidate of the PDP to wait for 12 years when power would return to the Ondo Central Senatorial District. In response, the Head of Media and Research of the Eyitayo Jegede Campaign Organisation, Mr Samuel Fasua, in a statement titled, ‘Akeredolu arrogant with ‘rule forever’ statement,’ the organisation said, “What on earth would move a governor to be playing God and talking down on the people, that a particular political party will rule them forever? “It is altogether amusing that the governor has turned himself to ‘a prophet of everlasting rule,’ for a party that has left the people of the state impoverished and allowed social infrastructure to decay in the last three and half years. “That statement was not only arrogant and oppressive, it also presented a supposed leader talking down on the people, out of desperation to stave off a looming electoral defeat.” Copyright PUNCH.
