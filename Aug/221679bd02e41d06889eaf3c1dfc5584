Kayode Idowu The Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Garbai Elkanemi, has decried that the people of Borno State now live in fear of being attacked by a terrorist group. The ruler made this statement on the heels of a gun attack on the Borno State governor’s convoy in Baga last Wednesday and the mortal attack on Maiduguri where six persons were officially declared killed and 27 injured on the eve of Eid-el-Kabir festival. The Shehu called for something urgently to be done to secure the lives and property of the people and bring back reassurance of safety to the people of the troubled state. He made the call when he visited the Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, at the Government House. The Shehu said, “We are not happy about what happened in Baga the other time. It is very unfortunate and a great pity. If the convoy of the Chief Security Officer of the state could be attacked, then nobody is safe. He is the number one citizen of the state. “If the convoy of such highly placed person in the state will be attacked, I repeat, nobody is safe. The matter is getting worse, I urge everyone to raise our hands to seek for Allah’s intervention.” Speaking on the environment, the Shehu lamented the high rate at which trees were cut down in the state, urging the state government to take urgent steps mitigate the act before it  would lead to a serious environmental problem.
