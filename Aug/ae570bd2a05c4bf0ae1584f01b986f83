Temiloluwa O’Peters The Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria has expressed its readiness to partner with the government to address the issue of titling, approvals and development control of the built industry. The Chairman, REDAN, Southwest Zone, Debo Adejana, at a press briefing in Lagos on Thursday, said this was a major area the current administration had chosen to address. Adejana noted that an enabling environment was important to curb development issues such as fake permits and housing collapse. He said, “The effect of cost and time is impeding in terms of our projects and so we are really keen on partnering with the government. “We plan to have a desk in each state of the federation that will make our liaising with state government approving authorities easy.” The Secretary, REDAN, Southwest Zone, Kunle Adeyemi, requested that the government make their requirements void of ambiguity. Adeyemi said the government should address these fundamental issues before pointing fingers on people obtaining fake documents. He added that the association also planned to engage the government of each state towards reducing the 87 per cent of Nigerian households still living in rented houses. Copyright PUNCH.
