Peter Dada, Akure An Ondo State High Court sitting in Akure, the state capital, on Friday dismissed the suspension of four members of the state House of Assembly. The House suspended the lawmakers some weeks ago following their alleged involvement in gross misconduct. The lawmakers, who include the Deputy Speaker, Mr Ogundeji Iroju; Mrs Favour Tomomowo and Mr Wale Williams, were some of the legislators who opposed the impeachment process of the deputy governor of the state, Mr Agboola Ajayi, after he resigned from the All Progressives Congress in June It was gathered that their suspension was not unconnected with their refusal to sign the impeachment notice. In his judgment, Justice Ademola Bola ruled that the action of the House was illegal and held that the lawmakers must be reinstated to their positions with immediate effect. The court also ordered the Assembly to pay each of the reinstated lawmakers a sum of N5m as damages, along with their entitlements. Reacting to the judgment, the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Kola Olawoye, described the judgment as a case of no victor, no vanquished. He urged all members of the House to unite and work for the progress of the state. Similarly, the Deputy Speaker, Ogundeji Iroju, who spoke on behalf of others, charged all members of the House to work together and ensure the House operates independently, according to the provisions of the constitution.
