Olaleye Aluko Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, on Friday visited the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to make consultations over the October 10 governorship election. The governor said he also presented his running mate in the election, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, to the national leader. Akeredolu, who stated this on his Twitter handle, noted that he was in company with an APC governorship aspirant, Olusegun Abraham, who later stepped down for him. On July 21, the governor had been declared the winner of the governorship primary of the ruling APC in the state after polling 2,458 votes to beat his rivals in the indirect primary. On Friday, the governor stated that he visited APC leader, Tinubu, in Lagos to introduce his running mate. Akeredolu said, “Today, I visited our leader, Asiwaju Tinubu, and my brother, Jide Sanwo-Olu, to formally introduce my running mate and consult with them on the forthcoming governorship election in Ondo State. We are one in APC and our party is stronger than ever. “Today, I paid a condolence visit to the family of the late former Governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi. Egbon (older person) was a good friend with great vision. He will be sorely missed. We had a jolly good time with Olusegun Abraham earlier today. We can only win as one. I know we will all work together to move Ondo State to a higher level.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
