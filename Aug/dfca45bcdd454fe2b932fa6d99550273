Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, has inaugurated two committees and five project teams for the Oloibiri Museum and Research Centre. He said the centre would be situated in Oloibiri, Bayelsa State. A statement from the minister’s office stated that the inauguration, which was done virtually, was anchored by the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board, Simbi Wabote. He was quoted in the statement as saying, “I am very happy to be part of this historic occasion set aside to inaugurate the project committees that will oversee the establishment of the oil and gas Museum and Research Centre in Oloibiri, Bayelsa State.” The minister said the need to do this had been on the drawing board for over 30 years with no resolute commitment to bring it to reality.
