John Alechenu, Abuja THE Chairman of the All Progressives Congress Caretaker/Extra Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, has inaugurated Senator Matthew Mbu as the new acting Chairman of the Cross River State chapter of the party. Buni, who conducted the inauguration at the APC National Secretariat in Abuja on Tuesday, was accompanied by the Secretary of the Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe and Minister of State for Power, Goddy Agba. The national chairman urged the newly inaugurated state chairman to be guided by the new, cordial and peaceful outlook of the party while conducting his official affairs. Buni said, “The immediate task before the new acting chairman is to further unify party members in the state so as to strengthen our party’s chances of victory ahead of the forthcoming legislative by-elections.” Recall that the Secretary of the Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe met with APC stakeholders in Cross River State over what seemed like an intractable political dispute within the state chapter. Peace, however, returned after the intervention of the national caretaker committee. Copyright PUNCH.
