Shodipe said this in a video posted by Oriyomi Hamzat TV. He spoke after he was re-arrested on Sunday. He said, “The new DPO at Mokola Police Station told a policeman, Funso, that he should take us out to have our bath. The policeman took me out and he warned me against trying to escape. I didn’t even think of escaping when he said that. “But when I saw that he was engrossed in his discussion with a man, I climbed the tank stand and scaled the fence. It was around 7 pm when I escaped.”
