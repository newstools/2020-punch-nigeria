We pray nobody goes to the National Assembly to do the kind of things that disrespect the President and of course abuse the National Assembly. “We are not going to tolerate that because anyone who wants to see Nigeria progress will continue to ensure that this consultative forum produces the kind of result and outcomes that will make Nigeria better in terms of governance.”
