Dayo Ojerinde A Professor of Virology, Oyewale Tomori, has faulted the country’s preparedness towards disease outbreaks. Tomori, at a webinar organised by the Nigerian Academy of Science on Wednesday, said the COVID-19 index case was detected by luck and not because of the country’s preparedness. The theme of the webinar was, ‘COVID-19 Response in Nigeria: the Science and the Policy.’ Tomori said, “We were expecting the first case to come from China because a lot of our people go there to trade. “When we detected the first case, I think it was more by chance. If the index case was an ordinary person that got sick and went to a hospital, will the government be informed? We were just lucky that the hospital informed the government and that was what alerted us that we had a problem.” Tomori, however, commended the Lagos State Government for its swift response to the pandemic. “One of the things I found a bit worrisome is the fact that even at this time, states still have control over the numbers of cases coming from their place. We have a national emergency at hand and states are making claims; the numbers are not coming out at the right time. “If we have for example 600 positive cases today, it means they were positive from the date of sample collection and if we have had all the information and people had sat down to look at the data, they would have been able to disaggregate these things according to the date of sample collection and that would give us proper information,” Tomori said. The NAS president, Prof. Mosto Onuoha, said the webinar was organised to discuss how the country was responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
