Peter David, Benin City The candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the September 19 governorship election in Edo State, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has assured voters that his administration will end the menace of thuggery in the state. He said this would be done through the creation of jobs and rehabilitation of young persons without skills and education for proper reintegration into the society. Ize-Iyamu, who gave this assurance while receiving Peoples Democratic Party defectors from the Ovia North East Local Government Area, said the problem of thuggery could be solved with adequate rehabilitation and provision of legitimate jobs and engagement. He said, “I don’t support thuggery and the oppression of our people; only government officials wearing uniforms will be permitted to collect taxes when voted into office. “We must look for jobs for the thugs in the motor parks and markets. You cannot solve one problem and create another problem on the long run.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
