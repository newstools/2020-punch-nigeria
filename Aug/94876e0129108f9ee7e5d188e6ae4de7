Temiloluwa O’Peters The Ooni of Ife, Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has been inducted as the chairman of BSTAN Group, an Abuja-based estate development firm. The induction ceremony was held at the Ooni’s palace, a statement from the group indicated on Saturday. The monarch promised to support the group with his wealth of experience to turn around Ile-Ife and the entire Southwest. He said the irregularities in building construction in certain parts of the town was one of the reasons he joined the group to give the ancient city a facelift. The monarch said, “I am aware of the irregularities of building across our Ile-Ife and beyond before ascending the throne. And now that I have bonded with BSTAN group, I promise the citizens that soon, they will witness a transformation in Ile-Ife.” The Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, BSTAN Group, Dr Becky Olubukola, said the group would immediately after the induction of the monarch commence a South-West project to provide housing for the people. “Starting with Osun State, one the things we intend to do is to start with 500,000 houses across each of the Southwest states, starting with Ile Ife,” she said. She added that housing development was a stimulant to economic and nation building and should not be left to the Federal Government alone. Olubukola said, “We believe every state government and the private sector are in the business of nation building. “As an affordable housing advocate, if we provide a home for a family, we have solved 50 per cent of the problem of that family.” She stressed that housing development must be taken seriously by both state and federal governments.
