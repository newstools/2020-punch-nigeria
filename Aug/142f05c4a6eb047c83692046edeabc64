Adeyinka Olaseni, Benin The Peoples Democratic Party has accused the All Progressives Congress of planning to cause chaos in Uzairue, Etsako West Local Government Area which the party said made it shift its campaign to the Owan East Local Government Area. Speaking on behalf of the party, State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Chris Nehikhare, said, “We have gathered information that leaders of the APC have decided to attack members and supporters of the PDP in Etsako West Local Government Area, where former APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole hails from.” But the Publicity Secretary of the APC, Chris Azebamwan, denied the claim noting that both parties have resolved to ensure that no clash was recorded during the campaign. However, Nehikhare insisted that the decision to postpone the campaign was taken to shield PDP supporters from harm in that part of the state. Nehikhare said, “Our candidate and Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, is a peace-loving leader who places huge premium on the safety of citizens. We had planned going to Uzairue and Auchi but the APC has just released its campaign schedule that shows that they will be at the same place.” Azebamwan expressed surprise at the statement issued by the PDP spokesman, saying, “I am surprised that Chris Nehikhare issued such a statement. The secretary of the APC, Lawrence Okah, and his PDP counterpart arranged a meeting between the two chairmen on Monday when it was discovered that the two parties have rallies in Owan East on the same day. “That is the level of conversation we reached before today. If a party has such intentions as being alleged by the PDP, will we attend such a meeting? It is obvious that the PDP knows what will befall it on September 19 and that is they are raising this kind of issue “It is either Chris is not on the same page with his chairman or he wants to be seen to be active by spreading falsehood,” Azebamwan added.
