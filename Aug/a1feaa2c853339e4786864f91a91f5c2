Chima Azubuike, Gombe No fewer than 700 accounts were operated in the name of  Gombe State Government by officials in the previous administration in the state. The state’s Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Zubair Umar, stated this on Wednesday at an interactive discussion on Executive Orders No 4A (Urban Development and Enforcement) and 5 (TSA) under the chairmanship of the Secretary of the State Government, Prof. Ibrahim Njodi, who was represented by Commissioner for Housing & Urban Development, Adamu Kupto. Umar explained that a committee, led by the deputy governor, Manassah Jatau, made the discovery following its constitution by Governor Inuwa Yahaya. He said, “When we came into government, we discovered so many accounts operated by ministries and agencies of the government. From what I have heard and seen at the time the TSA committee started sitting, there were over 700 accounts bearing the name of Gombe State and being operated by officials of Gombe State; but majority of the revenue in accounts are not reflected in the account of government. “That compelled this government, just like the Federal Government did, to pull the accounts in one place, so that all money coming in favour of the state should be in one account for monitoring and prudence. That was the wisdom of constituting the TSA committee.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
