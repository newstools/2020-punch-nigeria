Robert Lewandowski ended the 2019/20 Champions League season as the tournament’s top scorer with 15 goals. He was close to 16 when a first-half attempt came back off the post in the 1-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday’s final. The Polish star ended the season with 55 goals in all competitions. However, Cristiano Ronaldo, with 17 goals in 2013-2014, retains the record for the highest number of Champions League goals in one season.
