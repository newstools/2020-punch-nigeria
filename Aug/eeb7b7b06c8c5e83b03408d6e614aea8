Peter Dada, Akure An Ondo State High Court sitting in Akure, the state capital, on Friday, dismissed the suspension of four members of the State House of Assembly. The House suspended the lawmakers some weeks ago following their alleged involvement in gross misconduct. The lawmakers, who include the Deputy Speaker, Mr Ogundeji Iroju; Mrs. Favour Tomomowo; Mr Wale Williams; and Tomide Akinribido were some of the lawmakers who opposed the impeachment process of the Deputy Governor of the state, Mr Agboola Ajayi, after he resigned from the All Progressives Congress in June. It was gathered that their suspension was not unconnected with their refusal to sign the impeachment notice. In his judgment, the judge, Justice Ademola Bola, ruled that the action of the House was illegal and held that the lawmakers must be reinstated into their positions with immediate effect.
