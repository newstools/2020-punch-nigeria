Ebenezer Bajela Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, has been nominated alongside other strikers for the award of the best forward in the FA Cup 2019/20 season. The Nigerian made three appearances in the oldest national football competition in the world and scored three goals from 221 minutes on the pitch. His impressive performance has earned him a nomination for the best striker award, with votes expected to close on Sunday (today). As at the time of filing this report, Ighal led the race for the award with 44 per cent of the votes, with Jason Cummings of Shrewsbury Town in second position with 21.9 per cent. Norwich’s Adam Idah and Port Vale’s Tom Pope are third and fourth with 21.6 per cent and 12.6 per cent votes respectively. The 31-year-old last scored in the FA Cup quarter-final victory over Norwich in June, but is part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad for the Europa League semi-final against Sevilla today. Ighalo has netted five goals in 18 appearances since completing his deadline day move to Old Trafford in the January transfer window. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
