Johnny Edward Super Eagles goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi was stretchered off after he was involved in a nasty collision in Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 loss at Bidvest Wits in an ABSA Premier League clash on Sunday, The PUNCH reports. The incident happened two minutes before half-time, when Akpeyi tried to deal with a cross from the left but collided with an onrushing Bidvest player. Akpeyi received medical attention for over eight minutes on the pitch before he was taken off for Bruce Bvuma. It remains to be seen how long he would be out, but it appears his season may be over with just two games left. The former Warri Wolves shot-stopper has endured a difficult period in goal since the South African topflight resumed, failing to keep a clean sheet and conceding eight goals in the five league games he has featured in. Before the COVID-19 enforced break, Chiefs were sitting comfortably at the top of the ABSA Premiership, but following the restart, Ernst Middendorpâ€™s men have picked up just five points out of a possible 15 to allow Mamelodi Sundowns close up the gap. A win for Mamelodi Sundowns against Baroka FC will see them move to the summit of the league, three points ahead of Chiefs. Both teams are currently tied on 53 points with Sundowns playing a game less. Copyright PUNCH.
