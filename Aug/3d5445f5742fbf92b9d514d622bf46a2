He reportedly admitted that the van belongs to him and that he bought the Army plate number from serving personnel. Also, he was said to have revealed that the Army uniform he wore was bought at Mammy market within the barracks. This, it was gathered, was possible because he “grew up in the barracks and has a military background, though not a soldier”.
