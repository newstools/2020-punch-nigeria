Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Chief of Staff to the President, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, on Thursday received some traditional rulers from Anambra State at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The state government had earlier in the day suspended the monarchs for one year for travelling out of the state without permission. The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, announced their visit in a statement. Adesina said the traditional rulers expressed appreciation to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for his commitment to development of the country in general, and the South-East in particular. He said the monarchs were led to the Presidential Villa by Prince Arthur Eze. Adesina said the Chief of Staff added that the gesture would encourage the President to do even more for the region and the country as a whole. “As it is generally said in most parts of the country, when you thank somebody for what he has done, he is encouraged, and does more. This is an incentive for the President to do more for the country, and also for the South East,” Gambari reportedly said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
