Peter Dada, Akure A man, identified as Muyiwa Ayorinde, was mobbed at the Oke Aro area of Akure, Ondo State capital, for allegedly dumping his own baby inside a canal in the area. The 32-year-old man was said to have kept the baby inside a black bag and thrown him inside the canal. He was, however, caught by the residents of the area who later handed him over to the police. A source narrated that the cry of the baby inside the bag attracted the people who were then monitoring the suspect’s movement. He said, “I saw the young man looking strange as he alighted from an okada (motorcycle) and pulled out a black bag and dropped it inside the canal and we heard a baby crying aloud. That was when we knew what he wanted to do. People usually come from different places to dump things in this canal and we have to make it a point of duty to stop them. “The man is a wicked man to have come to the place to dump his own baby. Thank God for the swift intervention of the security men who came around; the people there would have killed him.” According to the source, the baby was admitted to a nearby hospital, where a doctor confirmed that he had died. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, said he had yet to be briefed about the incident. Copyright PUNCH.
