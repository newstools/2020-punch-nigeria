ADELANI ADEPEGBA The Federal Capital Territory Administration on Saturday demolished 134 houses in Apo Akpmajenya community to allow for the construction of a major road network in the area. This is coming over one week after the administration pulled down 102 houses built on waterways in Gwagwalada and four days after it also demolished 25 houses in the Kyami District of Abuja. The Chairman, FCT Ministerial Task Force on City Sanitation, Mr Ikharo Attah, who coordinated the exercise, said the FCTA Minister, Mallam Muhammad Bello, was desirous of “safeguarding the fidelity of the Abuja master plan.” Attah said the FCTA satisfied all the requirements of the law before carrying out the exercise. The Director, Department of Development Control, FCTA, Mallam Muhktar Galadima, explained that the community had been marked for demolition since January. He said the relevant government agencies had engaged the residents and sensitised them on the need to leave the area because it fell within the corridor of the Outer Southern Expressway and one of the road interchanges linking Oladipo Diya Road, an arterial road, with the Outer Southern Expressway.
