CHIMA AZUBUIKE The Gombe State Government has said the state was in the process of establishing cattle grazing reserves to resolve the perennial herders-farmers conflict in the state. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Muhammad Magaji, disclosed this at an event organised by the state chapter of the Small Scale Women Farmers Organisation in Nigeria. Magaji, who was represented at the event by Mr Yinusa Mele, said the development would go a long way in boosting agriculture, increasing food security and promoting peaceful coexistence in the state. The event, tagged ‘Public Financing of Agriculture at the Stakeholders’ Consultative Meeting on 2021 Agriculture Budget,’ was held in collaboration with Action Aid Nigeria. Magaji said, “Grazing reserves are being mapped by the ministry; this is to reduce herders/farmers conflict in the state.” According to a communique read by SWOFON Secretary, Esther Gibson, the women farmers urged the state government to increase the budget for agriculture from N35m to N50m in the 2021 budget. It read in part, “The state government should increase the budgetary allocation of small scale women farmers’ in 2021 to N50m. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
