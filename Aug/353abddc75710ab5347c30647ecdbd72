Friday Olokor, Abuja The National Coordinator of National Malaria Elimination Programme, Dr. Audu Mohammed, has cautioned stakeholders in the health sector against the disruptions in malaria prevention programme. Mohammed, who was represented by the Head, Advocacy Communication and Social Mobilisation Unit of the agency, Mr Okoronkwo Chukwu, at a briefing in Abuja. He warned governments in Sub-Saharan Africa to work towards increasing access to healthcare services despite the several challenges posed by COVID-19. The NMEP CEO said the coronavirus pandemic had disrupted some malaria prevention and treatment programmes such as the insecticide-treated net campaigns. “Lockdown, restrictions on gatherings of people, COVID-19 related stigma have affected the malaria elimination programme.  Members of the pubic are also scared of visiting health care facilities for care given that COVID-19 symptoms are similar to those of malaria. “The disruption of malaria prevention and treatment programme during COVID-19 response must be minimised as failure to do so could lead to catastrophic loss of life. Although Nigeria had recorded some progress in reduction of malaria prevalence from 42 per cent to 23 per cent, along with a 38 per cent reduction in mortality, according to the 2018 National Demographic Health Survey results, a lot still needs to be done to achieve in the country’s current malaria strategic plan,” Mohammed said. Audu added that limited access to anti-malaria medicines had constituted a major impediment to the fight against malaria and other health issues in the country and the African region.
