Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, says his position as the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party National Campaign Council for Edo 2020 Governorship Election will not affect the governance and development of his state. Wike stated this on Friday while speaking to journalists in Port Harcourt after a routine inspection of on-going projects under the state urban renewal programme. The governor stressed that he has a unique campaign strategy to make the people of Edo return Governor Godwin Obaseki come September 19. He said, “Campaign doesn’t mean that you only go outside. We have our own strategy for campaigning. We are liaising with the Edo Local Campaign Organisation on our winning strategies. “So it does not affect governance and the building of infrastructure to develop the state. The campaign is not distracting me because I am focused on delivering on the promises I made to Rivers people.” READ ALSO: Tinubu behind Edo Assembly crisis –Dan Orbih On the Real Madrid Academy being constructed at Elekahia, Wike said the August 2020 deadline for the completion of the project was sacrosanct. He, however, said the government was yet to decide on the September resumption date for academic activities in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The Real Madrid Academy is almost ready. So, we believe that with the level of work done so far, the August deadline will be achievable,” he said.
