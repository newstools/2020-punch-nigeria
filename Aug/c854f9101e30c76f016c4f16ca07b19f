Joseph Olaoluwa The Federal High Court in Port Harcourt has convicted three persons accused of hijacking an Equatorial Guinean flagged vessel named, MV ELOBEY VI, off Equatorial Guinea’s coast on March 21. According to a statement emailed by the Head, Corporate Communications of NIMASA, Philip Kaynet, three accused persons; Binaebi Johnson, Daniel Lemmar and Ghane Gordon were convicted under the new Antipiracy Act 2019 and ordered to pay N20m each by Justice Mohammed Sani. The convicts were among nine persons that the Nigerian Navy had arrested allegedly for being members of a kidnapping syndicate. Others included Hassan Hakeem, Gregory Smith, Ofem Uket, John Mark, Chidi Amadi and Eze Amadi. They were said to have demanded a $2m ransom for kidnap victims out of which $200,000 was eventually paid, according to the statement. NIMASA Director-General, Bashir Jamoh said the conviction was a signal that Nigeria was in the right path in the war against piracy and other crimes on the nation’s waterways. Jamoh was quoted to have said, “This will serve as a deterrent to other criminal elements who are still engaged in the nefarious activities on our waterways. He added that the agency would not relent on its efforts to ensure a safe and secure maritime domain in line with its mandate. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
