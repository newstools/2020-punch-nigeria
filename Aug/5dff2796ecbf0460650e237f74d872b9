Johnny Edward Victor Osimhen’s agent William D’Avilla says his client is not under pressure at Serie A giants Napoli. Osimhen joined Napoli in an African record €80m, including add-ons, and becoming the Partenopei’s most expensive player ever. The Nigeria international started off his Italian career with a hat-trick in Friday’s 11-0 win against fourth division club L’ Aquilla in a test game D’Avilla believes the 21-year-old has the attribute to play for a big club and is handling the situation well. We are extremely happy with Victor’s performance. He called me and confessed that he was extremely happy for the first goals for the Azzurri,” D’Avila told Radio Punto Nuovo. “If he feels the pressure now? No, why should he? He’s not experiencing any kind of pressure, he knows how to be a great striker. His goal is to score a lot of goals, so no pressure. “His first impressions on Napoli and Gattuso? Perfect, everything. Victor already feels at home.” Napoli will continue their preparation at the Castel di Sangro ahead of the start of the 2020/21 Serie A season. Copyright PUNCH.
