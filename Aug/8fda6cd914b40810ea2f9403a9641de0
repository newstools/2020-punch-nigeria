Joseph Olaoluwa The Federal Road Safety Corps has commenced legal proceedings against a tricycle rider who was seen destroying the FRSC patrol vehicle in a viral video recorded along Sapele Road in Benin, Edo State and the seven-man patrol team involved in the incident. Recall that last month, an unidentified tricycle rider was caught on camera assaulting a personnel of the Federal Road Safety Corps along Sapele Road after he was arrested for reckless driving. According to a statement by the Corps Public Education Officer, Assistant Corps Marshal Bisi Kazeem, on Sunday, the case against the erring driver was filed in a charge with number, MEV/177C/2020, on July 22, 2020  before a magistrate,  Mrs E. Ojehumen, at the Evbuoriaria Magistrates’ Court 8, Sapele, while the FRSC men appeared before a disciplinary panel constituted by the corps. He said the defendant pleaded not guilty to two counts bordering on breach of public peace and malicious damage of the FRSC vehicle. Kazeen added that the disciplinary panel recommended that the FRSC team be sanctioned with loss of seniority and reduction in rank. “The counsel for the defendant applied for bail which was granted by the court, and the case was adjourned to 5the of August, 2020. “The affected road safety officials were also punished with redeployment from their present command in addition to the reduction in rank awarded by the disciplinary panel. “The officials were found to be guilty of misconduct, and liable of unprofessional and unethical behaviour towards a road traffic offender – an act that contradicts the patrol operational ethics of the Corps,” the statement said.
