Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Director-General, Bureau of Public Enterprises, Alex Okoh, on Wednesday assured workers of the Nigerian Postal Service that the ongoing reform of the postal service would not lead to job losses or retrenchment. He said the reform would rather create more jobs in the subsidiaries that would emerge after the reform. Receiving the leadership of the National Union of Postal and Telecommunications Employees led by its President, Nehemiah Buba, Okoh said NIPOST after the reform would still remain 100 per cent entity of the Federal Government. He said in a statement issued by the spokesperson of the agency, Amina Othman, that the reform had the aim of commercialising NIPOST services and making it robust to deliver more efficient postal service. He informed the labour leaders that already three commercial ventures, NIPOST Properties and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Company; and NIPOST Microfinance bank Limited had been carved out of NIPOST. Okoh said the bureau had completed the registration of NIPOST Properties and Development Company and NIPOST Transport and Logistics Company at the Corporate Affairs Commission. He said the process for the registration at CAC and also that of obtaining regulatory approvals from the Central Bank of Nigeria for NIPOST Microfinance bank had also commenced. The BPE boss said the benefits of the reform of the sector included the provision of efficient postal services and utilisation of vast assets of NIPOST across the country. Copyright PUNCH.
