John Alechenu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has said the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party are the ones who owe Nigerians an apology for mismanaging the nation for 16 years. National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, said this in an interview in response to a demand by the Atiku Media Office that the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and the ruling party should apologise to Nigerians  for taking “reckless” loans. Nabena said it was curious that a man who alongside his party, wasted 16 years of opportunities to put Nigeria on the world map of development was the same person demanding an apology from a regime which was giving Nigerians value for their money. He said, “Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar is not in any position to talk about borrowing and not paying back or asking anyone to tender an apology to Nigerians for loans taken by this administration to rebuild Nigeria.

Nabena said there would have been little need for the borrowings this regime had embarked upon if the previous PDP-led administration had done the right thing by making judicious use of the money made from the sale of crude which reached a peak of over $100 per barrel.
