A former Governor of Bayelsa State, Chief Seriake Dickson, has congratulated the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), and the Bayelsa State Government for the inauguration of theÂ  headquarters of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board in Yenagoa. Dickson also congratulated the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, and the Executive Secretary of the NCDMB, Dr Simbi Wabote, for the successful completion of the 17-storey building in the state capital. The former governor, in a statement by his Media Advisor, Mr Fidelis Soriwei, on Friday said the state government, under his administration, partnered the NCDMB by donating the land for the 10MW power plant designed to supply uninterrupted power to the building. Dickson commended the Federal Government for the multibillion-naira structure which, according to him, added to the beauty of the fast-growing Yenagoa metropolis, in addition to its economic benefits to the area. The former governor said his administration dualised the Isaac Boro Road, which passes through the NCDMB headquarters, and constructed the Restoration Flyover to decongest traffic in anticipation of the world-class developmental projects planned for the area, which also plays the host to the beautiful Oxbow Lake.
