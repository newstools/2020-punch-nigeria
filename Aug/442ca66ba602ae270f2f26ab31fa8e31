PETER DADA The Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, has denied the report that he planned to arrest his predecessor, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, using the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. A report had circulated online saying Akeredolu allegedly threatened to expose Mimiko to the anti-graft agency. But the governor said he had no such plans. Akeredolu, in a statement issued on Saturday by the state Commissioner for Information, Mr Donald Ojogo, described the report as falsehood and mischievous. In the statement titled, ‘Re: Threat to expose Mimiko to EFCC,’ the governor said his political differences with Mimiko would never destroy their cordial relationship which spanned over 40 years. The statement read, “The widely circulated story line is untrue, puerile and utterly mischievous. It is, in all intents, a cleverly laid path for the two friends to engage in a needless mudslinging. “It is perhaps pertinent to state unequivocally that Governor Akeredolu does not desire, not even in the least of anyone’s imagination, to travel such pernicious path typical of those who have taken the route of perfidy for the sake of their political ambitions. We have since wished them well even in their self-inflicted tears of treachery and betrayal. “Governor Akeredolu has nothing against his friend and immediate past predecessor. He has chosen to allow posterity to intercede and interpret the roles of men in whatever form. “In this regard, the friendship of the duo shall remain unaffected by the current political permutations, alignments and realignment, however impotently strange. Governor Akeredolu shall maintain that cordiality even in the face of opportunism.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
