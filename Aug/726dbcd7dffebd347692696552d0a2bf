’Tosin Oluwalowo Former Super Eagles striker, Victor Anichebe, eyes a return to football after a two-year absence from the game. In an interview with Sky Sports, the 32-year-old who last played for Chinese side Beijing Enterprise, said he would love to play again in England, where he has an “unfinished business.” “I feel hungry to play but only if the right opportunity comes. I am working on a lot of other things right now but if the right opportunity comes then I would definitely play. “Last year I trained with my friend Darren Moore at Doncaster. It was really good to be in and around (the team atmosphere). “I’ve had a few options to go abroad but I feel I want to play in England. I feel like I have unfinished business in England. I would prefer to stay in England for another two years. “Right now is the fittest I have ever been. We will see if a good opportunity comes and I’ll assess if I actually want to take it and we’ll go from there.” The ex-Everton forward also said he would love to own a club after finally hanging his boots. “I would like to go down that route of owning a team. “I do have a group of people that are quite wealthy guys and together we could come together and go down that route. “I don’t see why we can’t all come together [as players] and buy clubs. I do think that is another way to really affect change. Instead of wanting change, we can be the change ourselves,” he added.
