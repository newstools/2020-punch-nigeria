A non-governmental organisation, Murtala Mohammed Foundation, has inaugurated a tele-medical line to support the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control to reach patients of the COVID-19 who are unable to access the designated isolation centres across the country. The project, named MMF Medassist Covid Partner Line, is part of efforts to provide access to medical advice and mental health support for those exposed to the virus across the 36 states of the country. The Chief Executive Officer of the foundation, Mrs Aisha Mohammed-Oyebode, in a statement on Thursday, said, “COVID-19 unfortunately has redefined for us a new normal and as the rest of the world is entering the second wave of the virus, this initiative will offer virtual health care delivery in collaboration with  public and private health care providers. “This is a response to the state and Federal Government’s call for additional call centre support during the COVID-19 pandemic, to support end-users and to prevent a health crisis. “The helpline for which initial consultation and treatment will cost only N500 will allow callers to consult with medical professionals virtually, who will be able to prescribe necessary treatment to forestall an escalation of symptoms.” Copyright PUNCH.
