Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has dispatched additional investigative aids to Oyo State, including crack detectives to track down the fleeing serial killer, Sunday Shodipe. The fugitive, who is the prime suspect in the multiple murder of innocent citizens at Akinyele Local Government Area, Moniya, Ibadan, Oyo State, had escaped from police custody in suspicious circumstances. But the force spokesman, DCP Frank Mba, in a statement on Wednesday, disclosed that detectives from the Intelligence Response Team and the Special Tactical Squad of the Force Intelligence Bureau, Abuja, had been deployed in Oyo State to assist the state command in apprehending the suspect. In the statement titled, “Escape of Oyo serial killer: IGP deploys detectives in Oyo State,’ Mba said the team was expected to bring their vast operational, technical and investigative experience to bear in supporting ongoing efforts aimed at re-arresting and bringing the fugitive to book. It read in part, “The IGP, who condemned the unfortunate escape from the lawful custody of the suspect, has directed the Commissioner of Police, Oyo State Command, to intensify efforts and ensure the prompt re-arrest of the fleeing suspect. “The CP has also been directed to speed up investigations into the circumstances that led to the escape of the suspect. All persons indicted in the escape are to be identified and made to face the wrath of the law.” The CP was equally directed to immediately assess and rejig the security architecture in the state so as to prevent any future occurrence of the untoward incident. The police solicited the cooperation of Oyo citizens and urged them to provide information that could lead to Shodipe’s arrest.
