Nike Popoola A professor of jurisprudence, Festus Emiri, has said that citizens can fight financial crimes without law enforcement agencies. Emiri said this during a free webinar organised by Rhetor Place Legal Academy with the support of the law offices of DF Legal, according a statement on Friday entitled ‘How citizens can fight financial crimes even without the EFCC or any law enforcement agency’. According to the former deputy director-general of the Nigerian Law School and former dean of the Faculty of Law at Delta State University, the traditional remedies for financial crimes include criminal prosecution, which is essentially controlled by the state through its prosecutorial agencies. He said there were emerging civil law arsenals available to private citizens, some of which he identified as pre-emptive Mareva Injunctions, reversal of unjust enrichment claims, knowing assistance and knowing receipt-based claims and restitution claims. He pointed out that these civil law arsenals might be employed by private citizens against financial institutions, who were usually in custody of funds of private citizens who fell victim to financial crimes. He said this would result in financial institutions applying extra diligence in financial transactions to eliminate losses to customers. Emiri said these arsenals might also be employed by the national government to seek remedy against politicians who might have moved the funds stolen from national confers to international banks. He noted that there was a need for government to adopt these remedies in international litigation and for Nigerian courts to recognise injunctions as standalone remedies. Copyright PUNCH.
