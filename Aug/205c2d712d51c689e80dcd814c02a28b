Adeyinka Olaseni, Benin THE Independent National Electoral Committee; the European Union Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria and the European Centre for Electoral Support have enjoined young female voters to take active part in the forthcoming Edo State governorship election. At a workshop with the theme, ‘Awareness Creation for Young Female Voters Towards the 2020 Governorship Election in Edo State,’ held on Wednesday in Benin, INEC’s Administrative Secretary for Edo State,  Elder Etim Umoh said, “INEC is poised to deliver a free and fair election but we want young voters to be involved. We don’t want them to stay aloof because whatever decision those elected into power take will affect them and their families.” ECES Senior Project Officer, Sylvester Somo, said his outfit was proud to be part of an initiative which seeks to mobilise energetic female youths of Edo State to be active participants in the governorship election.
