Oluwafemi Dawodu Churches in Lagos State reopened for congregational worship today, Sunday, August 9, 2020. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had last week okayed the reopening of worship centres in the state effective August 7 after over four months of closure due to lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic. The governor had approved that Muslim faithful could start attending congregational worships in mosques from Friday while Christians could also start attending physical church services from Sunday. At some of the churches visited by our correspondent including parishes of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, assemblies of Christ Apostolic Church, the Lagos Presbyterian Church Yaba; and Surulere Baptist Church Ojuelegba, it was observed that children and the elderly were conspicuously absent, according to the directive of the state government. It was also observed that worshippers maintained physical distancing, wore face masks/face shields while church authorities ensured they washed their hands before entering worship halls.
