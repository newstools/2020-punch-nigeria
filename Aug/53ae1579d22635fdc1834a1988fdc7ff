Dayo Ojerinde The General Manager of the Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency, Mrs Kemi Olugbode, has said the agency recovered over N37.5m for consumers in the state between January and May this year. Olugbode, at a sensitisation on consumer protection held on the premises of the Lagos Island Local Government Area, said the agency had engaged in mediation to settle disputes between consumers and manufacturers in the state. She said, “Globally, there are some rights recognised as consumers’ rights and that includes the right to information, right of choice, right to safety, right to consumer education, right to seek redress and right to a healthy environment. “As of the end of May 2020, we’ve recovered 37.5m for consumers; we’ve not collated the figures from June till date. The law that set up the agency says we should engage in continuous consumers’ education.” Olugbode added that the COVID-19 pandemic had affected some of the operations of the agency, but it had not relented in mediating between consumers and manufacturers in Lagos State. The Chairman of the Lagos Island Local Government, Tijani Olusi, who was represented by the Vice-Chairman, Mr Babatunde Bashorun, urged consumers to seek mediation at LASCOPA rather than fighting or taking the law into their hands.
