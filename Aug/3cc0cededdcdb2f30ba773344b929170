Friday Olokor, Abuja The Obi of Abavo in Ika South Local Government Area of Delta State, Uche Irenuma II, has asked the Federal Government to reference the Station 7 and logistics complex of the Itakpe-Warri railway line in Abavo instead of Agbor. According to the monarch, the railway line, recently named after ex-President Goodluck Jonathan is situated in Abavo Kingdom, specifically at Aliohen — Udomi and Ekwuoma — Azuowa, sub-communities. He said the government should urgently correct the error to ensure that the said station and its logistics complex were properly referenced as Abavo and not Agbor, as it had been erroneously known. Irenuma made the plea in a letter to the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo (SAN), entitled: “Urgent appeal to have Station 7 and the logistics complex of the Itakpe–Warri Railway Line referenced by its host community’s name as Abavo and not Agbor.” The letter which was written by counsels in Festus Keyamo Chambers, Gabriel Otor and Samuel Esharefasa, was obtained by The PUNCH in Abuja.
