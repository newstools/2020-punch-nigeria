Samson Foarin The Lagos State Government has said the 2020 Agricultural Youth Empowerment Scheme (Agric-YES) Summer School Programme for public senior secondary schools will begin on Monday, August 17. The state acting Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms Abisola Olusanya, in a statement on Wednesday, said the two-week programme was aimed at encouraging pupils to embrace agriculture as a life-long career after their secondary education. “The Agric-YES Summer School Programme was first implemented in 2011 to further stimulate interest and awareness in agriculture among students in public senior secondary schools across the six education districts in Lagos State. “The Agric-YES Summer School Programme aims to serve as a ‘taster’ programme for students who may wish to pick up a career in agricultural value chain in future and eventually fill the vacuum being created by the ageing farmers,” Olusanya said. According to her, the annual programme, which usually holds during the long vacation, is for SSII pupils who take Agricultural Science, as well as their agric teachers. Copyright PUNCH.
