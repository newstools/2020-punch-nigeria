Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja Tragedy struck on Monday at a popular drinking spot in Lokoja, after a welder, Murtala Dare, stabbed a father of two, Lukeman Kabiru, to death. The incident happened around 11pm at a makeshift shop being operated by Dare along Lord Lugard Road, Lokoja. The late Kabiru, a carpenter whose shop was directly opposite that of Dare, was allegedly stabbed in the neck and he died. An eyewitness said around 11pm, Dare wanted to fight a call girl for taking a customer behind a building for a short service (quickie). Dare was said to have interrupted the girl’s sex romp and threatened to beat her up. Kabiru’s attempt to stop Dare from being violent reportedly angered Dare, who allegedly stabbed him with a knife. “Dare and Kabiru are neighbours; they owned shops opposite a notorious drinking spot whose back was used by call girls for short time services for a fee charged by Dare,” the witness added. The Kogi  State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP William Aya, said Dare was arrested at  his hideout along IBB Way in Lokoja. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
