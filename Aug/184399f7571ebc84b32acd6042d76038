Peter Dada, Akure The National Emergency Management Agency has raised the alarm that about 28 states in the country may experience flood this year due to impending heavy rainfall. The Federal Government agency also said about 102 local government areas might be at risk of the same menace. The alert came following the warnings from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency on the weather forecast. The Director of Operations of NEMA in charge of Ekiti, Ondo and Osun States, Mr Olusegun Afolayan, stated this in Akure, the Ondo State capital while sensitising some residents of the town on how flooding could be avoided. Afolayan noted that the states under his jurisdiction were also part of the 28 states and the 102 local governments that were risk-prone to flooding.
