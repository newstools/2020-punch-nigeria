Peter Dada, Akure An Akure High Court has restrained the Ondo State House of Assembly and its Speaker, Mr David Oloyeloogun, from suspending a member of the Assembly, Mr Success Torhukerhijo. Torhukerhijo, who represents the Ese Odo State Constituency in the Assembly, was among the nine lawmakers, who refused to sign the impeachment notice served on the state Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi. Shortly after, the lawmaker was expelled by the All Progressives Congress in the Ese Odo Local Government Area for alleged gross misconduct. Sequel to the action of the party against him, Torhukerhijo approached the state High Court to seek an ex parte order restraining the Assembly from suspending him. Justice Ademola Bola, in his ruling, granted the ex parte order and restrained the Assembly, its Speaker, officers, agents and servants from suspending Torhukerhijo as a member of the House. The order was also served with a motion on notice as well as an originating summons. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
