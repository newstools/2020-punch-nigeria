Olufemi Olaniyi A former Minister of Communication, Adebayo Shittu, says former Governor Adebayo Alao-Akala of Oyo State is not qualified to lead the reconciliation of the aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress in the state. Shittu described the reconciliation committee set up by the late Senator Abiola Ajimobi as unnecessary, saying the Chief Bisi Akande led reconciliation committee set up by the National Working Committee of the party should be allowed to do the job. Shittu, who had a sharp disagreement with Ajimobi while he was governor, said there was no way the Unity Forum which he belonged to would be fairly treated if the reconciliation committee set up by Ajimobi was allowed to do the job. Shittu said this while featuring on a radio programme in Ibadan on Saturday. He said, “I am talking about trust now, it is like parties that have a case and they are supposed to go to a judge who is impartial, who is not interested in the matter. If a party in a case has to go before a judge who perhaps belongs to one of the two groups, there won’t be fairness. “So, with due respect to Chief Alao- Akala, I believe that he is the least qualified to lead in the circumstances of Oyo State. “My suggestion is the Bisi Akande led committee which members are not from Oyo State, should call both sides, listen to them as an uninterested party and then give recommendations and then we will be able to make progress.”
