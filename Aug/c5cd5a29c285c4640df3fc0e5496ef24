Kelvin Ekerete Beirut-based Nigerian footballer Ifeanyi Vincent says he would have loved to return to the country after the explosion that rocked the Lebanon capital on Tuesday, but is afraid of getting stuck if he travels down. The striker traveled to the Lebanese capital in January on trials but was yet to sign for any club before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in March. “I’ll probably come back to Nigeria but I don’t want to be stuck in the country. Coming to Nigeria and being without a club doesn’t make any sense. If I get offers from other countries, I’ll return to Nigeria just to travel out again,” he told The PUNCH. “I can only leave when I’m sure of getting a good offer. Coming to a country like this (Lebanon) is the lowest you can get and I pray I don’t deal with this sort of experience again. “Everything here (Beirut), for now, is on hold till further notice. All I’m hoping and praying for is to get a better offer and leave. I’m not doing anything here, all I do is train, come back to the hotel and sleep. Sometimes, I’ll go broke and my manager will sort things out financially for me. “If I say I should wait here, I don’t know how long things will continue before they get back to normal with COVID-19. Things are really bad here.” As of the time of filing this report, at least 137 people were killed and 5,000 wounded in the massive explosion that shook Beirut on Tuesday, according to Lebanon’s health minister. It’s still unclear what exactly caused the explosion but Lebanon’s prime minister, Hassan Diab, said an investigation would focus on an estimated 2,750 metric tons of the explosive ammonium nitrate stored at a warehouse.
