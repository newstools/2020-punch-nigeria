First reported by the Daily Telegraph, Aubameyang is nearing an agreement on an extension to a deal which is currently due to expire at the end of next season. Since his move to Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018, he has scored 54 goals in 85 Premier League games.

The news of the two contract offers comes a day after the club made a statement revealing their plan to make 55 members of staff redundant, including international recruitment specialist Francis Cagigao. Arsenal, who will hold meetings with staff on Friday, said one of the key reasons cutbacks are being made is to “maintain investment in the team”. Speaking before the FA Cup final, Alexandre Lacazette said his future at Arsenal is not dependent on Aubameyang staying. Asked if he has entered talks over a new contract, Lacazette replied: “No, we didn’t talk about this. “Me, I’m just playing my games and finishing the season to see how it’s going to be but we didn’t talk about anything.”
