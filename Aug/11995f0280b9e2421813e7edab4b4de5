John Alechenu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has said the opposition Peoples Democratic Party is fast crumbling under the watch of its current National Chairman, Uche Secondus. This was contained in a statement titled, ‘APC to Secondus: Opposition PDP Crumbling Under Your Watch, Credible Elections The New Normal Under Buhari,’ signed the Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, in Abuja, on Monday. Nabena was reacting to a recent comment by the PDP National Chairman who took issue with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and the APC over Buhari’s comments that his regime could have used security agencies to overrun states won by the PDP in the 2019 elections but chose to support a democratic process. The APC spokesperson urged Secondus to focus on his party “which has become shockingly rudderless under his watch”. The APC statement read, “Under Secondus, the PDP has never had it this bad with the opposition party’s stakeholders detached from the party activities as was witnessed with notable PDP leaders boycotting the Party’s 2019 presidential campaigns and the recent Bayelsa State Governorship bribe-for-ticket scandal that indicted Secondus.

Voting power is fast returning to the people and the era of stolen and procured votes is fast-fading.” Nabena wondered, “Why will the PDP under Secondus not support efforts to ensure the independence of our state institutions such as the judiciary, INEC, and our security services and ultimately deepen our democracy and improve our electioneering system?”
