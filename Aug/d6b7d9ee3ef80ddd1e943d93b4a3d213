Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Johnson Kokumo, on Wednesday, paraded the six suspects who allegedly raped and killed a 100-Level Microbiology student of the University of Benin, Uwaila Vera Omozuwa, in a church in Ihovbe quarters in Benin. The suspects are Nelson Ogbebor, Akato Valentine, Mrs Tina Samuel, Mrs Mary Ade, Nosa Osabohien and Collins Ulegbe. Recall that the late Uwaila had gone to the church to read when the suspects raped and inflicted serious injury on her that eventually led to her death. The CP said, “The matter is of great concern to the Inspector General of Police,  Muhammed Adamu, who sent homicide experts to work with our policemen in Benin. “What we are seeing today is a result of the efforts of the police to get at the root of the crime, and today, I announce to you that the perpetrators have been arrested.” READ ALSO: Katsina man remanded over alleged sodomy of 19-year-old boy Kokumo said the post-mortem confirmed that the deceased was raped.
