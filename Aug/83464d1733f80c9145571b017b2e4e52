…State under siege of dislodged bandits –Sule Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja Nasarawa Governor, Abdullahi Sule, on Tuesday met with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, over the worsening security situation in his state. Sule told State House correspondents after the meeting that Nasarawa had been in the news lately as a result of the kidnappings and killings recorded. He recalled that a traditional ruler was recently killed in the state. The governor, however, attributed the security challenges to bandits who he said were dislodged from the North West and North East. He said the bandits were taking advantage of the rocky nature of the state to operate. Sule noted that some hunters and members of vigilante groups had risen up to the challenge. He said, “Hunters as well as the vigilante groups in Nasarawa State are able to follow because they are very familiar with the places. “The criminals in Nasarawa State are new, they are not from Nasarawa State, so as a result of that, our own people are more familiar with the ground and are able to follow where they are. “We have some of the bandits that were dislodged from the North West and the North East and they found some of these hilly places in Nasarawa State comfortable. So, they moved to those locations and as a result of that, we followed up to ensure that we track them based on what they do. “There are people who actually go on the way to the villages and the cities and sometimes kidnap people and we follow them and we also have armed robbers. We have all the three in Nasarawa.” The governor expressed the belief that with the support of security agencies in the state, the security challenges would be tackled. He said he thanked the President for accepting to set up the third Mobile Police training college in Nasarawa State, coming after the ones in Borno and Osun states.
