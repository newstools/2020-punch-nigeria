Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Some supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party in Bayelsa State, on Thursday, staged a protest in Yenagoa, the state capital, against the alleged disqualification of three aspirants for the Central Senatorial bye-election. Those disqualified are a former Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Monday-Bubou Obolo former Secretary to the State Government, Gideon Ekeuwei; and former Director-General of the state Geographical Integrated Service, Igo Assembly Goin. The PDP screening committee was said to have disqualified them to allegedly clear the way for the immediate past state chairman of the party, Cleopas Moses, to emerge as the  candidate for the district. The protesters accused former governor Seriake Dickson of manipulating the screening exercise to enable him fulfill the promise he made to Moses during the controversy that trailed the emergence of Douye Diri as the party’s governorship candidate last year. Obolo was said to have been disqualified for “not being a proper member of the PDP,” while Ekeuwei was disqualified for “not possessing a valid passport photograph on his expression of interest form,” and Goin “for low performance in the activities of the party.” Copyright PUNCH.
