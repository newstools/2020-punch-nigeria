Matthew Ochei, Asaba Students in Delta State, on Monday, temporarily crippled socio-economic activities in Asaba following a protest against the alleged killing of a 500-level student of Electrical Engineering of the University of Port Harcourt, Nzete Patrick. Nzete was said to be returning from church on Sunday when he was hit by a stray bullet following a communal clash at a quarter of Ogume town in the Ndokwa West Local Government Area of the state. The students, who took to the streets of Asaba, demanded that those behind the dastardly act should be brought to justice. The protest was led by leaders of various student bodies, including the National Association of Nigerian Students, National Association of Polytechnic Students and the National Association of Delta State Students. Addressing journalists after registering their grievances at the Government House gate, the President of NADESSTU, Mr Godwin Saturday, lamented that the late Nzete would have graduated but for the COVID-19 pandemic.
