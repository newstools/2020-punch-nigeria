Dayo Ojerinde The Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party Caretaker Committee in the South-West, Mr Dayo Ogungbenro, has dismissed insinuations that some governors elected on the platform of the party are throwing their weight behind the candidate of the Zenith Labour Party, Mr Agboola Ajayi, in the forthcoming governorship election in Ondo State. Ogungbenro, in a statement on Sunday, challenged the authors of what he called misleading reports to provide evidence that any PDP governor was backing Ajayi. He said, “PDP will never work with a renegade and political turncoat whose ambition is not grounded in reality. It is a mark of hypocrisy for those who could not abide by the result of a free and fair governorship primary to be planting fake news in the media suggesting that they are being sponsored by PDP governors in other states. “For the avoidance of doubt, PDP governors, members in Ondo State and the good people of Ondo State are all solidly behind the candidate of our party, Eyitayo Jegede. They are doing everything within their power and within the laws of the land to ensure that he emerges the governor of Ondo State.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
