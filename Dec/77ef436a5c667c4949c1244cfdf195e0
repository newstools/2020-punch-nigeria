Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Farmers under the aegis of Food Growers Association of Nigeria on Monday announced their partnership with the Federal Government in the provision of agricultural equipment and inputs at affordable rates. National President, FOGAN, Joseph Owolabi, told journalists at a press briefing in Abuja that the partnership was between the association and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. He stated that through the partnership, the food growers would bring most unemployed youths to the business of farming, stressing that agriculture must be treated as a business in Nigeria. Owolabi said food growers were trying to complement the efforts of government in the agriculture sector and that farmers had their own roles to play in the business. “The association therefore is partnering the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in providing sprayers, seedlings, tractors and other equipment at affordable rates,” he stated. He also noted that FOGAN was partnering the Nigerian Institute of Soil Science, an agency under the FMARD to improve various soil samples in order to boost the outputs of farmers. He said the association would train farmers at the grassroots in modern farming techniques and provide them with equipment such as tractors, harvesters, sprayers among others. Copyright PUNCH.
