Raphael Ede, Enugu THE President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo, has denied the existence of any letter by the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, a Fulani socio-cultural organisation, which enjoined him to ensure that Professor George Obiozor from Imo State emerges his successor. Nwodo in a statement through his Special Adviser on Media, Chief Emeka Attamah, described the purported letter as highly fallacious and spurious. While he enjoined the general public to discountenance the letter and see it as the “pitiable handiwork” of unsuccessful detractors, maintained that the leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo was not for sale. The statement partly read, “It is either that the official letterhead of Miyetti Allah was stolen or cloned and used by the purveyor of the letter without the knowledge of the Fulani group or, if the signature of the National Secretary of Miyetti on the letter is real, then there is an inexplicable ploy by some people to interfere in the election of the incoming leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo.” Copyright PUNCH.
