Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia A former Governor of Abia State, Senator Theodore Orji, has decried insinuations that former state governors elected into the Senate were unproductive. Orji, who represents Abia Central Senatorial District, said this while inspecting one of his constituency projects at Okwuta Primary School, Isieke Ibeku, on Sunday. He said, “You see, all this hate speech- people saying that former governors are there sleeping. Are we sleeping and producing those bills? They say former governors go there to relax, they are sleeping and that they are not doing anything. But you see the output of one person and all of us. Combine them and you will know the total output that we have generated in the senate.” The federal lawmaker explained that the 12-classroom block which is part of his 2019/2020 constituency projects, would improve the enrolment of pupils and provide a conducive environment for teaching and learning. The former governor also took time out to speak about the recent defection of the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, from the PDP. He said, “I am not worried at all. Every person has his own objective. He knows why he has gone.” Copyright PUNCH.
