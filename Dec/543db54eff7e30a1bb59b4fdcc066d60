Tukur Muntari, Kano The Aminu Wali faction of the People’s Democratic Party in Kano State has dissociated itself from the Kwansiyya faction of the party which said it would not participate in the forthcoming Local Government polls scheduled for January 16, 2020. The party chairman of Dala Local Government and interim state chairman, Muhammina Lamido, stated this at a news conference in Kano on Wednesday. He said, “The attention of the PDP interim Administrative Committee in Kano state has been drawn to a media statement credited to one Hon. Danladi Abdullahamid in which the said person was reported as saying that the PDP in the state does not have candidates and may not partake in forthcoming local government elections. “This is far from the truth as PDP in the state did not authorise the said person to make the said statement. “As matters stand, the only organ of PDP with the power to act under section 24 (2) (b) of the party constitution, is the state Executive Committee through the interim Administrative Committee led by the chairman.” According to him, preparations for participation in the election are on top gear and the committee would soon inform the general public and KANSIEC of its candidates for the election. He, however, called on the KANSIEC to bring down the cost of the nomination forms to enable opposition parties’ candidates to participate in the election.
