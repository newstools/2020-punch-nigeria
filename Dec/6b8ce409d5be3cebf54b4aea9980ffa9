Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki A former President of the Senate, Pius Anyim, has thrown his weight behind rotational presidency, saying Nigeria needs it to remain united. He expressed confidence that the election of a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction in 2023 was possible. Anyim, also advocated constitutional backing for the existence of the nation’s six geo-political zones as well as devolution of powers to the federating units. The former SGF made this position public during a lecture at the 6th World Igbo Summit at Gregory University, Uturu, Abia State, on Saturday. He said, “Even though the zonal structure has not found legal backing, there is no gainsaying that it has assumed a moral force waiting to be constitutionalised. “The other angle to this perspective is whether zoning the presidency to the South-East geo-political zone is a right? Legally, the answer is no, but morally there is merit in such demand. “Nigeria as a country must work to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the zoning of the presidency of the country to the various and identified geo-political zones to avert disharmony in the nation’s body polity.” Copyright PUNCH.
