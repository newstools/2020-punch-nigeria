Ada Wodu, Calabar The Pro-Chancelor of the University of Calabar, Senator Nkechi Nwaogu, says the university lost property worth N1.3bn during the mayhem that broke out in the wake of the #EndSARS protests. She disclosed this on Monday while briefing the press on the attack on the university’s facilities in October. Decrying the “wanton vandalisation of the property of the university,” the pro-chancellor said the scale of the destruction was not given the attention it deserved. “UNICAL is bleeding seriously because of the attack. The university has been dragged backward by about five years. It will struggle to replace what it lost,” Nwaogu said. She listed the items lost to include laboratory equipment, refrigerators, armour cables and other items looted from UNICAL Hotel. Nwaogu said had vigilantes and other members of the host community not repelled the hoodlums, the university would have been “reduced to mere walls.” “We urge people of goodwill and state agencies and the Cross River State Government to come to our aid,” she said.
