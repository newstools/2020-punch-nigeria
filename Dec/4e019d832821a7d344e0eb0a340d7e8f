Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress has urged the State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, to leave former APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, out of the travails of Governor Godwin Obaseki. The state APC Deputy Chairman, Jarret Tenebe, made the call in Okpella, Etsako East Local Government Area on Monday. He urged the deputy governor and his principal to face the pending certificate forgery matter in court instead of seeking to drag Oshiomhole’s name into the matter. Tenebe spoke against the backdrop of a statement credited to Shuaibu in which the deputy governor was quoted as warning Oshiomhole not to use the judiciary to subvert the mandate freely given to Obaseki by the people of Edo State. The APC deputy chairman said, “I will describe the deputy governor as a frustrated and confused man who talks from both sides of his mouth, as well as seeking for survival.
