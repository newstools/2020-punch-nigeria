Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The Kaduna State Commissioner of Health, Amina Mohammed-Baloni, says the state will impose a fresh lockdown should the rate of COVID-19 cases recorded in the state continues. The commissioner gave the warning at a press conference in Kaduna on Saturday. Mohammed-Baloni said public spaces, including schools, markets, offices and places of worship might be temporarily closed if residents fail to observe Covid-19 preventive protocols. She said, “In absolute and relative terms, Kaduna State is now recording high infection figures reminiscent of the first wave of Covid-19 spread in April, May and June 2020.” READ ALSO: Naira will become powerful again —Adeboye The commissioner noted that “the lowering of the infection rate following the first wave encouraged the government to approve the recommendation of the State Covid-19 Task Force for a significant reopening of certain aspects of the state.” “However, we are saddened to report that the conditions that compelled the 75-day lockdown are now being replicated,” she noted. According to her, 74 positive results were recorded in the state from 531 samples on November 26, adding that “the quantum of infections since then suggests both high infection rates and the reality of that a new wave of infections is spreading across the state.” The commissioner appealed to the people of Kaduna State to observe Covid-19 protocols in order to protect themselves and their families from the infection. The PUNCH had earlier reported that the state governor, Nasir El-Rufai, announced on Friday that he has gone into isolation following contact with infected persons.
