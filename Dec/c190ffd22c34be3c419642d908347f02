Kayode Oyero Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has recovered from COVID-19, his Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile, announced on Thursday. “Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu tests negative to COVID-19. Now out of isolation,” Akosile tweeted with a video that showed the governor stepping out to address a press at the State House in Marina. The state health commissioner, Akin Abayomi, had announced on December 12 that the governor tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Narrating his experience while speaking with journalists on Thursday, Sanwo-Olu said, “It was not mild, I was not asymptomatic, I felt all of the things you would feel – headache, sore throat, cough, tiredness, I felt it.” He, therefore, urged Lagosians to protect themselves and seek medical attention when they experience any of the symptoms of the virus. Other governors who had tested positive for the virus and recovered include the Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi; Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu; Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed; Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, amongst others. Lagos, which is one of the epicentres of coronavirus management in Nigeria, has recorded over 26,000 infections and more than 200 associated deaths since the outbreak of the virus in the country. The state government recently returned COVID-19 protocols at religious centres and also banned a number of social places from holding gatherings as the country battled the second wave of the pandemic.
