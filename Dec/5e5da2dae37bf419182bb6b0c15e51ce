Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin Five of the victims kidnapped on Tuesday in Edo State  regained their freedom after their relatives paid various sums as ransom. It was gathered that the kidnappers placed N5m ransom on each victim, but their family members were allowed to negotiate and beat down the ransom. Our correspondent gathered that the victims paid between N800,000 and N3m. A source, who is familiar with the case, confirmed that five persons had been freed after paying. “It was a horrifying experience for the victims and their families who worked hard to raise the money. “The victims, who are still there, may be released soon as their families are also working hard to raise the money to enable their people to regain their freedom,” he added. The PPRO of the state police command, Chidi Nwabuzor, could not be reached for comment. Copyright PUNCH.
