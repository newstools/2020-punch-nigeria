Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The air component of Operation Thunder Strike has destroyed a camp and neutralised scores of bandits in airstrikes executed at the Kuduru Forest area of Kaduna State on Saturday. The Nigerian Air Force also provided close air support to the Nigeria Police in a joint offensive operation to clear identified bandits’ hideouts in the Kofa area of the state. Disclosing this in a statement on Sunday, the Coordinator, Defence Media Operation, Maj. Gen. John Enenche, explained that the air interdiction mission at Kuduru Forest was carried out sequel to credible intelligence reports indicating that the heavily armed bandits responsible for a previous attack on troops at Ngede Allah had originated from a camp within the forest. “Accordingly, following confirmatory intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions that led to the identification of the camp, the air component dispatched Nigerian Air Force attack aircraft to engage the location, scoring devastating hits, which destroyed the bandits’ logistics structures and killed several of the criminals,” it stated. The DHQ further said the NAF attack aircraft and an ISR platform later provided close air support as the police advanced from Sarki Pawa through Tawali towards Kofa. The attack aircraft reportedly engaged the bandits ahead of the ground forces, while the ISR aircraft provided situational awareness throughout the operation.
