Olushola Odeyinde with Agency Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned Saturday massacre of farm workers in Borno State. “I want to assure my prayers for Nigeria, where blood has unfortunately been spilled once more in a terrorist attack,” he said in his weekly general audience. Remembering those who he said were “brutally killed” by Boko Haram insurgents, the Pope said, “May God welcome them in his peace and comfort their families, and convert the hearts of those who commit similar atrocities, which gravely offend his name.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that Boko Haram fighters killed at least 43 farm workers and injured six in rice fields near Maiduguri, the Borno State capital on Saturday. The assailants had reportedly tied up the agricultural workers and slit their throats. The Pope also used his address Wednesday to mark the 40th anniversary of the death of four missionaries who were kidnapped, raped, and killed by a paramilitary group in El Salvador during the civil war.
