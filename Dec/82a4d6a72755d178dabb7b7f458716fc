Peter Dada,  Akure The Ondo State Assembly on Monday lifted the suspension order placed on four of its members. The affected members include the former Deputy Speaker, Iroju Ogundeji, Adewale Adewinle Williams,  Favour Tomomewo, and Tomide Akinrinbido. They were among the nine lawmakers who opposed attempts to impeach the state deputy governor,  Mr Agboola Ajayi, in June. Following their suspension for alleged gross misconduct, the four lawmakers challenged the decision in court and won at both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. However, it took another court intervention to get the leadership of the Assembly to obey the order of the court for them to be reinstated. It was gathered that the House finally reversed the suspension in order to avoid being sanctioned by the court which had slated a contempt hearing against principal officers of the Assembly on Thursday. Speaking during Monday’s plenary session, the Speaker, Mr Bamidele Oleyelogun, said the suspension of the four lawmakers was done in accordance with the standing orders of the house. He said, “Surprisingly, the House was not served with these judgements until recently. But because their suspension was done at plenary, the House, based on its regulatory proceedings had to consider the judgement at its parliamentary where a resolution to seek the advice of the Judiciary and Legal Committee on the court judgement was reached. “The House Committee on Judiciary and the Legal Department had advised that the House should obey the judgement for peaceful co-existence and harmonious relationship between the judiciary and the legislature.” Copyright PUNCH.
