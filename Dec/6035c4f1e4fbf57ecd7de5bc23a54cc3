Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Friday announced the approval of transport fares on the new Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail line scheduled to begin full commercial operations in January. It said passengers would pay between N3,000 and N6,000 for the train service depending on the class of seat booked by the traveller. The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, announced the approval during the inauguration of the governing council of the Chartered Institute of Transport Administration of Nigeria in Abuja. Amaechi said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had mandated the ministry to ensure the inauguration of the Lagos-Ibadan railway in January. “Today, I approved the charges for passengers from Lagos to Ibadan. We just transferred how we charged from Abuja to Kaduna,” he said. The minister added, “We charge N3,000 per economy seat; N5,000 for business class and N6,000 for first class. The same is applicable to Lagos to Ibadan. “It should have started running by now before Mr President inaugurates it in January.” Copyright PUNCH.
