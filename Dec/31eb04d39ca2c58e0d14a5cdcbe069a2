Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday fixed January 13 challenging the nomination of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the last October 10, 2020 election in the state. Justice Inyang Ekwo picked the judgment date after parties to the case adopted their written submissions on Monday. The suit was filed by Mrs Olajumoke Anifowose, one of the aspirants who jostled with Akeredolu and others for the APCâ€™s governorship ticket in the July 20, 2020 primary election of the party. Another judge of the Federal High Court in Abuja, Justice Okon Abang, will also on Tuesday deliver judgment in a suit filed by another governorship aspirant on the APC platform, Dr Nath Adojutelgan.
