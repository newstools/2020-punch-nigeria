Chima Azubuike, Gombe Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya, on Thursday, presented a budget of N119.6bn for the 2021 fiscal year to the state House of Assembly. Of this amount, N57.6bn is for capital expenditure, while N62.028bn is for recurrent. The budget is to be financed by estimated recurrent revenue of N75.293bn and capital receipts of N62.457bn. While presenting the budget tagged, ‘Budget of Resilience’, Yahaya said, “The challenging experiences we went through in the 2020 fiscal year will be used to sharpen our vision for the 2021 fiscal year and beyond. “As we are all aware, the art of nation building is a collective responsibility, I therefore want to call on all of us to rededicate ourselves to the service of Gombe State as nobody will come and develop the State for us, other than ourselves. “The 2021 budget is therefore prepared with the useful inputs gathered from the people of Gombe state, the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and the Ten-Year Development Plan 2020 – 2030.” Copyright PUNCH.
