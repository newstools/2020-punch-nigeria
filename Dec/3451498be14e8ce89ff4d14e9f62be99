Olufemi Olaniyi Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has expressed sadness over the sudden death of the Chief Registrar of Oyo State High Court of Justice, Fatimo Badrudeen. Badrudeen died on Monday at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, after a brief illness. The governor described her death as a rude shock, noting that her exit has created a huge vacuum in the judicial arm of government. Makinde in a condolence message issued on Monday by his Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, commiserated with the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Munta Abimbola, and the members of the judiciary as well as members of the late Badrudeen’s immediate family. The governor said, “The news of the death of Alhaja Fatimo Badrudeen is saddening. It is a sad loss to Oyo State and a great blow to the Judiciary, where her vivacious and hardworking nature showed all through her career.” Before her death, Badrudeen was one of those expected to be appointed as a judge.
