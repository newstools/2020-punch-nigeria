Joseph Olaoluwa Air Peace on Monday operated a direct flight from the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Lagos to the Island country of Jamaica. In a statement on Tuesday by the airline spokesman, Mr Stanley Olisa, the airline said that one of its three Boeing 777 aircraft with registration number 5N-BVE was deployed for the 11-hour flight which departed at 5pm with 132 passengers on board. The aircraft which arrived Montego Bay, Jamaica is expected to fly again into the island country on December 27 for a return trip the next day. Olisa in the statement titled ‘Air Peace operates direct, nonstop flight to Jamaica’, explained that it was a special charter flight and the airline’s maiden flight to the island. He said the flight further emphasised the airline’s capability to operate flights to any destination in the world, adding that ‘Air Peace has the aircraft and the requisite manpower to do this’.
