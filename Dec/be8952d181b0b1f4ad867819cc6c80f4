Temiloluwa O’Peters Alpha Morgan Group has held its annual retreat/award ceremony to reward outstanding employees across its subsidiaries and divisions for their diligence, dedication and exceptional service to both clients and the company. Speaking at the event which held in Lagos from Friday to Sunday, the Group Managing Director, Ade Buraimo, said the group considered employees its most prized assets, hence its continuous investment in their welfare, according to a statement issued by the group on Monday. “We consider our human resource as our most important asset. That is why we spare no cost in ensuring that they are well motivated and appreciated at all times. This has been our philosophy, which reflects on our employee productivity numbers year-on-year,” he said. Also commenting on the company’s annual retreat, which preceded the award ceremony, Buraimo noted that the retreat afforded the team an opportunity to undertake critical assessment of the current business model. He added that it helped the team strategise on how best to deliver their brand promise of ‘securing wealth across generations’ in the next financial year. According to the statement, one of the highlights of the three-day retreat/ award ceremony was the strategy session with the Managing Director/Chief Executive, Financial Derivative Company Limited, Bismarck Rewane, as well as the presentation of the staff of the year award.
