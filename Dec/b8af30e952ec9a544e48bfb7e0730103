On the aviation contracts, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, told State House correspondents at the end of the meeting that contracts totalling N758.17m were approved for the aviation sector based on the presentation made by the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika. Mohammed said, “The first memo is a contract for the expansion of the apron at the Maiduguri Airport. This contract is worth N719.12m. It was awarded to a company called Luvaslink Projects Limited. “The expansion of the Maiduguri Airport has become necessary because of the increased traffic at the airport.
