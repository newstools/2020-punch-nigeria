Oladimeji Ramon The Governor of Jigawa State, Muhammad Badaru, has expressed the fear that the All Progressives Congress may lose the state at the end of his tenure in 2023. The governor, therefore, called for unity among APC members in Jigawa, saying placing self-interest above the collective interest of the party might cost the APC in the 2023 governorship election. TheCable reported that Badaru spoke during the inauguration of the APC Caretaker Committee in Duste, Jigawa State capital. The governor asked the newly-inaugurated APC Caretaker Committee to be committed to the development of the party in the state. He said, “If we allow our personal interest to influence our collective interest, I am assuring (you) we are going to lose and by then my tenure would have elapsed. “We are the responsible members of the party; I once sacrificed my governorship candidature for Hadejia emirate for the sake of peace. However, God later made me the governor.” Badaru said going forward he would no longer tolerate APC members promoting factionalisation. “I will remain vigilant watching those of you going to meet with the other factional group; you have got enough of my patience, I will no longer tolerate that,” he said.
