Tobi Aworinde The East Carolina University in the United States has denied appointing the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, as a visiting professor, saying the letter he received from a member of its faculty was unauthorised by the appropriate officials. Ganduje’s spokesperson, Abba Anwar, had on Tuesday said the governor’s appointment was contained in a letter sent to him by the school through a lecturer of the International Centre for IT and Development, Victor Mbarika, at the university’s College of Business on November 30. However, the university’s Interim Provost and Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, Dr Grant Hayes, in a letter to Ganduje, dated December 4, 2020, titled ‘Re: Unavailability of Faculty Appointment,’ said, “I must inform you that that the letter you received from Dr Victor Mbarika on November 30, 2020 does not convey an authorised offer of appointment or establish any position of scholar or professor at East Carolina University.” Copyright PUNCH.
