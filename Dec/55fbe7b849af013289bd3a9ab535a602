Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Group Managing Director, Odu’a Investment Company Limited, Adewole Raji, disclosed on Tuesday that the company has begun to support the economy of the six shareholder states of the South-West through investment into their areas of comparative advantages. While property development was projected to be viable in Lagos and Ibadan (Oyo State), the Chief Executive Officer of Odu’a stated that commercial and mechanised agriculture would be the best idea in the other four states of Ogun, Osun, Ondo and Ekiti. Addressing journalists at the media tour and open visit of the Wrestlink Iconic Villa at Alakia area of Ibadan on Monday, Raji said the idea of the luxury estate being constructed in Ibadan in collaborative efforts of Odu’a, Chapter 4 Estate Company and Westlink Iconic Estates Limited, was borne out of the high prospect that Ibadan, headquarters of South-West, offers. He said, “We have a responsibility to partake in the lifting of the economy of each of the shareholder states. But we should not be taking emotional decisions but business decisions. “Whereas you see Oyo and Lagos looking attractive in terms of investment into property, in other Odua states, we are looking at agriculture and processing because they have arable land and their climate is good.” He said there was no competition between property development and farmlands in the South-West.
