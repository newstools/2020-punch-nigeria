Other revenue heads like IGR, sales of international market stores, land proceeds, sales of malls, other receipts etc, will account for the balance of N57.994bn or 47.53 per cent of the total budget. “We are projecting to increase our IGR from projected N10.5bn in the 2020 budget to N12.8bn or 10.47 per cent of our total expected revenue.” Copyright PUNCH.
