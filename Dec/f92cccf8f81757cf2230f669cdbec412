Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State, Mr Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, has condemned the Christmas Day attack on the residence of a former militant leader, Mr Eris Paul, alias Ogunboss, at his Peremabiri community in the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area. He said the armed invasion of the Ogunboss’ mansion, during which it was set on fire, was “an attempt to destroy his life.” Ewhrudjakpo made the condemnation while speaking shortly after worshipping at the St. Paul’s Anglican Catholic Church, Ofoni, Sagbama LGA, on Sunday. The deputy governor emphasised that the Governor Douye Diri administration was poised to work with security agencies to deal decisively with those who promote terror and insecurity in the state. Ewhrudjakpo, who was honoured with a yuletide present by the catholic women organisation of the church said, “I want to use this opportunity to condemn in strong terms the attack on the house of Mr Eris Paul. “In this government, we do not believe in violence and will continue to do everything possible to fight against it. We believe that no acrimony should get to the level of going to burn or destroy people’s property or lives.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
