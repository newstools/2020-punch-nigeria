Peter Dada, Akure The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the last governorship election in Ondo State, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, has expressed confidence that he would emerge governor at the end of ongoing litigation over the outcome of the polls. Jegede, who lost to the incumbent Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu during the October 10 election, said, evidence before the election petition tribunal was sufficient to nullify the victory of the All Progressives Congress. This, he said, has made the APC jittery. Jegede said this during the inaugurated PDP Secretariat in Akure, on Tuesday. The inauguration ceremony was performed by the National Vice Chairman of the PDP Caretaker Committee, Chief Dayo Ogungbenro, who stood in for Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde. “The APC in the state is jittery and we shall take over soon,” Jegede said State chairman of the party, Mr. Fatai Adams, charged members across the 18 local government areas of the state, to keep the faith and remain loyal and committed to the ideals of the party. He also said henceforth, members would benefit according to their contributions to the party. The secretariat was burnt down by some suspected hoodlums during the #EndSARS protest in October.
