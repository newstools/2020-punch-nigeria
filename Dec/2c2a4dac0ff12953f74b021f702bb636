Umar Muhammed, Lafia NASARAWA State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has refuted claims in some quarters that he was presently on medical trip to the United States of America, emphasising that he travelled to the US to see his children while on his annual vacation. The governor made the clarification while appearing as a guest on Channels Television, monitored by our correspondent in Lafia. Sule, who was said to have visibly abandoned hospitals in his state for medical tourism in the US, stated that he normally went on annual leave in December and took the advantage to spend time with his family in Houston, Texas. The governor added that while on vacation in the US, where he had stayed for quite some time, he equally used the advantage to carry out routine medical checkups. “My trip here has nothing to do with my health. I’m here on my annual vacation. Usually, I carry out my medical checkups even while I was the MD of the Dangote Group. “There is nothing wrong with my health. I have just finished my routine medical checkups, dental check, eye check and everything went perfectly,” he stressed. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
