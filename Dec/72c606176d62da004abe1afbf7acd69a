Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri THE Imo State branch of the Nigerian Medical Association on Tuesday said that the insincerity of the state government made it (NMA) to embark on strike. Briefing journalists in Owerri on Tuesday, the state NMA Chairman, Chidiebere Okwara, accused the Governor Hope Uzodinma-led administration of being insensitive to the plight of health workers in the state. He warned that if by Wednesday, December 9, the government didn’t meet their demands, all federal health workers in the state would join in the strike action. The NMA chairman enumerated some of their demands as the immediate payment of the outstanding arrears from March 2020 till date to the doctors at Imo State Teaching Hospital, Orlu. “The regularisation of the salaries of the doctors in Imo State Specialist Hospital, Ministry of Health, Local Government Areas and payments to correct the shortfalls pending the commencement of the 2014 Consolidated Medical Salaries structure,” he said while mentioning other demands.
