Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi The Bauchi State Government has started the immunisation of over 400,000 children against measles. The Executive Secretary, Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr Rilwan Mohammed, stated this on Monday at a press conference to flag-off the exercise which will last for one week. He said that the vaccination, targeted at children who were between nine months and 15 months old, would be done across the 20 local government areas of the state. Mohammed at the Bayan Fada PHC in Bauchi explained that the first dose of the vaccine would be given when the “child is nine months old while the second dose is six months later when the child will be one year three months old.” He further explained that a new vaccine known as booster has been introduced by the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency aimed at helping to boost the immune system of the children. He urged mothers to ensure that their children received the vaccine. The executive chairman said during the one-week exercise, health workers would go round the state. He said, “Measles vaccination does not prevent measles infection but it protects the children against infection and severity. It is one of the vaccine-preventable diseases that cause a lot of mortality and disability.”
