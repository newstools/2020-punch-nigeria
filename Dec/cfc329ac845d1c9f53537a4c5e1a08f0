Ife Ogunfuwa The Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture has advised the Federal Government to get the Organised Private Sector and other stakeholders in the articulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies. The association gave this advice in a communiqué issued on Tuesday after its 2020 4th quarter council meeting held in Port Harcourt. It said the council meeting was attended by members of chambers of commerce from across the country and was presided over by the National President of NACCIMA, Hajiya Saratu Aliyu. NACCIMA executives said as the government embarked on finding a way out of economic recession, it must work closely with the private sector. The communiqué stated that the council observed that the third quarter contraction of the economy had been predicted in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the drop in crude oil prices, and the recent civil unrest. The council noted that there was a need for proper synergy of monetary and fiscal policies that would engender inclusive growth and development in some strategic sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing and mining. “Most importantly, the OPSN must be taken on board in the articulation of policies, policy implementation, and the process of monitoring and evaluation,” the communiqué stated. It said the council reaffirmed its position that diversification must be given more serious attention and the Economic Sustainability Plan should be faithfully implemented. Copyright PUNCH.
