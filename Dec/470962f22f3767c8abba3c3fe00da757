Temiloluwa O’Peters The Central Bank of Nigeria has warned that neither Azimo nor Transfer Wise has been licensed by the bank to operate as International Money Transfer Operators. CBN in a disclaimer posted on its twitter account on Wednesday notified the public that the companies were transacting business, unauthorised as IMTOs in Nigeria and therefore warned potential investors to beware of the companies. The apex bank advised the public to desist from patronising the schemes, noting that doing so was at the investor’s peril. The statement said, “The attention of the Central Bank of Nigeria has been drawn to the activities of Messrs Azimo and Messrs Transfer Wise, both of which are purportedly transacting business, albeit unauthorised, as International Money Transfer Operators. “The bank wishes to notify the general public that neither Messrs Azimo nor Messrs Transfer Wise is licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria to operate as an International Money Transfer Operator. “The public is therefore advised to beware of the activities of Messrs Azimo and Messrs Transfer Wise and desist from patronising the companies forthwith. Anyone who patronises the unregistered companies does so at his or her own risk.” Copyright PUNCH.
