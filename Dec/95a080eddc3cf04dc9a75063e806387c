John Charles Makurdi Hundreds  of people on Monday who thronged  the Akper Aku Stadium, Makurdi  Benue State capital,  expecting a reward for their investment were disappointed. The people who went to the stadium from different parts of the state as early as 6am had come to receive items for Christmas from a Ponzi scheme, known as Inksnation. It was gathered that the people had registered with N2,000 each and were to receive  N12,000 in three instalment in cash or consumables for their investment. The investors were reportedly directed to assemble at the stadium to collect their reward but, no official of the purported investment scheme came and no explanation was given. A victim, Ayua Tondo, told our correspondent that he had come to the stadium to N4,000 worth of items. According to him, there was no word from the Inksnation, adding that after queuing for a long period under the sun, it became obvious that they had been scammed. “It’s actually an online investment platform. I paid N2,000 to Inksnation and we were told to gather at the stadium today for our reward of N12,000 cash or consumables such as rice, indomie. We have been here since 6am but nothing to show for it. Another victim, who gave her name as Ele Jonah,  said, “Just imagine the crowd inside the stadium and more people are outside. We had hope that Inksnation will make us enjoy a better Christmas but that hope has been dashed.” Copyright PUNCH.
