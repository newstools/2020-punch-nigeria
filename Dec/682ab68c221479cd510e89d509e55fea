Segun Adewole A former Director of the Department of State Services, Mike Ejiofor, has urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to change the service chiefs. Ejiofor, who stated this while speaking on Channels Television on Monday, said changing the service chiefs, military tactics, equipment and approaches would lead to progress in the fight against insecurity. “I expect that Mr President should take Nigerians by surprise, change the service chiefs,” the former DSS director said while urging Nigerians to change their attitude to security agencies. “By the change of tactics, equipment, attitude, service chiefs, and approaches, we’ll make some progress, I believe that very strongly,” Ejiofor added.

He had said, “I am not aware that the tenure of service chiefs is subjected to any law or regulation that is clearly stated. They serve at the pleasure of the president and (if) the president is satisfied with their performance, he keeps them. The buck stops on his table —with due respect to the feelings of Nigerians. “The clamour for the sack is out of place considering that the president is not subject to the opinion of opposition political party which has clamoured for this all the time. It is entirely his own determination; he decides who he keeps as his service chiefs and for how long.”
