Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri Members of the Imo State Assembly on Tuesday approved a request by the state governor, Hope Uzodinma, for a six-tenure extension for the Interim Management Committee Chairmen of the 27 Local Government Areas of the State. Speaker of the House, Paul Emeziem, had read a letter written by the governor seeking approval to extend the tenure of the chairmen during plenary. In the letter, the governor had explained that the tenure extension would assist his administration to deliver on its campaign promises especially those made to the people at the grassroots. After reading the letter, the Speaker subjected the request to a voice vote which was overwhelmingly approved. The governor had in April appointed IMC Chairmen for the LGA administration, a decision that pitched him against the LGA Chairmen elected during the administration of the former governor of the State, Rochas Okorocha.
