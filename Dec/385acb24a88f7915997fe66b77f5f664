Kayode Oyero The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), on Thursday, said the many successes of the Nigerian Military in peacekeeping missions in many West African countries have helped to project Nigeria as a reliable regional power. He stated this on Thursday during the Induction Ceremony of MI-171 Combat Helicopter And Commissioning Of Reactivated L-39ZA Aircraft by the Nigerian Air Force. Buhari, who joined the ceremony virtually from the Aso Villa in Abuja, said the Air Force has contributed greatly in neutralising bandits and terrorists in the North-East and North-West parts of the country. He said, “It is on record that these additional platforms have contributed immensely to the Air Force efforts against insurgents and armed bandits in recent engagements. “Our Air Force since its establishment in 1964 has been playing critical roles in national security as well as in peacekeeping operations on the African continents. “Our country’s efforts in internal security and peacekeeping missions in places like The Gambia, Guinea Conakry, Mozambique, Liberia, Sierra Leonne, Mali, Guinea Bissau and Cameroon, has only been a source of pride to us as a nation but has also projected us as a reliable regional power that has helped stabilised other nations and stood firm in the defence of democracy.”
