Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin Kidnappers, who abducted a couple at Ewatto in the Esan South East Local Government Area of Edo State, have demanded N15m ransom for their release. Mr and Mrs Paul Aluola were kidnapped by armed men on Monday. Paul is said to be a teacher at the Iriwa Primary School, Ohordua, while his wife is a petty trader. A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed that the kidnappers had called the couple’s family members for ransom, adding, “They are currently demanding N15m as ransom before releasing their victims. “The family members are wondering how a teacher can raise such an amount of money.” It was learnt that the couple were travelling on the Ewatto-Ubiaja Road and had approached the bridge on the Ellah River when the gunmen opened fire on the vehicle conveying them and forced it to stop. The kidnappers then dragged the victims out of the vehicle and took them into the bush. Academic activities at the Iriwa Primary School were reportedly paralysed on Tuesday due to the incident. When contacted, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Johnson Kokumo; and the Police Public Relations Officer, SP Chidi Nwabuzor, did not take their calls. Copyright PUNCH.
