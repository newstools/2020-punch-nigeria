Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta Men of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested a Lagos-based car wash operator, Idris Ayotunde, after he absconded with his customer’s car. He was said to have fled with the car to Ogun State. The OND holder from a polytechnic in one of the South-West states, reportedly started the car wash business at Jimoh bus stop, Shasha, Akowonjo, Lagos State, a few months ago. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed these in a statement on Sunday. The PPRO said the car owner took it for vacuum cleaning and handed over the key to the suspect. “Since he did not have vacuum cleaner in his car wash, he decided to take it to another car wash nearby. But he changed his mind on the road and bolted away with the car. “It was on his way to Ibadan where he intended to dispose the car that he was arrested. “The owner of the car, Mrs Shofidiya Tosin, who reported the case at the Shasha Police Station, has been contacted,” Oyeyemi added.
