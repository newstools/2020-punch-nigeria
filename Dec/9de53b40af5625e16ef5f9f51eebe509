John Alechenu, Abuja Amid fears of a possible resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria, the Proprietor of the Las Vegas Pain Institute and Medical Centre in the United States, Dr. Godwin Maduka, has advised the Federal Government to support local research initiatives into tropical diseases and other viral infections. At a news conference on Saturday in Abuja, Maduka lamented the worsening state of health care in the country, noting that Nigeria must develop its capacity to respond to future pandemics. He said, “Health care in Nigeria is something we have to take very seriously. For that to happen, we need to go into research in terms of the tropical diseases and viral infections as we have seen with the COVID-19 so that in future if something like this happens, we will not be caught napping as experienced recently which caused a lot of panic among the populace. “It is about time we put our heads together and changed the direction of health care not just in Anambra but in the whole of Nigeria. That was why we put up a 17-storey building to be able to conduct research and training of health workers. It might not be a hospital for everybody but those diseases which need experts from all over the world to work there. We already built hospitals to take care of the local community. “I am calling on the Federal Government to assist us in our quest to build a research hub, just like you have Cleveland clinic in America which they use for research. Our health care delivery is not at par with the rest of the world and the time has come to revolutionise the sector to reduce dependency on other countries”.
