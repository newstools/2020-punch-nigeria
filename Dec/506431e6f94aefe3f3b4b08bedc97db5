Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The Kogi State Independent Electoral Commission has declared candidates of the All Progressive Congress in all 21 local government areas of the state, winners of the chairmanship elections held on Saturday. Turn out for the election was low but largely peaceful with no incident of violence reported. The state chairman of KSIEC, Mamman Eri, while announcing the results on Sunday said the APC won in all the 21 local government councils. He also said the APC equally won “the entire 239 councillorship seats across the state.” He described the polls as “free, fair and credible.” However, the Kogi State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, described the polls as a sham and a mockery of democracy. The Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr. Bode Ogunmola, said in a statement, on Sunday said, “There was no election anywhere in Kogi State. I was at 002 Open space voting unit in Ogori, and there was no sign of any voting anywhere. Reports reaching me from across the state are the same. This is a big disgrace to our state again under the APC-led government.” He further alleged that thugs loyal to the ruling party invaded the headquarters of the Kogi State Independent Electoral Commission on Friday night to snatch ballot boxes which they took to an unknown destination to commit electoral fraud. State chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Alhaji Muktar Atimah, also spoke in a similar fashion at a media briefing in Lokoja, on Sunday. He described the exercise as a sham. Copyright PUNCH.
