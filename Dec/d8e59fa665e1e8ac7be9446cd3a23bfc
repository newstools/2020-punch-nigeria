Tony Okafor, Awka The founder of Rhema Deliverance Mission, Bishop Arthur Nwachukwu, is dead. It was gathered that the bishop passed away around 3 am on Monday at the age of 79 in his house at Umunya in the Oyi Local Government Area of Anambra State. His son, Ejike Nwachukwu, disclosed this to journalists in Awka, Anambra State. Ejike said, “He (the Bishop) was once sick, but he recovered. Though he had told us that after Christmas, he would like to go home and rest as he would not like to be sick to the point of being a burden to anyone. “We didn’t understand what he meant, so we didn’t take him seriously because he was not sick, but by 3 am today (Monday), he breathed his last. He has gone to be with his maker,” Ejike said. Bishop Nwachukwu hailed from Umunya in the Oyi Local Government Area of Anambra State.
