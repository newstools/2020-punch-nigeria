Emmanuel said this while speaking with chapel heads and officials of the state chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, in Uyo, on Tuesday. He said, “We are making efforts to ensure timely completion of projects; therefore, I am not going to be distracted on the issue of succession plan, only God can decide who succeeds me in 2023. “There is no intention of imposing a surrogate; rather i will focus on my administration’s blueprint and bring more meaningful developments to the state. “As soon as I leave as Governor, I would not rule for a third term through a stooge, I will leave with my I-phone and laptop. So, people should be patient and God alone will produce the next Governor for the state.” He also spoke on the ongoing projects saying instead of rushing over a project that could portend danger for Akwa Ibom people in the immediate future, he was determined to leave a legacy that would stand the test of time.
