The NSE, in its domestic and foreign portfolio report, said foreign inflows into the market fell to N226.13bn year-to-date from N 397.44bn in 2019.

The Head of Macroeconomic Research at EFG Hermes, Mohamed Basha, said the scarcity of foreign exchange in Nigeria was making foreign investors wary of sending their money to the country. Basha noted that Nigeria’s economy faced a very tough 2020, suffering from a double whammy of collapse in oil prices and pandemic shock, which weighed heavily on the country’s fiscal position and real economy. “FX shortages emerged, with a parallel market that’s trading at a +20 per cent premium to official rates; fiscal space was eaten up and the economy fell into recession,” he said in a note. He noted that inflation had accelerated to nearly three-year high, driven mostly by food prices in a further blow to already weak purchasing power. Basha said, “Going into 2021, we see the macroeconomic situation remaining challenging, notwithstanding some improvements. “The recovery in oil prices to $50 per barrel already by end of 2020 and prospects for a slightly higher price in 2021 is definitely good news for the economy and should help avail more resources for both the government and the Central Bank of Nigeria.” He, however, said despite the higher oil price, the country would still be running thin on forex liquidity, unable to replicate the more relaxed environment which existed back in 2017/18. “Then, the market was relying on carry trade flows – foreign flows into the local debt market – to provide excess liquidity in the system, but this trade now has low prospects of recovery, given the very low level of interest rates the country is now offering in addition to FX shortages which make foreign investors wary of sending their money to Nigeria,” he added. The analyst noted that the Nigerian authorities had taken a number of encouraging reform measures, including the deregulation of domestic fuel prices and naira devaluation. Copyright PUNCH.
