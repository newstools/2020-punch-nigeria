Dayo Ojerinde The Diocesan and Missioner of Lagos Anglican Diocese, Rt. Rev. Humphrey Olumakaiye, has urged Nigerians to support the government to overcome the insecurity challenge. Olumakaiye, in his yuletide statement on Monday, titled, ‘He brought us peace,’ commended the Federal Government for the successful rescue of the Kankara boys. He said, “We can now resuscitate our hope in the overall leadership of our dear nation believing that hope is not lost on the present security challenge. With a concerted effort, the security of our nation will bounce back. We trust God to work through our leaders and all of us to make this Nation a better place. It is, however, important for us as citizens to support the government to achieve the kind of nation we desire. “The Yuletide is here, and a lot of preparation and social gatherings have been set rolling. In this spirit of ebullience, we must not fail to acknowledge the peace Christ brought us at his birth many years ago. He is the only reason we can truly live peacefully with God and man. Jesus Christ is called the Prince of Peace because He restores every broken relationship, provides a well-ordered and balanced life, and offers the assurance of eternal life. “As a Nation, we need Jesus to restore our leaders-followers relationship, government-citizen relationship, so that the platform for a well-ordered and balanced life void of kidnappings, killings, hatred, suicide, terror, plague and bad governance will be achievable with an eternal destiny in view.” Copyright PUNCH.
