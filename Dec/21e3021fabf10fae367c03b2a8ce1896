Nike Popoola The National Pension Commission, on Tuesday, said it was unable to conduct the annual physical verification/enrolment exercise of employees of Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government due to retire from service between January and December 2021. It said this was due to the coronavirus pandemic. PenCom said this in a statement titled ‘Notice on the pre-retirement verification and enrolment of employees of the Federal Government treasury funded Ministries, Departments and Agencies, due for retirement between January and December 2021’. The commission said it was however putting an automated process in place that would ensure seamless conduct of the annual verification/enrolment exercise. According to the statement, this new process has two options for the prospective retirees, namely self-assisted and the Pension Fund Administrator-assisted option. The statement said the self-assisted option entailed a prospective retiree scanning original copies of all relevant documents required for the exercise, and uploading the documents to the enrolment web portal located on the commission’s website. After carrying out this process, it added, the retiree would be required to visit his/her PFA for the verification and validation of the submitted documents. “If a prospective retiree choose the PFA assisted option, he/she is required to initiate and conclude the verification/enrolment process by visiting his/her PFA to verify and validate all relevant original documents to enable the PFA upload these documents to the commission’s enrolment portal on behalf of the prospective retiree,” it said.
