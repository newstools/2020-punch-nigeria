John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party has asked Prof. Ibrahim Magatawa, the Returning Officer in last Saturday’s bye-election in Bakura state constituency of Zamfara State, to step aside over his alleged support for the All Progressives Congress. In a statement signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiya, on Sunday, the PDP said it was alarmed by Magatawa’s open support for the APC. Ologbondiyan said, “The PDP demands the immediate removal of Prof. Magatawa as his embarrassing pronouncement has betrayed a plot to use the planned rerun in 14 polling units where election was cancelled under unclear circumstances, to rob our party of victory in the Bakura state constituency bye-election. “Our party and Nigerians were shocked when, in declaring the election inconclusive, given that the total number of registered voters in the 14 polling units is 11,439 higher than the 2,181 difference between the 18,645 votes scored by the PDP and 16,464 votes garnered by the APC, Prof. Magatawa openly suggested that the rerun will give the APC an upper hand.” The PDP noted that Prof. Magatawa’s statement exposes his partisanship and undermines confidence in the process. The statement further read, “Moreover, Prof. Magatawa’s comments raise apprehension that elections in the 14 units were cancelled to achieve a sinister design to rob the PDP of its victory. “We however call on INEC to stop using individuals like Prof. Magawata in our elections. He has shown to be a biased umpire who could not even hide his abominable enterprise.” Copyright PUNCH.
