Kayode Oyero All Progressives Congress chieftain, Bola Tinubu, on Saturday, said the release of over 300 schoolboys abducted from Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State, vindicated the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Tinubu made this known in a statement today titled, ‘Lauding Pres. Buhari, Gov. Masari over Rescue of Kankara Schoolboys’. He said, “The initial abduction of the over 300 Kankara schoolboys from their dormitory in broad daylight was unsettling and raises serious concern. However, their prompt rescue from their abductors is heart-warming. “It vindicates President Buhari in his untiring commitment and determination to rid the country of insecurity and confront Boko Haram insurgents and bandits operating in some parts of the country.” The former governor of Lagos State also applauded Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari, and men of Armed Forces for “bringing the boys back home”. He further said, “This laudable effort must be sustained. We must all do more to tackle the evil-doers and see the back of the Boko insurgents and bandits. “We need to upgrade our security infrastructure and re-strategise. The armed forces themselves must renew their efforts to make not only our schools safe for students but also our cities and villages. “No development can occur in a climate of fear, uncertainty, and insecurity of lives and property.” The APC chieftain also “empathise with the agonised parents and relations of the abducted schoolboys and rejoice with them over the release of their children from the jaws of the abductors”. Gunmen on motorcycles had attacked the school on December 11 and abducted the students after a gun duel with the police. The abduction occurred some hours after the President arrived in Daura, Katsina for a week-long private visit. Masari, however, announced on December 17 that 344 schoolboys were released by bandits in Zamfara State.
