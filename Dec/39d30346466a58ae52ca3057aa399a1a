John Alechenu, Abuja The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, has urged Nigerians to use 2021 to save Nigeria. He said this in a statement titled, ‘We must save our democracy and Nation in 2021’, signed by his Media Adviser, Ike Abonyi, in Abuja, on Thursday. The statement quoted Secondus as urging Nigerians to put all hands on deck in the new year to save our democracy and the nation from destruction. According to him, the call has become necessary as it’s now very oblivious that the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC, under the watch of President Muhammadu Buhari is grossly incapacitated to lift the country out of the woods. The statement read in part, “The destruction done to this country in the 67 months of the reign of President Buhari and his APC, can only be restored if all patriots irrespective of leanings rise to the challenge by putting their differences aside for the nation. “What is obvious is that this regime cannot help this country again having lost the goodwill of the people and yet not possessing the needed capacity to confront the myriads of challenges on the ground.” The PDP chairman noted that one special ingredient of democracy is freedom of speech and association and warned that any attempt through any means to curtail free speech in the country will be unacceptable and should be resisted. Prince Secondus said that while it’s not arguable that democracy remains the best form of government for the country, there is ample room for improvement and the new year provides an opportunity for the ruling party and the legislators to take necessary and urgent steps to deepen our democracy.
