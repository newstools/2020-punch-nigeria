Abiodun Nejo Former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, has expressed confidence that the All Progressives Congress will resolve the issue of the zone to produce its 2023 presidential candidate in no distant time. Shettima, who dismissed insinuations that the matter of presidential candidate would tear the party apart, said the APC as “a strongly- bonded and cohesive political family,” would not disintegrate or be divided over the presidential ticket. The APC chieftain, who spoke to journalists on the sidelines of a two-day high-level retreat for top functionaries of Ekiti State Government in Ado Ekiti on Friday, said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), and party leaders would ensure resolution of the zoning issue. The senator said, “Don’t forget that our party still controls the Presidency. We have a leader and other competent leaders who can manage every crisis situation. At the appropriate time, our leaders will sit and take the most apt decision that will resolve the issue. “The APC is a party that is united. Nothing can break us. I am confident that we will win the 2023 presidential election, because of the unity of purpose and desire to deliver for Nigerians. So, I am confident and there is no cause for alarm. What you call ‘controversy’ will be resolved at the right time.” Fayemi had organised the retreat with the theme, ‘Finishing well and sustaining progressive leadership in Ekiti State,’ for top state officials to assess his administration in the last two years and reflect on how the government could improve on service delivery and governance to ensure a more impactful outcome.
