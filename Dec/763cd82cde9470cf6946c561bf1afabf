Dayo Ojerinde The Onibudo of Aiyetoro-Budo, Aiyetoro, Ogun State, Oba Adewunmi Odutala, has advised Nigerians to pray against a bloody revolution in 2021, saying the country is sitting on a keg of gunpowder. Odutala spoke on Sunday on the sidelines of an annual festival of praise, tagged, ‘King of Kings,’ held at his palace in Aiyetoro, Ogun State. He said, “People are suffering; the youth are angry, and when the youth are angry, the country is on fire. Things are not moving fine, many graduates are out there without jobs. Nigeria can be better than this, we have all it takes. “We must pray for Nigeria so that there won’t be a negative intervention in government. There is revolution at the backdoor of this country; we must pray for Nigeria and Nigerians. The government must take proactive measures to protect lives. “We are enjoying this democracy, no matter how good a military government can be, one cannot compare it with democracy.” Copyright PUNCH.
