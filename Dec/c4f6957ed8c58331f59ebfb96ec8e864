Tunde Oyekola Ilorin The Federal Polytechnic, Offa, Kwara State, has expelled a Higher National Diploma 1 student, Oladipo Opeyemi, after he was convicted of Internet fraud by the Kwara State High Court sitting in Ilorin last Thursday. The court sentenced 23-year-old Opeyemi to nine months’ imprisonment with an option of fine of N250,000. In a statement, the polytechnic’s Director of Public Relations and Protocol, Olayinka Iroye, said the students’ disciplinary committee recommended Opeyemi of the Business Administration Department for expulsion. The statement read, “The management of the polytechnic expelled him from the institution following the students’ disciplinary committee’s reports which equally found him guilty of the offence, though he pleaded for leniency. “The offence violates the polytechnic’s code of conduct as clearly stated in the students’ Information and Regulations Handbook Section 18.2.1 Subsection (ix). “The management strongly uses this medium to uphold its stand against cyber and Internet fraud, cultism, hooliganism and other social vices, and will not hesitate to sanction appropriately erring students in accordance with the polytechnic’s rules and regulations. “Students are therefore enjoined to be of good behaviour and conduct themselves accordingly.” Copyright PUNCH.
