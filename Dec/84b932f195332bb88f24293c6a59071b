Olushola Odeyinde Lauretta Onochie, Senior Special Assistant on Social Media to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has urged Nigerians to show patriotism despite the many challenges confronting the country. Onochie appealed to Nigerians who ‘hate’ the President to be careful not to extend the same ‘hatred’ to Nigeria and her institutions, warning that such disposition may be inimical to the development of the country. The President’s aide made this plea in a two-part tweet on Wednesday. “If you choose to hate our President and Legislators, it’s okay but that hatred must not be extended to Nigeria and her institutions,”@Laurestar wrote.
