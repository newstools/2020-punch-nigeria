Kayode Oyero Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has urged Lagosians to give up all gatherings associated with Christmas celebrations. The governor, in a message to Lagosians on Christmas Day, said the restraint was necessary to curb the spread of the coronavirus amid the second wave of the pandemic. Sanwo-Olu, who just recovered from the novel virus, said, “I wish all Lagosians a very happy and joyful Christmas on behalf of my family and the government of Lagos State. “It is a fact that this year’s celebration is an unusual one, where we are expected to cut back on the usual and age-long tradition of family get-togethers and visits to friends and loved ones because of the pandemic that has spiked in recent days. “The lesson of Christmas in itself is one of love and sacrifice by our Lord, Jesus Christ. We are to demonstrate this love for one another by ensuring we observe all the COVID19 safety protocols so we do not spread the virus. “This yuletide season will demand that we give up all acts that can increase community spread of the virus – by not hosting and attending events that will breach safety protocols. “By the grace of God, we will have more Christmas celebrations in good health and more prosperity in the years to come.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that the governor on Friday advised religious leaders in the state to suspend Crossover Services on December 31, 2020. Lagos, which is one of the epicentres of coronavirus management in Nigeria, has recorded over 26,000 infections and more than 200 associated deaths since the outbreak of the virus in the country.
