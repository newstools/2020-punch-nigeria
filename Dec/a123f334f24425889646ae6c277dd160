Eniola Akinkuotu,  Abuja The Federal Government on Wednesday continued its clampdown on #ENDSARS protesters by refusing to issue a passport to a caterer who provided food to protesters and helped in sourcing funds for a wounded protester. The caterer,  Mosopefoluwa Odeseye, whose account had been frozen by the Central Bank of Nigeria in October, was also denied a passport by the Nigeria Immigration Service on Wednesday. Odeseye said in a tweet that she had gone to renew her passport at the Alausa Passport Office, Lagos, but was informed that she had been blacklisted and was asked to proceed to Abuja. She tweeted, “First, it was Central Bank locking up all my bank accounts, now it is Nigerian immigration not issuing my passport at Alausa! To what end, Nigeria? To what end? I applied for a re-issue at Alausa, captured some days ago, and asked to come to pick today then I’m told that I have been blacklisted?” Attempts to speak with the spokesman for the NIS, Mr. Sunday James, proved abortive as he did not respond to a telephone call.

We are only acting on instruction,” she said. The CBN had in October asked banks to freeze accounts of some persons involved in controlling #EndSARS funds. The bank had told a Federal High Court that they are under investigation for terrorism, an allegation they have all denied. The #EndSARS protests, which rocked the nation in October, were later hijacked by hoodlums leading to deaths and destruction of properties. The police and other security agencies have subsequently placed a ban on protests.
