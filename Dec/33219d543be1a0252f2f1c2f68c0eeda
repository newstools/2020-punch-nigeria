The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has commiserated with Governor Abdullahi Sule and the Nasarawa State chapter of the APC over the killing of the party’s chairman, Mr. Phillip Shekwo. Shekwo was kidnapped in his house and was later killed by his abductors. In an emotional letter to Abdullahi, Tinubu said, Shekwo’s killing was a callous, wicked and dastardly act, adding that neither he or anyone deserved to be killed in such a gruesome manner. The letter read in part, “I commiserate with you and the government of Nasarawa State. I hope and pray that security agents will get to the bottom of this horrid killing and bring the perpetrators to book. “My hearts also go out to the family of the deceased, the immediate-past governor of Nasarawa State, Alhaji Tanko Al-Makura, and the teeming APC members in the state,”
