Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia Abia State Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, has signed the 2021 Appropriation Bill into law at the Aba Government lodge. The Bill which was passed by the Abia State House of Assembly earlier today was presented to the Governor by the Clerk of the House, Sir John Pedro Irokansi, in his Aba Lodge where he endorsed the N131,852,752,000.00 Budget made up of N69bn for capital expenditure and N62.8bn for recurrent expenditure. Ikpeazu had on December 7, 2020, presented the budget christened Budget of Local Contents and Sustainable Development to the state House of Assembly. The budget, which is 21.12 per cent higher than last yearâ€™s appropriation, Ikpeazu explained, was inspired by the quest to reinvent the Abia spirit of industry and ingenuity and stimulate industrialisation through the establishment of Cottage Industries in the 17 council areas of the state. It is expected that the budget would help to rejig agencies of government to ensure they become more productive, coordinate effective delivery of services to Abia people, and interpret the vision of delivering multi-sectoral growth across the state.
