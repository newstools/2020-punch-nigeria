Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Department of Petroleum Resources said on Friday that it had sealed a filling station in Rivers State over the quality of product it dispensed, while seven unlicensed Liquefied Petroleum Gas refilling plants were shut. DPR Zonal Controller, Port Harcourt Zonal Office, Bassey Nkanga, disclosed this to newsmen at the end of a two-day meeting with petrol and gas station owners and other stakeholders in the downstream sector held in Port Harcourt. Nkanga said the department would not compromise standards, saying the filling station located in Aluu, Ikwerre Local Government Area of the state was shut following a tip-off from a customer whose car developed a fault after purchasing product there. “There is a station now in Aluu that is shut down because one of the products they are selling does not meet our specifications and a good Nigerian called us because his vehicle had problem. “We rushed to shut down the station and we have concluded our investigations and working to see how we can make sure that that particular specification is corrected. If possible the station will go back to business if not it will remain shut,” he stated. He said the seven facilities were shut during a recent enforcement by its officials, pointing out that the DPR was committed to preventing loss of lives and property from fire or explosions.
