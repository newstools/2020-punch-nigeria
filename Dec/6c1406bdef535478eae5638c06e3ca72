HINDI LIVINUS Poor subsistent farmers in Adamawa State are clamouring for the use of genetically modified pod borer- resistant cowpeas released in the country as Sampea 20-T in December, 2019. Following the introduction and successful pilot trial of PBR cowpea, developed by the Institute of Agricultural Research, Samaru, Zaria, Kaduna State, with funding from African Agricultural Technology Fund, farmers in Adamawa have called on the Federal Government to make available the genetically modified cowpea seeds in commercial quantity for use by farmers in next year’s planting season. They said the modified cowpeas out-performed other local varieties planted by farmers in the four council areas of Gombi, Guyuk, Jada and Maiha in the state, where the successful pilot trial of  the bean developed by the IAR. One of the farmers in Guyuk, Eriyina Joseph, said, unlike the old variety they were accustomed, to the PBR cowpea required less use of pesticide. Another farmer, Yakubu Arhyel, who also took part in the trial of GM seeds, urged the authorities to make the seeds available in commercial quantity, as an important cash crop. AATF Programme officer (Sampea 20-T, PBR Cowpea), Ijeoma Akaogu, said the legume was resistant to the pod-borer insect (Maruca Virtas), early maturing and drought tolerant. Copyright PUNCH.
