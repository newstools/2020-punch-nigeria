John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party, has cautioned the leadership of the House of Representatives against issuing threats to its caucus over its legitimate call for the impeachment of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). This was contained in a statement titled: “Impeachment: Chinda’s Call Is Legitimate, Says PDP… Cautions Reps Leadership Over Threats to Caucus Leader,” signed by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, on Monday. The statement read in part, “The PDP has cautioned the leadership of the House of Representatives for threatening the PDP Caucus leader, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, for making a legitimate, valid and patriotic call for the Impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari over his failure to secure our  nation. “For the avoidance of doubts, Hon. Chinda is the leader of the PDP Caucus in the House of Representatives and his call is not only constitutional but also aptly represents the opinion of our caucus, our party, the PDP, as well as the generality of Nigerians, including those who have fallen victim of President Buhari’s ineptitude to secure our nation. “This threat to Hon. Chinda is therefore a direct signal that the current leadership of the House of Representative is not on the side of the people but has been cowed to relinquish its statutory legislative powers for selfish reasons.” Copyright PUNCH.
