Joseph Olaoluwa The National Union of Air Transport Employees is seeking for negotiation with the management of Arik Air staff following the sack of 300 workers. Arik Air on Friday relieved 300 employees of their appointments, citing the decision on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on its operations. The statement titled, “Arik Air management declares 300 staff redundant,” explained that a redundancy package would be provided for the affected members with the help of the aviation unions. The General Secretary, NUATE, Aba Ocheme, in an interview with our correspondent said the decision was not a bad one if the relieved workers could walk away with huge packages at the planned negotiation scheduled for Monday. He said, “I understand that when people hear redundancy, it can sound sad but it is not really a sad development from our point of view. ‘What Arik has done is to declare its intention to do a headcount reduction by 300. “At the first instance, it may be more than that at the end of the day.  It is not a sad situation because instead of workers continuing in the struggle, they may opt for a reasonable pay-off and be happy to leave instead of struggling with every situation at the workplace.” He added, “Our union has welcomed that declaration. Our intention is to get a fair deal for those who are leaving. The workers themselves have embraced that declaration and their only wish is a fair deal. If we get a fair deal, we have a win-win situation.” Ocheme said the union had requested that the matter of terminal benefits and Conditions of Service be settled because of its role when appointments are terminated. He further explained that the strike has been suspended in view of a meeting on Monday. Copyright PUNCH.
