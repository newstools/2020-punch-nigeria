Leke Baiyewu, Abuja An Ondo State member of the House of Representatives, Tajudeen Adefiyose, has defected from the Social Democratic Party to join the All-Progressives Congress. Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, read Adefisoye’s letter of defection during plenary on Wednesday. In the letter, Adefisoye said in part, “My decision to quit the SDP was informed by the irreconcilable leadership crisis within the party. The protracted leadership crisis has manifested in the plethora of ongoing court cases as well as multiple factions of the party that have surfaced at the national level and the Ondo State chapter of the party.” Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, who raised a point of order, noted that Adefisoye was not in the chamber as Gbajabiamila read his letter of defection.
