Kayode Oyero Lauretta Onochie, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Social Media, says her principal, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), is delighted over the release of hundreds of schoolboys abducted from Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State. “Mr. President receives the joyful and delightful news of the release of the students of Kankara School,” @Laurestar tweeted shortly after the Katsina State Government announced the release of the students. Governor Aminu Masari said the boys were at Tsafe, Zamfara State, and would be transported to Kankara on Friday. He was said to have called the President to inform him of the development. Also, a presidential media aide, Garba Shehu, tweeted, “President Muhammadu Buhari has welcomed release of kidnapped students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State, describing their safe return as a big relief to their families, the entire country and international community.” Gunmen had invaded the school premises last Friday and abducted over 300 students after a gun duel with the police. The abduction took place some hours after the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), arrived in Daura, Katsina for a week-long private visit. Leader of terror group Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, later released two video footage claiming responsibility for the dastardly act. The Defence Headquarters, however, discredited the claim, insisting the act was carried out by bandits.
