Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The lawmaker representing Obio/Akpor Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Kingsley Chinda, says the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (rtd.), lacks the capacity to tackle the insecurity currently plaguing the country. Chinda stated this while speaking at the grand finale of the sensitisation and verification of wards and local government area offices of the Grassroots Development Initiative, a pro-PDP group held in Obio/Akpor, Rivers State. Chinda explained that his call for Buhari’s impeachment was not out of hatred or anything personal but was for the best interest of Nigerians. “We do not hate Mr. President. He has done nothing personal to us but we are saying that Mr. President is not fit for purpose. “If we look at our country and we do nothing and keep quiet because we are afraid or because we want to please people. By the time this country collapses, we will have no other country to go to,” he said.
