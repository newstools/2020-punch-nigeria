Gbenga Odogun The Special Committee on Judiciary Staff Verification Exercise in Kogi State has discovered the names of dead staff members and retirees on the monthly payroll of both the judiciary and Judicial Service Commission. The Chairman of the committee, Ibrahim Alhassan, who stated this while submitting the report and recommendations to the acting Chief Judge of Kogi State, Justice Henry Olusiyi, on  the premises of the High Court of Justice in Lokoja, blamed the administrative department for improper documentations of staff records, saying many frauds were revealed. Alhassan noted that some of the records from the administrative department were “incongruent” and made the exercise more tedious than expected. He said lapses were discovered in the Personnel Department on improper documentation of staff information and job description within the terms of reference, which he said contributed to a lot of administrative lapses in the system. On the outcome of the report, the committee chairman noted the discovery of some retired and deceased staff whose names were still on the payroll. He lamented that some top officials of the judiciary and the Judicial Service Commission, who had since taken their oath of office and assumed office, did not have clear records of the employment in the administrative department. According to him, the fate of numerous staff who obtained employment through the back door hangs in the balance as they await the report of the committee, which came in two volumes. The committee chairman stressed that aside from the exercise taking place at the headquarters, the committee also visited 39 directorates to carry out the verification exercise. Copyright PUNCH.
