Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority, Hadiza Bala Usman, told the Senate on Monday that the agency lost more than one billion naira when some unidentified people vandalised its facilities during the recent #EndSARS protests in October this year. She spoke during the 2021 budget defence session of her agency before the Senate Committee on Marine Transport. The NPA boss explained that the N807m had been earmarked for rehabilitation of the burnt portion of the agency’s building. She said the burnt portion was different from the amount that would be spent to replace the 27 vehicles set ablaze by the vandals while three others were stolen. “The operational vehicles needed to be replaced as soon as insurance companies come up with the aspect of losses to be shouldered. “Apart from burnt building and vehicles, other working tools like 317 computers were looted as well as photocopiers. “The cost of replacing all the burnt and vandalised items will be above a billion naira when added to the N807m already estimated for rehabilitation of the burnt section of the building.” She, however, assured the committee that the agency, based on ongoing arrangement with the Lagos State Government and the National Inland Waterways Authority would come up with lasting solution to trucks gridlock on roads leading to the ports in Lagos.
