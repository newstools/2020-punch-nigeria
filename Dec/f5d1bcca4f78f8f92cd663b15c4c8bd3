Tukur Muntari, Kano THE Kano State branch of the Nigeria Labour Congress, has called on Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to stop further deductions of workers’ salaries and pensioners’ allowances. The NLC State Chairman, Kabiru Ado Minjibir made the call in a telephone interview with The PUNCH in Kano on Wednesday. “We strongly rise against the deduction of workers’ salaries by the Kano State Government with no reason given or without giving notice. Recall that the Kano State Government had for the fourth time last month (November) deducted from civil servants’ salaries and pensioners allowances without notification or giving reason for the deduction. Minjibir said any further deductions of workers’ salaries would not be tolerated, as the union would take all the necessary legal means to stop it. The NLC boss also urged all its affiliate unions and state branches to resist any salary deduction in December salaries. He lamented that the state government had yet to refund the salaries of workers it deducted for three months after it started the implementation of N30,600 minimum in December 2019. Copyright PUNCH.
