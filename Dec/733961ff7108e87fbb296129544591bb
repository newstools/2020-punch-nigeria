Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Mr. Raufu Olaniyan, has disowned 2023 governorship campaign posters purportedly issued on his behalf. He described those behind the campaign as political jobbers and enemies of progress who were bent on causing disaffection between him and his principal, Governor Seyi Makinde. Campaign posters, bearing inscriptions such as: ‘Enough is enough,’ Oke Ogun L’okan,’ meaning: It is the turn of Oke Ogun people’ with the logo of the Peoples Democratic Party, were seen in different parts of the state, on Tuesday. The development came amidst speculations that the relationship between the governor and his deputy is at its lowest ebb. The deputy governor, who hails from Igboho in Oorelope Local Government Area of Oke Ogun, however, denied these claims. He said, “I signed up for a 48 months contract as Governor Seyi Makinde’s deputy. We are not even halfway into that and then they are spreading this speculation like wildfire. Even my belief in God does not allow it. “The poster was not printed in my name. The next stage of their sinister motive is to print posters in my own name. Technology has made printing relatively cheap these days and you can imagine what access such people will have to make as many fake posters as possible. “Those behind this sinister plot have one mission: to sow a seed of discord between me and the governor and drive a wedge between us. But they will fail and they have always failed.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
