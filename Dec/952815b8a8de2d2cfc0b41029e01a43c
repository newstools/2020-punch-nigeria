Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Emmanuel Adebisi, one of the coordinators of #EndSARS Movement in Osun state, on Monday appeared before an Osogbo Magistrate Court on allegations bordering on impersonation. Adebisi, who was dragged before the court by the Department of State Security, for impersonating the Nigerian Army, was subsequently remanded in Custodial Centre. The prosecutor, Ben Nweke, had told the court that Adebisi had claimed to be a ‘Captain’ on some documents and deceived officer of Osun State Public Complaint Commission. Nweke also said the defendant had in his residence located at the Ile-Idande Area, Ayekale, Osogbo, on December 9, 2020, accoutrements of the Armed Forces without a satisfactory account of how he came about the items. The offences committed were said to have contravened Sections 467, S. 484, S.109 and S.428 of the Criminal Code Cap 34 Vol.2, law of Osun state of Nigeria, 2002. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the four counts pressed against him. His lawyer, A.C Olaniyi, moved an oral application for his bail with an assurance that the defendant would not jump bail. In his ruling, the presiding magistrate, F. Omisade, told defence counsel to approach the court with a formal bail application. He ordered that the defendant be remanded in Ilesa Custodial Centre and subsequently adjourned the matter till Monday, December 21.
