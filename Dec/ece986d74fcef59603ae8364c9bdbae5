Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Bayelsa State Police Command has arrested five suspects in connection with the armed invasion of former Governor Seriake Dickson’s Toru-Orua home in the Sagbama Local Government Area of the state. They were among 45 criminal suspects paraded on Monday at the state command headquarters in Yenagoa by the Commissioner of Police, Mr Mike Okoli. A police inspector, who was among officers guarding Dickson’s residence, was killed during the midnight attack on November 18. Okoli claimed that the gang stormed the former governor’s country home in search of money, but when they could not find any, they killed the deceased officer. “I am happy to inform you that at the moment, five suspects connected to that incident are in our net. They confessed clearly that they planned the attack. Criminals will always look for a way out. “They confessed to planning the attack, but that they did not carry it out. So, the question comes up: if you planned the attack and you’re saying you did not carry it out, you’ve got to tell us who carried it out. They will be charged to tell the court what they know about that incident,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
