Kayode Oyero The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has urged the freed schoolboys of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State, not to be discouraged by their abduction. “My dear children, don’t be discouraged with what has happened, give your attention to acquiring knowledge and developing good character, and you will be distinguished in life,” Buhari told the schoolboys when he met with them in Katsina on Friday. The President noted that he was once in a boarding school like them and pointed out that education got him to the position he currently occupies. Gunmen on motorcycles had attacked the school over a week ago and abducted the students. The abduction occurred some hours after the President arrived in Daura, Katsina for a week-long private visit. Terror group, Boko Haram, had released two videos, claiming responsibility for the attack.
