Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, on Monday, urged Ebonyians to desist from abusing themselves, saying this would not take the state to its desired height. This is even as the Governor acknowledged that he took responsibility of the actions of his appointees, adding that he was not ready to sit on judgment with anybody. Umahi stated this while performing the groundbreaking ceremony of the National Affordable Housing Delivery Programme for Nigerian workers in the Ohaozara Local Government Area of the state. Recall that the state had been enmeshed in accusations and counter-accusations following the defection of the governor from the Peoples Democratic Party to the ruling All Progressives Congress, last month. The governor was said not to have consulted critical stakeholders before he dumped the PDP for the APC but wanted them to defect with him. Their refusal to heed Umahi’s call, sources said, had pitched the stakeholders against the governor, ushering in an episode of allegations and naming calling in the state. But speaking on Monday, Umahi ordered his supporters to desist from dirty politics and urged his political friends from the other side of the divide to embrace peace. He said, “I have directed that nobody should abuse anybody again. We should stop it. Even if I am abused, it goes with the job. “Do not abuse anybody; but you can always put any distorted information straight. I am the father of the state and should not allow the state to go into bitterness and disunity. So, I have decided to move forward and I have decided to forgive all and all those who may have been hurt. “This is because I take responsibility for all the actions of my government officials and other supporters, my apologies. I am not going to sit on judgment with anybody; these apologies and forgiveness should be enough to settle all bad blood.”
