Her son-in-law was ‘smart’, ‘mesmerizing with his mind’, and a computer genius, but he was an ‘alcoholic’ who could be ‘an arrogant snob’ and she had witnessed him beating Lilia. ‘My daughter was completely sober,’ she said, claiming the law is biased against victims of domestic abuse in Russia. The model’s friend, stylist Karolina Pavlovskaya, also said Lilia had been a victim of abuse. ‘She was a broken-down girl with a beautiful appearance, but emptiness inside,’ she said. After the stabbing, Lilia immediately called an ambulance, and Popov was rushed to the hospital where he died. She confessed to stabbing her husband of four years with a knife and initially told police it was due to jealousy after he flirted with the woman, according to Russian media. She has been charged with manslaughter and detained in pretrial custody for two months. Lilia faces up to 15 years in jail if convicted.
