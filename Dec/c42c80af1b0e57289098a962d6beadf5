Kayode Oyero Kannywood actress, Rahama Sadau, has described the killings in northern Nigeria by terrorists as “barbarous”. The actress, who made this known in a string of tweets on Tuesday, called on Federal Government and all relevant authorities to rise up to the responsibility of protecting lives and property in the country. @Rahma_sadau wrote, “The insecurity we (are) currently facing in northern Nigeria is uncalled for and should be dealt with immediately. “The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity, but then how do we do serve life when we have lost all sense of humanity? It is barbarous! “I call on relevant authorities to respond and protect us against the increasing number of violence against women and put an end to insecurity in Nigeria.” Sadau had stirred controversy last month for posting a photo of herself on social media wearing a backless dress and not covering her hair in contravention of Islamic canons. Sadau was subsequently banned by the northern movie industry as many northern Islamic elements criticised her and threatened to attack her.
