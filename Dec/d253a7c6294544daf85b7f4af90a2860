Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri The Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, has explained why he commends and criticises the security forces in the frontline of the battle against Boko Haram insurgency in the state. The governor, in a Christmas message by his spokesperson, Mallam Isa Gusau, also asked Nigerians to reflect on how soldiers, the Civilian Joint Task Force, local hunters, vigilantes, and other security forces fighting Boko Haram terrorists would celebrate Christmas. “At the same time, we should ask ourselves how thousands of yet-to-be-resettled internally displaced persons and fellow Nigerians taking refuge in foreign countries are also celebrating the Christmas, lined up for food in camps and host communities,” he said. Calling on the security forces to remain committed to safeguarding lives and property, the governor added, “We will continue to accord far-reaching support to security forces, especially those who have shown their dedication and gallantry. “We will commend and reward, and where there is the need to raise voices of concern, we will do so on behalf of our citizens who we swore to protect. I believe in the carrot and stick approach, and this is based on my personal principles and my training in the academics. “Critical thinking is the foundation of academics, and in this, the philosophy is to look at the opposite sides of every case study. From the academic point of view, there is never one side to any case under study and this is why I commend, I reward, and I also criticise.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
