Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia Governor of Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu has debunked rumours making the rounds that he plans to defect from the Peoples Democratic Party. Speaking during a state radio programme, The Platform, monitored in Umuahia last weekend, Governor Ikpeazu said he has not seen any reason why he should leave the PDP for any other party. Rumours abound that the Abia State chief executive has concluded plans to defect to the All Progressive Congress before the end of the year. However, reacting to a question on the matter during the interview session, the governor said, “I do not see any reason why I should leave the PDP for any other political party. The music of politics as it plays differs from one state to another. Here in Abia, the people are comfortable with the PDP and I think the aspirations of Ndi Abia will be met and achieved under the platform of the PDP”. Continuing, the governor emphasised that “nobody has been able to convince me that there is a better party for us here in Abia than the PDP. I am a strong member of the PDP and a leader in the party. In fact, I am the Deputy Chairman of the PDP Governors’ Forum”. Invariably referring to APC, Ikpeazu said, “I will rather be a conductor in a moving vehicle than be the driver of a stationary vehicle”.
