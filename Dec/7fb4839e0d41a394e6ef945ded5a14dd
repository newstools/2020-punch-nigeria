Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Inisa community in the Odo Otin Local Government Area of Osun State, has been thrown into mourning following the death of the Eesa of Inisa, Chief Enoch Ajiboso. According to sources, Ajiboso slumped at a meeting called to resolve a tussle over who becomes the Chief Imam of Inisa Central Mosque. He was confirmed dead in a hospital. A close friend of the deceased, who sat a few meters away from him at the meeting, Chief Adetoyi Abimbola, told our correspondent that the incident occurred some minutes past 2pm on Sunday. Adetoyi, who is the Otun of Inisa, said, “He kept telling people not to use power to get anything in life. He was never sick. “I sat with him Sunday morning and we discussed some issues. Olunisa and others at the town hall were dazed when he suddenly slumped and was rushed out. His death has created a big vacuum. The town is mourning.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, also confirmed the death. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
