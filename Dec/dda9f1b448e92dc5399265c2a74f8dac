Speaking to reporters at the state APC Secretariat, in Umuahia, on Sunday, the Caretaker Committee chairman, Donatus Nwankpa, said, “The ABSIEC not only displayed incompetence, they also exhibited lack of preparedness. “In most places, in most cases, there were no voting materials, no result sheets, the manpower and the capacity to even conduct the election because there were no preparations to conduct election into the 292 ABSIEC wards and the 17 LGAs which manifested itself yesterday” he said. “Any result not announced at the poll unit is hereby rejected by APC. Until the right thing is done APC will seek redress in court.” However, the chairman of the Abia State Independent Electoral Commission, Prof. Mpka Agu Mkpa who announced the results, commended all parties as well as security agencies for ensuring a smooth exercise.
