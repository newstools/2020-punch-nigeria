Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Abia Onyike, has dumped the ruling party to return to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party. Before his earlier defection to the APC, Onyike was a supporter of the PDP. He once served as Director of Media and Publicity for the Governor David Umahi campaign organisation called the Divine Mandate. He also served as Commissioner for Information and State Orientation. He left the PDP for the APC, in the build up to the 2019 general elections, owing to alleged ill-treatment by the governor. Onyike’s return to the PDP was contained in a statement, titled, ‘Why I am going back to the PDP’, made available to journalists, in Abakaliki, on Thursday. The statement read in part, “After a critical review of the current political scenario in Ebonyi State, especially since November 19, 2020, when Governor David Umahi defected from the PDP to the APC, I, Abia Onyike, have decided to return to the Peoples Democratic Party.
