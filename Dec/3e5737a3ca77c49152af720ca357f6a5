Kayode Oyero Opposition Peoples Democratic Party has urged Nigerians not to be hopeless in the face of economic hardship and insecurity witnessed in the last five years under the administration of the All Progressives Congress. According to PDP, most families have nothing to celebrate with on Christmas Day but all hope is not lost for Nigeria. The party made this known in a statement on Thursday titled, ‘Christmas: PDP Urges Hope, Prayers For Nigeria’. The statement signed by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, partly read, “The PDP stressed that though the manifest failures of the current administration have led to an excruciating widespread economic hardship and worsened insecurity across the country, Christmas rekindles faith that all hope is not lost for our nation. “The PDP laments that under the prevailing circumstances, most families have nothing to celebrate with, many are in deep mourning over their losses from escalated insecurity due to the failure of those entrusted with the leadership of our nation. “Nevertheless, we must keep hope alive and find strength in God’s unfailing intervention as demonstrated with the gift of salvation in the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
