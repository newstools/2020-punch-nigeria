Former France centre Mathieu Bastareaud will miss the rest of the Top 14 season with a knee injury, the Lyon player announced on Monday. “Season over. Now we need to look straight ahead in order to come back in 2021,” the 32-year-old said on Twitter. French media report that Bastareaud, who was capped 54 times and twice captained Les Blues before announcing his retirement from international rugby last year, has suffered a ruptured tendon in his left knee. Bastareaud first signed for Lyon in 2019, returning to the club earlier this year after a brief stint in the United States, and has become a key player for the Top 14 club. He has taken part in every single match Lyon have played so far this season, starting in 10 of their 11 matches. (AFP)
