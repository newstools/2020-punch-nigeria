Wale Oyewale, Ibadan ADUNNI Oseni, an indigene of Oyo State, who was repatriated from Oman to Nigeria, has been reunited with her family, Mrs Tolulope Akande-Sadipe, Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Diaspora, has said. Akande-Sadipe, House of Representatives member from Oluyole Federal Constituency of Oyo State, said the lady, one of her constituents, was repatriated to the country through the Muritala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. According to the National Assembly member, the lady was denied the opportunity to return home by her employers, until intervention was made. It was learnt that the returnee willingly submitted herself to be repatriated to Nigeria due to the inhumane condition that she and many others were subjected to in Oman. Akande-Sadipe, who decried the inhumane treatment being meted on Nigerians in the Arab countries, however, commended NAPTIP for its commitment to duty. She said, “As it stands today, we have over 20,000 Nigerian girls living in tents in Mali, an African country, over 40,000 girls in Lebanon. “We have a responsive 9th Assembly, under Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, which is putting in place right laws that would guide against the incessant occurrences.” Akande-Sadipe noted that some of the agents who traffick out of the country had no license that permits their operations from the Ministry of Labour. In his remarks, the Comptroller, Nigeria Immigration Service, Mr. Abdulahi Usman, advised Nigerians against travelling without proper guidance, noting that Adunni’s case was one out of many cases of deception.
