Joseph Olaoluwa The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority has said that it has reached an agreement with airlines in the country to ensure that debts owed the agency are reconciled and a payment plan is agreed upon. The Director-General, NCAA, Captain Musa Nuhu, said this when the House of Representatives Committee on Aviation led by Nnolim Nnaji paid him a visit on Wednesday. He said, “Under your guidance, we have carried on that agreement that we had. We had a meeting with the operators on the issue of the debt collection and agreed to notify each airline on the level of debt that they have. “We will sit down with them and do the reconciliation. We will then implement a payment plan. We do not expect everyone to pay all their money at a go because of the difficulties in the industry and economic downturn.” He assured that the agreement would be a win-win for all parties by the time it was sorted. Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika had disclosed that the local airlines’ total debt burden to regulatory agencies stood at N22bn in November. The debts were incurred within the period of 10 years.
