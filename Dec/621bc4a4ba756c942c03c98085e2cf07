Tunde Ajaja The Chairman of the Cherubim & Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria, Lagos State chapter, Apostle Joseph Adagba, has asked the Lagos State Government to adequately compensate families of those killed or injured in the state during the #EndSARS protest. The cleric commended the governor for compensating the families of slain policemen lynched during the crisis impasse. He, however, appealed to the government to assist business owners who lost valuables during the protest. Adagba spoke on Friday at the end-of-year Christmas Outreach 2020, with the theme: ‘Peace Be Still’, organised in collaboration between the Lagos State Public Service Christian Fellowship and the Chapel of Christ the Light, Alausa.
