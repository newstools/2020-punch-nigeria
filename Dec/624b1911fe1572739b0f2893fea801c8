Ife Ogunfuwa NACCIMA has commended the decision by Federal Government to reopen four of the country’s land borders at Ilela, Maitagari Seme and Mfum. The chamber in a statement said the decision was a welcome development and an important strategic move as Nigeria strives to exit recession in the first quarter of 2021. The National President, NACCIMA, Hajiya Saratu Aliyu, who signed the statement said the chamber had on several occasions called for the opening of the land borders for numerous reasons, including the negative impact of their closure on the economy since August 2019. Aliyu said, “When hints were given sometime in November by the Minister of Finance that the committee she headed had recommended the opening of these land borders we lauded that move and called for immediate action to that effect. “We are therefore delighted that the President has heeded the call and approved the recommendations to open the borders. As a major economic player in our sub-region, West Africa, this decision will surely help our image and commitment to remain a major economic player in our sub region, West Africa.” She said trade across land borders was an important aspect of business activities of the Small and Medium Enterprises as it would boost export of non-oil products. Aliyu added, “It is a positive decision because trade across our land borders is an important component part of our cross border trade which can help boost operations of many of our SMEs engaged in export of non-oil products through the land borders. “This move is also a welcome strategic move in context of our ratification of the AfCFTA because it is a clear signal of our readiness to effectively trade under the Agreement.
