Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Winner of the Bayelsa West senatorial bye-election and former governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, has said he will pursue issues of restructuring of Nigeria at the National Assembly. He also said that he would focus attention on police, law and order and justice sector reforms. Dickson spoke in his country home of Toru Orua on Sunday, shortly after INEC returned him as winner of Saturday’s bye-election. This was contained in a press statement signed by his media adviser, Fidelis Soriwei, on Monday. The Peoples Democratic Party Senator-elect was quoted as saying his mandate went beyond Sagbama and Ekeremor Local Government Areas, which make up the senatorial district because he equally had a responsibility to galvanise unity in Bayelsa and the entire Ijaw nation. Dickson was quoted as saying, “My legislative mission will focus on the pursuit of the imperative of restructuring of this country, it is a task that must be done. “I will also use the opportunity of my contacts to build new bridges of understanding, consolidation of existing bonds, and effective networking with critical stakeholders.” The former governor further promised to seek the solidarity and support of senators to call attention to what he described as “the mindless rape of the Niger Delta environment by the multinational oil companies.” He assured the people of Bayelsa that he would network with friends and contacts to attract development to the state.
