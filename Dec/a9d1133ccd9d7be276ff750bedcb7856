Temiloluwa O’Peters The Estate Surveyors and Valuers Registration Board of Nigeria has inducted 317 new estate surveyors and valuers into the profession. The Chairman of ESVARBON, Nweke Umezuruike, at the 43rd induction ceremony, noted that the year’s ceremony was special as the number of inductees this year was the most outstanding. He added that it would also be the last ceremony he would preside over as board chairman as he was concluding his tenure. Umezuruike urged the newly registered state surveyors and valuers to observe professional ethics and standards in the cause of their career. He said it would be his delight to watch the inductees move on the right path of professional integrity and urged them to live by the motto of the Nigerian Institute of Estate Surveyors and Valuers, honesty and devotion. “Make integrity your watch word and you will go far in your professional pursuit. You too can reach any height in the profession if you devote yourself to it,” he told them. Delivering his charge to the inductees, the Vice Chairman, ESVARBON, Adamu Kasimu, said the general rules of conduct issued by the board expected that they demonstrate to clients, consumers and the public high degree of honesty, integrity and professional standards that the board proclaimed. He told the new members that being qualified as a real estate valuer and having their firms regulated by the board was basis for market confidence. “Registered persons must demonstrate ethical behaviour, competence, remain solvent and be ready to share credible information with the board in matters of professional significance from time to time,” he added.
