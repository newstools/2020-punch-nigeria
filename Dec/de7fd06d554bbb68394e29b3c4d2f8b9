Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The All Progressives Congress has advised the governorship candidate of the Allied People’s Movement in Ogun State, Adekunle  Akinlade, and all his  followers   to avail themselves of the opportunity provided  by the national directive on membership registration to return to APC and their membership again. The  Ogun state Caretaker Committee Chairman of APC,  Yemi Sanusi, said, “The door is wide open to receive those that left the party in the wake of the 2019 governorship election in the state and welcome them back to their political home.” Sanusi said this on Wednesday at the party’s state secretariat in Abeokuta during the inauguration of the state caretaker committee. The party counsel, Abeeb Ajayi, inaugurated the committee members who included Ayo Okubori (Secretary) and Tunde Okadunjoye (Publicity Secretary)   as directed by the national body. Sanusi said “We have mandate to commence party membership registration and within a short  time,  the caretaker committees  at the local governments and ward levels would be inaugurated. “Our doors are wide open to welcome new members willing to join our party and those who left for another political party. They can come back, register and contribute to move the party forward. New members are to register while old ones are to validate  their membership.” Copyright PUNCH.
