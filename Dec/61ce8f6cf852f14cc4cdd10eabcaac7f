Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has inaugurated its state, local government and ward executive, saying it would win all elective positions in the 2023 general polls. Recall that the party’s National Executive Committee had last week dissolved all structures of the party at the state, local government, ward and unit levels. The party’s national leadership had thereafter inaugurated Mr Isaac Abbot-Ogbobula, to head the leadership of the party in Rivers State on caretaker basis, with a charge to inaugurate new leaders at the various levels. Abbot-Ogbobula, while speaking after the inauguration of other state party executives and the local government chairmen for the 23 LGs in the state, said the party’s decision had put paid to all legal issues against the leadership of the party in the state. Abbot-Ogbobula said the leaders of the party at every level were fresh and were positioned to rebuilding the party ahead of 2023. Abbot-Ogbobula said, “There is no crisis in APC Rivers State. We are together under the leadership of Chibuike Amaechi. We have disagreements here and there but we don’t have crisis. “The party will take over the Rivers State Government House, the Brick House in 2023. The APC will produce the next president of the country come 2023.” Copyright PUNCH.
