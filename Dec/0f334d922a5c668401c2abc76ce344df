Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri A former Senator, Ifeanyi Araraume, has accused the governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma of working against the interest of the All Progressives Congress in the state and in the South East zone. Araraume, who is laying claim to the APC ticket for the just concluded Imo North Senatorial bye-election, said it was time the national leadership of the party cautioned Uzodinma. He alleged that the governor ordered members of the APC to work for the Peoples Democratic Party during the bye-election. Araraume further alleged that Uzodinma did everything to sabotage the APC at the bye-election but his (Araraume) political sagacity made sure that APC won the election. When contacted, the Senior Special Assistant to the governor on Print Media, Modestus Nwamkpa, said that Araraume was telling cheap lies. Meanwhile, APC lawmakers in the state have recommended Ararume’s expulsion from the party over his alleged constant attacks on the state governor. The lawmakers in a communique issued after their caucus meeting, in Owerri, on Monday, said Araraume’s attack on the governor was equally an attack on the APC. The communique reads in parts, “Even as we debunk Sen. Araraume’s claims, we have it on record that it was him (Sen. Araraume), who committed anti party actions by directing his ‘boys’ to vote for PDP, to forestall the victory of APC in the poll. “We also recommend his expulsion as a member of APC because we have noted with confirmation that he is a troublemaker and not the breed we want in the party and also for the growth and progress of APC in Imo State.” Copyright PUNCH.
