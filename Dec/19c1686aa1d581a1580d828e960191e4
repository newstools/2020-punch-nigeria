Friday Olokor, Abuja An international human rights organisation under the aegis of ActionAid Nigeria has raised fears that the COVID – 19 pandemic has worsened the humanitarian crises including hunger, malnutrition and health in the North East. The organisation also said that while over 2.5 million persons in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States have been displaced by Boko Haram insurgency in the last 10 years, over 10.7 million persons required other forms of assistance. ActionAid Manager (Humanitarian and Resilience), David Habba, stated these in an interview with THE PUNCH in Abuja, during a high-level consultative workshop on the Humanitarian Development and Peace Nexus. The programme was organised by AAN in collaboration with Search for Common Ground, the governments of Borno, Adamawa, Yobe and other stakeholders working together to support the implementation of the HDP in the North East region. Habba said while over 2.5 million people had been in need of food assistance because of malnutrition, several others needed help in other areas of human endeavour. He said, “In the crisis situation in the North East, there are challenges of hunger, malnutrition and health. Of course, there are actors working to ensure that we bridge these gaps and these are daily realities of the people in the North East. “We are in a situation of COVID – 19 and the North East is not immune from the virus; COVID – 19 has further worsened the situation of people in the North East and that is a very big challenge.” Copyright PUNCH.
