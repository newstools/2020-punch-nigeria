According to the report, the deficit in the current account also persisted in the third quarter of 2020, while the financial account recorded a net acquisition of financial assets. It stated that the external reserves level at end-September 2020 was $35.96bn, relative to $35.78bn at end-June 2020 and could finance 8.4 months of goods only or 6.9 months of goods and services of import.
