Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt Former Nigeria’s Ambassador to the Netherlands, Orji Ngofa, and a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, Bellor Waite, have disagreed over the performance of the Governor Nyesom Wike- led administration in Rivers State. Ngofa had at a recent All Progressives Congress event in Port Harcourt, where he and some members of the PDP defected to join the All Progressives Congress, said they left the PDP because of bad governance. Ngofa said, the Wike-led administration had failed, saying, “There is no accountability. Other arms of government, legislature and the judiciary have been emasculated by the executive arm of government.” In response, a former Special Adviser to the Rivers State Governor, Bellor Waite, said, “It is quite glaring that Ambassador Ngofa is not fully abreast of recent happenings in Rivers State and the country at large. When he (Ngofa) comes home, one would expect him to apologize to Nigerians for the increase in the unemployment rate and incessant killings in the country where human lives have no value under the leadership of the APC.”
