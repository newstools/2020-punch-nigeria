Dayo Ojerinde A senior nursing officer at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Nneka Nnakwe, has advised Nigerians on the need to live healthy lifestyles to avoid contracting diabetes mellitus. Nnakwe said this at an event organised by Lions club district 404B-2 to commemorate 2020 World Diabetes Day recently. The event was tagged, ‘Let’s walk to stop diabetes.’ She said, “Some risk factors for diabetes include obesity, hypertension and high blood pressure; age is another risk factor too as the disease is common among people from 40 years and above. “Physical and mental stress can also predispose one to have diabetes. People should reduce their consumption of sugar and carbohydrate foods and drinks. We should take more vegetables, water. There is also the need to stress the importance of living an active lifestyle, regular check-ups, visiting the clinic at least once a month to know our sugar level.” The second vice district governor, Mr Lekan Owolabi,the event was organised to educate people on how to prevent diabetes as well as to conduct free screening for the people. “By 2040, it is expected that over 640 million of the world’s adult population may be living with the disease. Although there is no cure some forms of diabetes can be treated. This month, we take a closer look at diabetes highlighting the symptoms, risks, diagnosis and treatment for the disease. “It is a project Lions Club International holds dear to their heart. We will conduct screening and treatment if need be. If the case is severe, we refer them to specialist hospitals. We should take our health seriously we must exercise regularly and watch our lives,” Owolabi said. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
