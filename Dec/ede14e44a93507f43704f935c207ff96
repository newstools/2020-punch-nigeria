Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan Former Osun State Governor, Olagunsoye Oyinlola, on Wednesday led some leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party in the South-West to meet with former Ekiti State Governor, Mr Ayo Fayose. Our correspondent gathered that the meeting, which had a former National Vice Chairman of the PDP on the South-West, Dr Eddy Olafeso, and a former member, Board of Trustees of the PDP, Dr Saka Balogun, was held at  Fayose’s residence in Ibadan. Other PDP leaders who were part of the meeting were  Femi Babalola, Alhaji Adebisi Olopoeniyan; Rev Bunmi Jenyo, as well as some leaders of the party in Ogun, Ekiti and Lagos states:  Dr Sikirulai Ogundele, Otunba Bisi Kolawole, Adedeji Doherty and Sunday Bisi. The South-West chapter of the party has been embroiled in a leadership crisis between Governor Seyi Makinde and Fayose, which has polarised the party between the two leaders. Oyinlola was appointed head of a reconciliation committee by the Makinde-led faction and the committee was derided by the Fayose faction. However, our correspondent gathered that the Wednesday meeting with Fayose was part of the reconciliatory assignment given to Oyinlola. One of the leaders in attendance told our correspondent that the meeting affirmed that Olafeso should be returned as the next national vice chairman of the PDP in the  South-West. They were said to have called on Makinde to support him. Olafeso confirmed the meeting to our correspondent. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
