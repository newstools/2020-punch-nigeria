Tony Okafor, Awka Emeka Ojukwu, the son of the late Igbo leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, has cautioned politicians in Anambra State against using his late father’s image for politics. Ojukwu (jnr) who is a member of the Board of Trustees of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, said, only APGA was authorised to use his father’s images. He said it was because of Ojukwu’s role as the patron saint of the party that APGA remained the only party that could use his images for their activities. He said, “Ezeigbo Gburugburu (the late Ojukwu) is only meant for APGA and that position remains sacrosanct even in death. Let’s respect our late hero, Ikemba Nnewi, by showing respect to his blessed memory. “By showing respect to our heroes, those who have sacrificed for us, we would be respecting ourselves as respect is reciprocal.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
