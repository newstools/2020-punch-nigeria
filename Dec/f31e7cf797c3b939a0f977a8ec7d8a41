Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt A cross-section of Port Harcourt residents in Rivers State on Monday appealed to Governor Nyesom Wike not to lock down the state, but to ban influx of foreigners in order to curb the rise of second wave of COVID-19 in the state. The appeal followed the state governor’s threat on Sunday to impose a fresh lockdown on the state from January 2021 due to rising COVID-19 infections. A Port Harcourt resident, who identified herself as Ibisaki, told our correspondent that restricting travellers into the state would effectively curb the rise of infections than grounding residents’ movement and the state economy. She said, “The governor should block foreigners from coming into the state because if the foreigners are locked out, the infections would not come into the state.

He said, “Nigerians who travel abroad go out there and bring in the virus, locking residents inside will only increase the suffering in the state.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
