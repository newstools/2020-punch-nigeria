Joseph Olaoluwa A group, the Advocacy for Maritime Development Association of Nigeria, has called on the Federal Government to automate the port system if the dream of making the maritime sector the revenue hub of the country, will be achieved. The Nigerian Shippersâ€™ Council had in November stated that port operations would be automated before the first half of 2021. Segun Alabi, President of the group, told journalists that as the year 2020 winds down, the Federal Government must expedite actions on the move to tap the enormous resources in the sector. Alabi also called for the quick fix of the port access roads which, according to him, was a debacle to free flow of good to and from the port saying it had led to high cost of doing business in the industry. Lauding the recent reopening of some land borders, he said measures should be put in place to significantly reduce the rate of smuggling of banned items into the country. The AMDAN president, who doubles as the Chief Executive Officer of Factotum Nigeria Limited, lamented the rising cost of movement of cargoes in and out of the ports, especially in Lagos. He attributed high cost to extortion of truckers and clearing agents by traffic managers and security agents, adding that the call-up system should address all the anomalies. Copyright PUNCH.
