Dayo Ojerinde The Managing Director of Fidson Healthcare Plc, Fidelis Ayebae, has urged the federal and state governments to create an enabling environment for pharmaceutical companies in the country. He said this on the sidelines of The Great Place to Work awards where the company was certified a great place to work in the gold category. Ayabae said the governments at all levels must patronise the local drug manufacturers. He said, “We need to change how we do business in this country. A private investor will put funds in businesses that will yield good returns and the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector profile does not fit into this definition. “It is, therefore, up to the government to create an enabling environment to boost local pharmaceutical production. It has to be a decisive policy backed up with sound determination to support the manufacturers. The government must patronise the local manufacturers and offer real incentives to pharmaceutical companies.” The Head, Human Resource and Administration of the company, Mrs Adejoke Alli, said the award was a testament to the company’s slogan, ‘… we value life.’ “It was our first time as a company to participate and what an entry we made. For a wholly indigenous pharmaceutical manufacturing company, competing with real juggernauts, we did great. We know there is still room for improvement,” she said. Copyright PUNCH.
