Joseph Olaoluwa The National President of the Nigerian Merchant Navy Officers and Water Transport Senior Staff Association, Bob Yousuo, has assured Nigerian seafarers of better welfare package in 2021. Yousuo said more Nigerian Seafarers would enjoy employment following interventions from the International Transport Workers Federation. He gave this assurance in his Christmas message to members of the association. According to him, a single Collective Bargaining Agreement and joint monitoring team will be put in place for the wellbeing of Nigerian seamen. Similarly, the seafarers’ national leader called on the Federal Government to prepare adequate protection and compensation to seafarers as the second wave of COVID-19 was gradually infiltrating nations of the world. Yousuo urged seafarers employers to take the welfare of their workers very serious by paying them adequately. He said, “We say no to slavery wages. The International Labour Organisation wage scale must be adhered to strictly.” He, however, prayed that the pandemic does not resurge, pointing out that seafarers were indispensable as almost 90 per cent of the global trade was carried out by them.
