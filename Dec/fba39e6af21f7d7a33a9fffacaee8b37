Friday Olokor, Abuja Nigerians should focus their attention more on governance rather than discussing election, power and succession in the 2023 election, Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, advised on Tuesday. He also frowned at the rot besetting the Local Governments in Nigeria, despite huge yearly budgetary allocations. Fayemi, represented by the Chairman, Senate Committee on National Planning and Economic Affairs, Senator Olubunmi Adetunmbi, stated this during the public presentation of a book entitled: ‘Nigeria – Democracy Without Development: How to Fix It’, written by the Special Adviser to Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State (Research and Documentation), Dr. Omano Edigheji. He contended that the states and LGs stood in good stead, to deliver democratic dividends more than the Federal Government. He said, “Nobody is asking questions; everybody is talking about election, power and succession. But the content of government and purpose of power is not in debate. Yes, the National Assembly is responsible for constitutional amendment but the 36 states must concur. “I will worry less about form of governance in Nigeria. But talk about the efficiency of the current system. How can we make the current system work better?”
 
Governor Nasir El’Rufai, represented by Senator Uba Sani, representing Kaduna Central in the National Assembly, attributed the slow pace of development in the country to transparency and accountability deficit. “A large segment of the population have disengaged from the electoral process. The situation is worrisome but it can be fixed,” he said. Edigeji, said that the book was written to correct the decay in the political system in Nigeria.
