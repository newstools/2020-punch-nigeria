Hindi Livinus The Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, on Saturday, signed the 2021 appropriation bill into law. Fintiri expressed appreciation to lawmakers for passing the proposed N140bn ‘budget of stabilisation’ in record time without “padding” it. The governor said the budget would result in value addition to the welfare of citizens, particularly with the allocation of N16bn for “improvement and empowerment” women and youths. He stated that the people would see more infrastructural and human capital development in the budget, which included a recurrent expenditure of N67.2bn, representing 48 per cent of the appropriation, and N72.8bn for capital development projects, representing 52 per cent. Fintiri said, “This budget, christened the budget of stabilisation, which I am signing into law, will see to more infrastructural and human capital development for the good people of the state. Democracy without physical and infrastructural development will lead us to nowhere. “For us, we need to deepen this democracy tirelessly, with the limited resources, particularly after seeing a lot of economic decline because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this budget, we have the largest share of it going to youth and women improvement in 2021. That will mean that we will have a better society, where most of our youths are entrepreneurially developed.” Fintiri had, on November 23, presented a 2021 appropriation bill of N140bn to state lawmakers tagged the ‘budget of stabilisation.’ Copyright PUNCH.
