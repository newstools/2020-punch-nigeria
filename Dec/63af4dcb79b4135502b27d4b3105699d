Former Manchester United and Scotland manager Tommy Docherty has died at the age of 92 following a long illness, his family announced on Thursday. Docherty, who was known as “The Doc”, spent nine years as a player with Preston, and won 25 caps for Scotland. He went on to manage multiple clubs — including Chelsea, Aston Villa and Derby — and had a stint in charge of Scotland. But he was best known for his five-year spell at Old Trafford, overseeing an FA Cup final win over Bob Paisley’s Liverpool in 1977. Docherty died at home in north-west England on Thursday.
