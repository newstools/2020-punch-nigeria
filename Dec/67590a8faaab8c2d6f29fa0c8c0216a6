Tony Okafor, Awka THE Anambra State Coordinator of the National Youth Service Corps, Mr Kehinde Aremu, has said that 95 per cent of the corps members in the state will serve as teachers. Aremu disclosed this during the closing ceremony of the 2020 Batch ‘B’ Stream 1A corps members at the orientation camp in Umuawulu-Mbaukwu in Awka South Local Government Area of the state. He said, “We’ve told them that 95 per cent of them will be in the classrooms. They should see it as an opportunity to impact positively on lives in order to transform the nation,” he said. Congratulating the corps members on a successful completion of the course, Aremu asked them to take advantage of the service year to impact positively on their host communities. He added, “One of the things we’ve always emphasised is that Anambra State is the home of entrepreneurship and resilience. All they need to do is to humble themselves and learn what makes Anambra tick.” Copyright PUNCH.
