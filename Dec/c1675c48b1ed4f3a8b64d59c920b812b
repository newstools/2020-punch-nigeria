Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Police in Rivers State have arrested one Ihuoma Amadi over the alleged murder of her husband who was a former supervisory councillor in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the state. The ex-councillor, Kinikanwo Amadi, 47, was allegedly stabbed to death by Ihuoma over a disagreement at their residence at Nkpolu-Rumuigbo, near Port Harcourt. Spokesman for the police in the state, Nnamdi Omoni, who confirmed the woman’s arrest to our correspondent on Friday, said she was helping the police in investigation. Omoni however said the suspect denied involvement in her husband’s death while giving statement. He said, “She was arrested from the family house amidst confusion and some rowdy situation. The police got there, whisked her away and took her to a police station where she made statements, denying involvement in the dastardly act. We appeal to both families to exercise restraint and allow the law take its full course.” Meanwhile, a younger brother of the late politician, Victor Amadi, said the former councillor was butchered. He added, “All we want is justice because my brother was just murdered in cold blood. He was just 47. Let the police get to the root of the matter.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
