Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, says a former Governor of the state, Adam Oshiomhole, taught him all he knows about politics. Shaibu said this during a thanksgiving service held at Saint Philip Catholic Church in Jettu, Etsako West Local Government Area of the state, on Sunday. The event was part of activities to celebrate his re-election alongside his principal, Governor Godwin Obaseki, under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. He said, “Adams Oshiomhole taught me all I know now politically. He made me stand my ground and help us end godfatherism. I have no quarrel with Adams Oshiomhole. Shuaibu explained that there were a lot of lessons to be learnt from the re-election of Governor Godwin Obaseki. The deputy governor said, “We must come together as a nation in recognising our shared interest in placing boundaries on our competition in order not to divide the nation into hostile and irreconcilable camps. This dangerous impasse is one area where the wisdom of Governor Godwin Obaseki has reigned supreme.” He described Obaseki as a selfless governor whose thoughts are always about the state and the next generation. He appealed to the people of the state to support the administration to deliver on its campaign promises. Earlier in his homily titled, “Rejoice in the Lord”, Bishop Godrick Shabba, admonished believers to be faithful to God. He said that it was a heart of gratitude to God that brought the deputy governor and his family to the house of God. Copyright PUNCH.
