StarTimes GO, an e-shopping channel on pay-TV platform, StarTimes, said it partnered top retail and tech brands on Black Friday sales recently. A statement from the company on Thursday said shoppers would have the opportunity to buy select tech and household products with up to 50 per cent discount. It said the Black Friday would hold on StarTimes GO Channel 002 and Facebook page @StarTimesGO live from 10am. The company said goods on display were directly from manufacturers and StarTimes had partnered them to subsidise the goods, saving shoppers extra money as inflation mounts. According to the company, the goods would be sold at their bottom prices. StarTimes said the products on display included Lontor range of products, TV sets, home theatres and electric shaver, among others. It described StarTimes GO as an integrated e-shopping platform that offered audience access to a massive array of superior quality products, with great designs, at super cheap prices. According to the entertainment firm, foods were directly delivered to the doorsteps of customers. Available on free-to-air on Channel 002, the statement said StarTimes GO Channel had professional hosts and aesthetic scene settings to make shopping entertaining, while the products were displayed by the hosts. “StarTimes GO offers multiple shopping methods including TV shopping, online shopping and phone-call shopping,” the statement said.
