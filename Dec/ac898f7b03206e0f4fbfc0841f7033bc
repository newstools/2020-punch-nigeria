Grace Edema THE Chairman, Human and Environmental Development Agenda Resource Centre, Olanrewaju Suraju, has said that some high profile corruption cases were not reported in the Nigerian media. Speaking on Wednesday at the public presentation and launch of the Fourth Edition of a ‘Compendium of 100 high profile corruption cases in Nigeria,’ Suraju, said the government and public officials always paid their way through an entire administration of criminal justice system. The event which was supported by MacArthur Foundation was organised to mark the World Anti-Corruption Day and it was titled, ‘To recover with integrity’. He said, “The situation has moved from graft to impunity; some even ensure that media houses do not report some of these activities. Court proceedings are not reported. “The government and public officials have gone completely haywire such that they are not so much bothered about putting their hands in public purse.” He also explained that the government was not telling Nigerians how some of the recovered assets were utilised. He said, “But the integrity question is that the government is also not coming forward with sufficient information on the utilisation of some of the recovered assets. We must continuously challenge the system.” Copyright PUNCH.
