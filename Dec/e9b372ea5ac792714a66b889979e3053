Inmates of the correctional facilities in Kirikiri Maximum Prison, Lagos, have received various gift items from the Redeemed Christian Church of God. The church said the gesture was a yearly exercise targeted as an outreach to the inmates and also to mark the Yuletide. The General Overseer of the church, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, emphasised the need for them to rededicate themselves to God and embrace a new life. He said, “In RCCG, such visit is usually part of our Christian social responsibility and it is in line with the instruction Jesus Christ gave to the church on earth which is a continual phenomenon that should never end”. Receiving the items, the Deputy Controller of Corrections, Maximum Security Custodial Centre, Kirikiri, Mike Okorie, thanked the church for its kind gesture and promised to utilise the gifts judiciously for the effective running of the correctional facility. The items included 100 cartons of soap, 50 cartons of toothpaste, 20 dozens of slippers, 50 packs of tissues, cooked food, raw rice, medicine, musical instruments and copies of the Bible.
