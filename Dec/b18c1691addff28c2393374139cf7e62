Maiharaji Altine, Gusau Governor Bello Masari of Katsina State said the students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State,  kidnapped last Friday are in a forest in Zamfara State. Masari, who was answering questions on BBC Hausa Wednesday night, said he got information that the students are in Zamfara. “They are in Zamfara forests, we have gotten the information,” Masari said. He said his government is negotiating with the kidnappers to ensure the release of the abducted students. Masari stated that he had started a dialogue with the abductors, assuring that his administration would secure their release. “We are negotiating with those that have abducted the students and we want to ensure that we secure their release,” he added. He, however, refuted the allegation that the students were kidnapped by Boko Haram.
