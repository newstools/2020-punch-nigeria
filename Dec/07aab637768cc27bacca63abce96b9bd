THE high-powered Committee on Verification and Biometric Data Capture of Local Education Authority Staff in Borno has disclosed that 60 per cent of primary school teachers in the state lacked requisite teaching qualifications. The Chairman of the committee, Dr Shettima Kulima, made this known on Wednesday in Maiduguri while submitting the committee’s report to Governor Babagana Zulum at the Government House. According to Kulima, out of the 26,250 screened, only 10,103 possessed the requisite teaching qualifications. Kulima explained that during the screening, the committee discovered anomalies such as teachers with fake certificates, those due for retirement but had refused to go, questionable appointment letters, underage teachers, and those working in multiple places. “Some are working in two or three places; Biu Local Government Area is leading in the number of such workers. “Maiduguri Metropolitan Council is leading in workers with fake certificates with about 700 of them, followed by Jere Local Government Area with 336. “Konduga Local Government Area has the highest number of those with questionable appointment letters, while Ngala leads with underage employees,” Kulima said. He noted that the committee made 30 recommendations, including staff motivation, in order to sanitise primary education in the state. Kulima said the committee was able to cut the monthly wage bill of primary school teachers after the screening from N693.1m to N427.8m. Receiving the report, the governor lauded the committee for doing a thorough job and assured it of his administration’s commitment to sanitising the system.
