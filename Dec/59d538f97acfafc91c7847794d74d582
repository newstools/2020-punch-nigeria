Temiloluwa O’Peters The Ogun State Commissioner for Industry, Trade and Investment, Kikelomo Longe, has said the government would upgrade its industrial service centre at Onijanganjangan, Abeokuta, in the 2021 fiscal year, to promote the use of indigenous technology and boost the industrialisation of the state. According to a statement on Friday, Longe disclosed this while defending her ministry’s budget proposal of N1.2bn before the State House of Assembly Committee on Finance and Appropriation. She said the centre, which was established during the Olabisi Onabanjo-led administration, required urgent improvement to meet latest industrial technological advancements, which would enable the fabrication of machines and tools needed by various industries in the state. She said, “The upgrade of the industrial service centre is very important to the revolution of our dear state.  The centre, when upgraded, would through its various fabrication help meet increasing demand for indigenous technology. “This upgrade will further create more jobs, boost the naira, as well as aid the country’s fast recovery from the negative effect of the coronavirus pandemic.” The commissioner added that the 2021 proposed budget of N1,215,468,435.23 would enable the ministry, through road haulage collection, registration of business premises and inspection fee, to generate N1,225,000,000. Longe further disclosed that the budget estimate would also enable the ministry to create 18 incubation units and provide laboratory equipment at three technology incubation centres. She added that it would also establish a quality control laboratory to aid its exploration of various geological sites in the state. While presenting for other agencies under the purview of her ministry, the commissioner said the Ogun State Agricultural and Multipurpose Credit Agency, which recently got a board after eight years, would implement a capital expenditure of N631m and a recurrent expenditure of N108m. Longe said, “The Market Development Board also has a capital expenditure of N70,489,262.70, representing 52.70 per cent and N63,265,942.21 representing 47.30 per cent, which would enable the board to improve the conditions of markets within its control. “While the newly created Food Crops Marketing Board has a budget of N250,000,000, out of which N200,000,000 has been earmarked for capital expenditure and N50,000,000 for recurrent expenditure.” Copyright PUNCH.
