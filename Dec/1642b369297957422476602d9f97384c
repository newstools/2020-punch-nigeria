John Alechenu, Abuja A former Governor of Zamfara State, Senator Ahmed Sani Yerima, has declared his intention to vie for Nigeria’s presidency at the end of the tenure of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in 2023. He said this at a media briefing in Abuja, on Wednesday. According to him, he had on three occasions stepped down to enable Buhari to clinch the presidential ticket of the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party as well as the All Progressives Congress. Yerima, as he is fondly called by his supporters, denied claims of the existence of an arrangement to zone the Presidency to the south specifically the South West in 2023.

You can ask Mr. President, he led the group, Asiwaju was there, I was part of it, there was no meeting I didn’t attend or any meeting that I attended that there is such agreement. “(Such an) agreement can’t be verbal; it has to be written. In any case, any agreement that is contrary to the laws of this country is not an agreement. The constitution is very clear, the Constitution of the political parties, the Electoral Act. We are in a democracy and democracy is governed by processes and procedures and by laws.” Yerima further said, “I give you an example of America, George Bush (Snr) was President, George Bush (Jnr) became President. They are from the same family not from the same state, not from the same zone. This is a democracy, if Nigerians decide to vote for Yerima, so be it.” While responding to a question on the way out of the security challenges in the north, he said, “Initially, I was in support of negotiations (with bandits) because I have seen that negotiations had worked in the Niger Delta issue. “We got an amnesty programme and that is why we have peace in the Niger Delta. So, anything that will bring peace and stability, I think should be considered.”
