Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin A former Chief Whip of the Senate, Roland Owie, on Wednesday, appealed to former governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to jettison his 2023 presidential ambition. Owie argued that it would be the turn of the South-East, to produce the next president if the APC zones the position to the South. He said, “Bola Tinubu is my friend, but the truth is that where there is no justice, there will not be peace. Zoning started in 1999 and to God be the glory, it started from the South-West and Obasanjo took it and the PDP won. “But for zoning, Obasanjo would not have been president. He ruled for eight years after which it moved to the north with Yar’adua becoming the president. What he did in about two and a half years, a number of presidents did not do.

His tenure was truncated because when God calls nobody can say no. “President Jonathan finished Yar’adua tenure and then did another four years which means the southern part of Nigeria has done over 14 years. When Buhari finishes his regime by 2023, the north will still have four years. “If Tinubu knows that Nigeria has peace with this zoning, he should not think of the presidency because if we all agree by 2023 that the presidency should come to the south, it is not to South-West, it is not to South-South, it is to South-East.”
