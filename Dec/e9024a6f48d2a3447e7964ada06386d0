Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Over 2,500 artisans and transporters from Osun state have been enumerated by the Bank of Industry for the Federal Government’s business survival fund. According to Dr. Emmanuel Ojoowuro, the focal person for the programme in the state, those already enumerated would soon start receiving money meant to cushion the effect of coronavirus pandemic on Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises through an initiative tagged ‘MSME Survival Fund, Artisan and Transport Support Scheme.’ Speaking at a town hall meeting held with the beneficiaries in Osogbo, Ojoowuro further explained that the 2,500 already enumerated people, constitute the first batch, saying the number might increase when another batch of beneficiaries got verified for payment. He then advised the beneficiaries to ensure they invest the money wisely and in line with the aim of government, adding that the initiative was to save businesses from collapse due to the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. “This is just the first phase, it is an ongoing programme. There will be a second phase. Any moment from now, the 2,500 people should be getting the money because their data is already with the Abuja Office,” he said. Ojoowuro in a statement on Sunday also said the release of the money during the festive season was deliberate since businesses enjoy boom because of the end of the year sales. He advised the beneficiaries to use the fund to grow their businesses.
