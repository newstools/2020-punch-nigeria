Chima Azubuike, Gombe A resident of Gombe State, Abubakar Muhammad, has narrated the ordeal of his late brother, Aliyu Muhammad, at the Kumo Divisional Police Station, Gombe, which resulted in his death. Muhammad disclosed this at the State High Court, venue of the Gombe State Commission of Inquiry into human rights violations by the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad and other police units and security agencies in the state. He explained how he resisted every attempt made by the police to ensure that he signed an undertaking before his brother could access healthcare. Muhammad stated, “My brother was arrested on the 24th of June 2019, over a case of rape, but I could not go because I was invigilating an exam in school. But I called my other brother Umaru, who was a former constabulary. “When I visited the station on the 25th of June, two policemen met me at the gate of the Kumo Divisional Police Station and took me to the court in Kumo. They asked me to sign that my brother would be returned back to the station. When I refused to sign, they led me to him after much resistance.

The police abandoned us with the responsibility of paying for his treatment.
