He said, “The recent Kankara incident was unfortunate. I am in Katsina to ensure that such an incident will and shall never happen again. “We are in Katsina today to ensure that the state is crime-free. “Internal security is the job of the police. We should never give an opportunity to criminals to operate and we have resolved not to allow either bandits or any other criminals anytime to operate either in the morning, afternoon, or at night. “That is why we are liaising with our partners including security agencies and other stakeholders like the Miyyetti Allah, not to allow bandits and other criminals to operate.” The meeting was still in session by the time of filing this report.
