Nike Popoola Mutual Benefits Assurance Plc has secured the approval of its shareholders to raise N4.8bn through the sale of 8,888,888,889 ordinary shares of 50 kobo each at 54 kobo per share, subject to regulatory approvals. The company received the approval during its extraordinary general meeting in Lagos. It said it was embarking on a private placement to raise additional N4.8bn from its existing investors who had shown interest to increase their stake. Among the shareholders that indicated interest to take up the private placements included Charles Enterprises and Arubiewe Farms Limited. The Chairman, Mutual Benefits Assurance, Dr Akin Ogunbiyi, said given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world economies and the negative investorsâ€™ sentiments in the stock market, the company decided to raise the additional capital required. He said this was by way of private placement of its shares to some existing substantial investors who had indicated their readiness to commit further investment into the company to meet the new minimum regulatory capital. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mutual Benefits Assurance, Femi Asenuga, said there were plans to focus on the business and increase shareholder value with payment of dividends in 2021. He assured shareholders that the company was doing everything possible to reward shareholders for their support and patronage in 2021. The company said it would help it to advanced its recapitalisation efforts in compliance with the regulatory requirement set for underwriting companies in the industry by the National Insurance Commission.
