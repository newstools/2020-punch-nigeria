She said, “Our nurses also got infected at the University College Hospital at the peak of the pandemic in Nigeria. We have it on record. “At least, 36 of us were infected at UCH. Some (infections) were severe, some mild, some moderate. But, to the glory of God, we all came out of it. “We did not record any death or loss to the effect of COVID-19 despite our level of exposure to the infection.
