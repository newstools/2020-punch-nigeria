Ife Ogunfuwa Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, on Thursday, says the 14.7km Ijebu-Ode-Epe Expressway will be completed by May 2021. The governor made this known at the official unveiling of the new ultra-modern automated PET line of the Nigerian Breweries Plc in Ijebu Ode. He said the project had been delayed by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating a shift in completion date from February to May next year. The governor said, “Ogun State shares border with other states in the region, except Ekiti State. This has conferred on us the role of a gateway to other parts of the country. This informed our decision to construct the Ijebu-Ode-Epe Expressway. “This was flagged off this year and was planned to be completed by February but for COVID-19. By the grace of God, it will be completed by May 2021.” During an assessment tour of the road earlier in November, Abiodun had said the opening of the road would provide more opportunities for commercial activities to thrive.

He also said the road will help to reduce the burden of traffic on the busy Lagos-lbadan Expressway. The governor added that the expressway will open the surrounding communities to more industrial activity as Lagos was already expanding along the Lekki corridor.
