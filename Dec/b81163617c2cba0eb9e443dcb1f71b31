Samson Folarin The Lagos State Government has commended farmers for ensuring that the food supply chain in the state was not broken during the COVID-19 lockdown. The state Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms. Abisola Olusanya, who spoke on Sunday at the December edition of the Eko City Farmers’ Fair and Farmers’ Appreciation Day at Ikeja, noted that the government recognised and appreciated the contribution of farmers to food security in the state. According to her, 2020 has been a special year with the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the world. She said agriculture was the second most impacted sector after health by the pandemic. “We need to understand the importance of our farmers in the scheme of things; without farmers, the Nigeria of today cannot survive. “We know what happened during the lockdown when people thought they were not going to get access to food, but our farmers came through for us. “Many thanks to our dear farmers; you stood by us by ensuring that the food supply chain was not broken at any time. It was stretched yes, but with your efforts and God’s grace it was not broken,” she said. The commissioner said the fair was intended to be a melting point for farmers to sell directly to consumers and for Lagosians to buy farm fresh products at farm gate prices. Copyright PUNCH.
