Olaide Oyelude, Katsina Gunmen suspected to be bandits on Friday night invaded Government Science Secondary School Kankara in Katsina State and abducted unknown number of students. This happened barely a few hours after the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), arrived in his home state of Katsina for a week-long private visit. Residents told The PUNCH that the gunmen invaded the school about 10.15 p.m and shot at one of the policemen manning the main gate of the school. One of the policemen, who was said to have been wounded on the leg, is currently receiving treatment in a hospital in the Kankara town. It was learnt that the bandits then proceeded to the staff quarters where they abducted the wife of an employee in the school before they stormed the students’ hostel and abducted unspecified number of students. Military sources disclosed that troops of the Nigerian Army later arrived at the school to confront the bandits and the bandits absconded with some of the students in the process.

The Spokesman for the Katsina Police Command, SP Gambo Isah, confirmed the incident but could not disclose the exact number of students abducted. Speaking with The PUNCH on Saturday morning, Isah said, “We are still taking the headcount of the students. Maybe no student was even abducted as some of the students had to escape from the school during the gun duel. So, I cannot give you the exact number of students actually abducted for now.” A senior staff at the school equally said the headcount of the students were being taken as of the time of filing this report. The staff, who pleaded for anonymity, added that parents of wards have rushed to the school to know the fate of their children.
