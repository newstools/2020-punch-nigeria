Peter Dada, Akure The youth of two communities of Ude and Isinigbo in the Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State engaged one another in a communal clash that resulted in the destruction of property worth millions of naira. PUNCH Metro gathered that two people were feared killed in the clash, while the palace of the traditional ruler of Ude town, Chief Sunday Boboye, was set ablaze as Boboye fled. According to a source, the fight was not unconnected with land disputes between the two communities, as the Ude traditional ruler allegedly claimed to own part of Isinigbo community. The Oluomo of Isinigbo, Chief Oluwole Kareem, said his community protested to stop the continued demolition of houses by the Ajagun of Ude (Boboye). He said, “Boboye came to us that we were occupying the land illegally. He said he had won the case. He first came and demolished over 50 houses. We protested, but the government did not do anything. His lawyer said he was not aware of the demolition. If he had won the case, he was supposed to give us time for dialogue. He did not give us that chance. “Some people bought land here 15 years ago. He placed a sign board and renamed our community New Ude Estate. Isinigbo has been in existence for more than 800 years. He wants to make our place an extension of Ude.” The Ondo State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, confirmed the incident, but said nobody was killed. He said normalcy had been restored in the communities, while investigation had commenced into the incident. Efforts to reach Boboye were unsuccessful, as his telephone line was not reachable as of the time of filing this report. Copyright PUNCH.
