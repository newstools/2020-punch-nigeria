Gibson Achonu, Owerri The Coalition of Okigwe youths, a political pressure group, has protested the outcome of the December 5, 2020 Imo North senatorial by-election. Members of the group who held a peaceful protest in front of the Independent National Electoral Commission, in Owerri, on Tuesday, carried placards with different inscriptions to register their displeasure. Some of the placards read: “Do not create a bad precedent”, “Who was the candidate of the APC?”, and “Obey the Rule of Law” among others. The Coordinator of the group, Mr. Chiedozie Ibekwe who addressed newsmen shortly afterwards, said, youths of Imo North would not allow their senatorial district to be used for what he described as “political experiments with dangerous undertones.” He said, “Our position hinges on the fact that INEC declared a political party as winner of the election without announcing the candidate of that party. “On December 4,2020 a Court of Appeal disqualified Senator Ifeanyi Araraume on the grounds that he did not win APC’s primary election and on the same day, a Federal High Court disqualified Mr. Ifeanyi Ibezim, on the grounds of certificate forgery.” “It is an aberration to the rule of law that a party that went into the election without a bona-fide candidate was declared winner of that election.” “We therefore use this peaceful protest to call on INEC to comply with the Court orders that technically disqualify the APC from the contest and declare the PDP and its candidate, Emmanuel Okewulonu as winner.” Responding, Imo INEC Public Relations Officer, Mrs. Emmanuella Ben-Opara assured the protesters that their concerns will be forwarded to the appropriate quarters.
