Chima Azubuike, Gombe The Gombe State, Commissioner for Finance, Muhammad Magaji, has explained that the N682.6m increase in the state 2021 budget was due to the need to improve the living condition of citizens and residents of the state. Magaji offered this explanation at a news briefing, in Gombe, on Thursday. He said, “The state Assembly looked at areas they thought we underfunded so they made the adjustment to ensure the social sector is properly funded. Of course, it is in the interest of the state and the adjustment has been accepted. Implementation starts on the 1st of January, 2021. “The focus of the budget has not changed; the house only went through the nitty gritty of the budget to ensure it goes through normal scrutiny. “It is targeted at ensuring the economy of Gombe state is rebuilt after the 2020 pandemic which has ravaged not just our economy but economies of the world. What we are interested in doing is to ensure human capital development is put on the front burner.” Also speaking, the Speaker, Abubakar Luggerewo noted that 2021 budget was the first time that less attention was given to governance above capital projects.
