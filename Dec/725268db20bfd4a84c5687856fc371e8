Peter Dada,  Akure THE Ondo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party on Tuesday suspended five members of the party over alleged gross misconduct and anti-party activities. It was gathered that the action of the party against the axed members was not unconnected with the lingering leadership crisis rocking the party in the South-West between the Governor Seyi Makinde and the former Governor Ayo Fayose factions. The suspension of members was contained in a statement issued by the state Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr Kennedi Peretei, on Tuesday. The statement was titled ‘Ondo PDP suspends members, dissolves state elders’ committee.’ According to the statement, the affected members are Chief Oyedele Ibini, Lad Ojomo, Mr.Ayo Fadaka, Mr Rasheed Elegbeleye and Mr Ebenezer Alabi. It read in part, “Pursuant to Section 58(1) (a) (b) (f) and (h) of the Peoples Democratic Party Constitution (2017 as amended), the underlisted persons are hereby suspended indefinitely from the party for anti-party activities and gross misconduct. “By this decision, they are expected to stop parading themselves as members of the party. All organs of the party are to take note in this regard. They stand suspended until the outcome of the report of the State Disciplinary Committee. “We also want to put it on record that, the State Executive Committee of the PDP in Ondo State did not send any delegation to anywhere to represent the party. Whoever lays claim to such is an impostor and does not represent the opinions of our teaming supporters in the state.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
