Joseph Olaoluwa The Lagos Computerised Vehicle Inspection Service has observed a reduction in the inspection of vehicles. Media Relations Manager of LACVIS, Abike Awojobi, in an interview with our correspondent explained that the mindset of not inspecting vehicles was abnormal. She said, “We are dealing with a mindset that is conditioned to accept the abnormal as the normal. It is abnormal to take your vehicle on the road without knowing its status, just believing that it has a good exterior. “That is a fallacy that most people carry around. Some people trust mechanics but what if you are using a mechanic that is not in tune with global best practices?” She urged motorists who are not in the habit of constantly checking their vehicles to do so, as they had already paid for it in a bid to secure their roadworthiness certificate. She said, “Some people believe that their vehicle is in good condition or that inspection is totally unnecessary. Before now, our fathers used to inspect their vehicles, but 50, 60 years cascading down, the whole thing went south. “Your generation and my generation do not know anything about vehicle inspection and form the bulk of motorists on the road now.” She added, “The effort we are putting in this advocacy is to reduce the carnage on our roads. You come or do not come, it has already been paid for. We do not need to wield the big stick before people adhere to safety. There is a mindset deficit amongst many road users.” Awojobi explained that people usually complain that their mechanics are ripping them off. However, she noted that inspection would tell what was wrong with the vehicle with proper diagnosis. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
