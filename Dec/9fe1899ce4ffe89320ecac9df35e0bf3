Joseph Olaoluwa The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority has issued an advisory circular to pilots and airline operators, regarding the severe dust haze and fog phenomenon prevalent in Nigerian airports. The statement signed by the Director-General, NCAA, Capt. Musa Nuhu, on Tuesday, explained that an adverse weather condition was expected to subsist from October in the far North; November over the North Central; and December over the Southern part of the country.

The statement tasked pilots, operators and air traffic controllers to comply with the advisory, granting traffic controllers the right to close the airspace especially when heavy fog or severe dust haze was observed. Part of the statement read, “Air traffic controllers may temporarily close airspace when hazardous weather conditions such as heavy fog or severe dust haze reducing the visibility to below airport operating minimal are observed or forecasted by Nimet. “Pilots/flight crew members shall obtain adequate departure, en-route and destination weather information and briefing from Nimet Aerodrome offices prior to flight operations. “Pilots shall exercise maximum restraint whenever adverse weather is observed or forecast by NIMET and brief passengers accordingly.” It also urged the travelling public to be patient and understanding in the yuletide month as flights may be delayed or cancelled on account of weather situations.
