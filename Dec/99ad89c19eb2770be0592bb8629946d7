Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has failed to tender the presidential approval on the creation of the new five zonal commands and departments as directed by the Police Service Commission. This has stalled the promotion of 112 senior officers, which was stood down by the commission in October. The PSC, at its plenary meeting in Abuja on October 2, made the presidential authorisation a condition for the promotion of the 112 officers recommended for elevation by the IG. Adamu had in May announced the establishment of five zonal commands, including Ondo/Ekiti with headquarters in Akure, Ondo State; Enugu/Anambra/Ebonyi Command with headquarters at Ukpo-Dunukofia in Anambra State. Others are Bayelsa/Rivers Command with headquarters in Yenogoa, Bayelsa State; Katsina/Kaduna Command with headquarters in Katsina; and Yobe/Borno Command with headquarters in Maiduguri, Borno State. The Force Intelligence Bureau was also excised from the FCID to become a full-fledged department to be headed by a Deputy Inspector-General of Police. Copyright PUNCH.
