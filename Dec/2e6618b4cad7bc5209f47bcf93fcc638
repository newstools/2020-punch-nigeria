James Abraham, Jos THE remains of a former Minister of Defence, General Domkat Bali, were on Monday laid to rest in his Langtang North country home of Plateau State amidst tears and tributes A funeral service was held in his honour at the Jos headquarters of the Church of Christ in Nations before his remains were moved to Langtang North for internment. The event attracted a lot of dignitaries from far and wide, including the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Gabriel Olonisakin, and the State Governor, Simon Lalong, who poured encomiums on the late army officer who died on December 4, 2020. Lalong described the late Minister as an epitome of humility, courage and integrity, pointing out that throughout his lifetime, Gen. Bali demonstrated discipline, commitment, diligence and valour in his duties where he rose to the peak of his career, retiring as a four-star General. He said, “He was a man who had a lot of opportunities in life but was never arrogant or haughty. He remained principled, steadfast and truthful in his dealings.” In his remarks, Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Gabriel Olonisakin, said the nation and its Armed Forces were grateful for the service of Gen. Bali, who gave his best to protecting the territorial integrity of Nigeria. Bali’s widow, Esther, and her children, paid tribute to the late General whom they described as a friend, mentor, father and husband who sacrificed so much for the family and the nation as a whole. In a sermon, COCIN Vice President, Rev. Dr. Obed Dashan, said the life of the late General should motivate those still living to submit their lives to Jesus Christ in order to gain eternity just as late Bali did when he accepted salvation.
