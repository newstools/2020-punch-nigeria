Peter Dada, Akure A member of the Ondo State Assembly, Mr. Success Torhukerhijo, on Thursday rejected the proposed N159.796bn 2021 budget currently before the House on the grounds that it failed to make provisions for the Ijaw ethnic group. The state Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, had a few weeks ago, presented the budget to the Assembly for approval. However, the aggrieved lawmaker who represents Ese Odo Constituency in the Assembly,  said, “It is unfortunate and heartbreaking that the present administration since inception in past four years, has spent close to N900 billion naira and Ese-Odo Local Government, which is one of the two local governments that qualified Ondo state to earn its oil producing status, cannot boast of any meaningful development. “In the present scenario, with an estimated N56.774 billion plus, it is highly incredulous that the oil producing Ese-Odo Local Government has absolutely nothing appropriated for its people and development.” When contacted, the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation,  Mr. Donald Ojogo, who also hails from the lawmaker’s constituency said, “He is representing a people, a constituency,  the onus now lies on him to do the needful on the floor of the Parliament. That is one of their primary responsibilities. I, as a member of the executive does not have the competence to disclose details of a budget that has not been passed by the legislature.” Copyright PUNCH.
