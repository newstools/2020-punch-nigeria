Olaide Oyelude, Katsina All schools in Katsina State have been directed to end their third term for the 2019/2020 academic session. The schools, which were supposed to end the session next week, have been directed to remain closed until further notice. Although no reason was given for the decision, the development is being linked to the Friday night bandits’ abduction of unknown numbers of students from Government Science Secondary School, Kankara. A statement by the Public Relations Officer, Ministry of education, Sani Suleiman, read, “This is to inform the general public especially principals, parents/guardians, proprietors of community and private schools that the third term for 2019/2020 academic session has come to an end today, Saturday 12th December, 2020. “Therefore, all public, community, and private schools are to remain closed till further notice.” Governor Aminu Masari had also on Saturday ordered the immediate closure of all boarding secondary schools in the state. The directive was consequent upon the abduction of an unspecified number of students of the Government Science Secondary School Kankara by bandits on Friday night. The governor gave the directive during his visit to the school on Saturday for an on-the-spot assessment of the situation. He was accompanied by his Deputy, Alhaji Mannir Yakubu, and other top government officials. The Governor, during the visit, also met with the school officials, some parents, traditional and religious leaders as well as security officials. He said security officials comprising the military, the police, and the Department of State Security had swung into action and were on the trail of the abductors.
