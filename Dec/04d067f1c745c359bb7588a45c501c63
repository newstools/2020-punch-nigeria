True luxury can’t be owned by all. So, when we say we go harder to curate luxury items just for you, it’s nothing but the hard truth. We want you to be able to create a space where the dazzling lights are a first runner up to that of nature, where your bathroom fittings speak opulence, your kitchen fittings exude elegance, the type that would leave the best of chefs enchanted, and where your walls welcome you at first glance and your style is never compromised. At the Class Room, we understand that the tiniest fittings and details matter in creating the kind of class you want.  This is why we’ve created a room full of class and luxury for you with our range of luxury products such as light fittings by Glint, elegant bathroom trappings by Ducet, kitchen fittings by Kale, and attractive wall decorative paints by Dr. Smart. Come experience Style, Luxury and more at The Class Room. We would be opening our doors and delighted to host you at our showroom from the 8th of December.
