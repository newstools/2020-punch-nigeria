Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The crisis rocking the Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has worsened. Two factions of the party are at loggerheads over which one was the recognised caretaker committee. Recalled that the APC National Executive Committee on Tuesday dissolved the executive committees of all its organs at the zonal, state, local government and ward levels while asking some to evolve into caretaker committees. A faction of the party led by Anselm Ojezua, on Thursday said, “We have given instructions to our counterparts at the lower levels of the party to make consultations. “We are more interested in knowing the future of our party because you know this was the party to beat in Edo state in the past 12 years until Oshiomhole came and messed things up here. “So, it is not just enough to treat us the way they treated other states. This state needs proper attention; to a certain point it is in assessing the desires and wishes of the membership in Edo State and if they don’t do that, then we will now be wondering whether we are in the right association.” Copyright PUNCH.
