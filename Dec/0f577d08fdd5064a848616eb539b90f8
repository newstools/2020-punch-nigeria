Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday described his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron as “trouble” and said he hoped France would “get rid of him” as soon as possible, in the latest salvo in an escalating war of words between the two leaders. “Macron is a trouble for France. With Macron, France is passing through a very, very dangerous period. I hope that France will get rid of Macron trouble as soon as possible,” Erdogan told reporters after Friday prayers in Istanbul. Turkey and France are embroiled in a series of disputes from tensions in the eastern Mediterranean to the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. (AFP)
