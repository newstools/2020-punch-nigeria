Kidnappers also abducted a man at the ever-busy Wetheral Road in Owerri on Tuesday afternoon and zoomed off with him to Aba Road, shooting sporadically in the air. Despite these incidents and many more, the state police command said the police in the state had not been overwhelmed by criminals. The spokesperson for the police in the state, Orlando Ikeokwu, in a telephone conversation with The PUNCH in Owerri on Thursday, assured that the command was closing in on the criminals. He disclosed that the state Commissioner of Police, Issac Akinmoyede, had activated the tactical units of the command and they were working effortlessly to free the victims and arrest the gunmen. Ikeokwu said, “That the state recorded a few incidents of kidnapings and killings do not mean that the hoodlums are having the upper hand. It does not in any way mean that they have overwhelmed us.
