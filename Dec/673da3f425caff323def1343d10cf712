Dayo Ojerinde A non-profit organisation, Beyond The Classroom Foundation, has partnered MasterCard Foundation to distribute free COVID-19 safety packs to 3,000 children through the COVID-19 community champions volunteer programme. According to a statement on Tuesday, the programme would see the volunteers visit communities in Lagos and Abuja to educate and distribute free COVID-19 children safety pack to 3,000 children. The founder of the non-profit organisation, Raquel Daniel, said, “Children across the world are adapting to the evolving changes in daily life caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of their favorite places of public gathering are still closed and they are still trying to adjust to the new normal. For those in hard to reach communities with little or no access to mobile phones, it is not easy to keep them away from playing and touching their faces when they have little or no information about the coronavirus.” The Country Lead, Programme Communications, Mastercard Nigeria, Nonye Omotola, noted that the partnership was part of Mastercard Foundation’s COVID-19 Recovery and Resilience Programme and a tremendous opportunity for adults to educate the children about the virus and simple ways they can keep themselves, their family and friends safe. She said, “Any young person above the age of 18 can be a COVID-19 Community Champion. Selected Champions will be equipped with the information needed to raise the awareness and help children stay safe during the Christmas holiday and as schools resume next year.” Daniel added that the programme was a great way for young people to volunteer their time and make a positive impact in their communities.
