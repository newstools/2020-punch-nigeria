Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Task Force on the Environment and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit has impounded 130 motorcycles for plying restricted routes. It was gathered that the motorcycles, whose riders plied the Iyana-Ipaja, Abule-Egba, Fagba and Ogba areas of the state, were impounded after several warnings issued to the riders to desist from operating on restricted routes. The new Chairman of the agency, Shola Jejeloye, who led the enforcement team, stated that enforcement followed a series of complaints received from the public on illegal and criminal activities perpetrated by motorcyclists. He said, “While some of them harass innocent members of the public at various bus stops, others engage in all sorts of criminal acts by dispossessing their passengers of valuables such as phones, jewellery and bags. Also, motorists held in traffic both morning and night around these areas were not spared. “A total clampdown on illegal activities of these motorcycle operators on restricted routes will now be vigorously sustained on a daily basis throughout this Yuletide season to check criminal activities perpetrated by these notorious motorcyclists.” The chairman, who urged the various motorcyclist associations to educate their members on the need to desist from plying restricted routes in the state, warned all dispatched riders to also desist from engaging in illegal activities. Jejeloye added that anyone caught violating the state traffic laws would be prosecuted. Copyright PUNCH.
