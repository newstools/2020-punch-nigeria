Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party on Monday said the Action Alliance, a petitioner in the Edo State governorship election petition tribunal, had no petition before the court because it failed to file an application for pre-hearing notice. Recall that AA and four other political parties are challenging the outcome of the Edo State governorship election which brought in governor Godwin Obaseki for a second term. At pre-hearing on Monday, counsel for the PDP, Onyechi Ikpeazu, said the petitioner had forfeited its petition for failing to file pre-hearing notice which he said is in line with the Electoral Act 2010 as amended He said, “The tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition and we urge the tribunal to dismiss the application. We didn’t receive the petitioner’s reply to activate the pre-hearing by applying for the issuance of the pre-hearing forms.” But counsel to AA, Stephen Osaigbovo, who objected to the position of PDP, said the petitioner has not forfeited its petition. Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Abdulrazaq Abdulkareem, adjourned till Friday, December 11, for the ruling.
