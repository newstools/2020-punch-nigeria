Raphael Ede, Enugu A political pressure group, the Zikist-Buharist Movement, on Sunday rebuked the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, for asking the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to resign over rising cases of insecurity in the country. In a statement titled, ‘Their Efforts Not Good Enough, PMB’s frankness commendable,’ signed by the group’s Chairman and Secretary, Stanley Ohajuruka and Godwin Onwusi, respectively, they said, President Buhari was concerned and was taking steps to address the nation’s security situation. The statement read in part, “ZBM shares the agony of Nigerians over the compounded security challenges and the trust deficit arising therefrom. “However, Mr. President’s statement to us recognized the import of his mandate and the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) to secure our dear country from unprecedented insurgency, unbridled armed robbery, untoward kidnapping and crass banditry. “For those who call for Mr. President’s resignation and impeachment, especially the Peoples Democratic Party, ZBM appreciates their frustration, worries and genuine concern over unbridled insecurity in the land.
