Nike PopoolaSkipAds by Jaiz Bank Plc has launched a hajj savings scheme. The bank disclosed this in a statement on Sunday titled ‘Savings for hajj is like commencing the journey – Jaiz MD’. The Managing Director, Jaiz Bank, Hassan Usman, while speaking on Saturday at the launch of the scheme in Lagos, said the savings scheme was a significant milestone for all stakeholders in the hajj ecosystem in Nigeria. He said from planning, funding to actual operations, the scheme had the potential to positively affect every act and actor in the process. He said, “With such a scheme in place, intending pilgrims that do not have the wherewithal can gradually plan and actualise their dreams without stress by saving gradually. “Even those who may not live to witness the completion of their savings may, by Allah’s infinite mercy, receive the reward for hajj because they are pilgrims by intention (niyyat) and action (amal) together. “As this scheme grows over time, NAHCON and the various State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Boards can have the liquid funds required to effectively plan hajj operations early, thereby securing better bargain for accommodation and other services for their pilgrims. “The scheme can also be the key to making them highly self-sustaining in the long run.” He added that, “On our part as a bank, we are committed to this journey and we are ready to support it with best-in-class technology infrastructure as well as safe investment management practice.” Copyright PUNCH.
