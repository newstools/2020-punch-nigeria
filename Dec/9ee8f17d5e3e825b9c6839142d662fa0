Tukur Muntari, Kano The All progressive Congress in Kano state is set to commence aggressive new membership registrations which would also eventually give way for the election of new executive members of the party. Kano APC chairman, Abdullahi Abbas, who disclosed this on Sunday, said the membership registration would accommodate millions of new defectors. He noted that the new registration exercise would enable the party to ascertain its popularity vis-a-vis its participation in the 2023 general elections. He said, “There is the need for our party, although a ruling party, to renew registration of its members so that we will know our strengths and weaknesses and what we should do to make things better before the 2023 general elections.” “Anybody who is interested in contesting for any office of the party should prepare to do so, but that should be after the registration of the membership of our great party, this is because you cannot contest an office except you are a true card-carrying member of APC,” he added.
