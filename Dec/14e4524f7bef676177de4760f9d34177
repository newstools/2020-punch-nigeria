Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The President of the Nigeria Union of Pensioners, Dr Abel Afolayan, has protested the proposed removal of NUP members from the Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate payroll. Afolayan in his address at the 19th Edition of Pensioners Day Celebration in Abuja on Friday said the union was in receipt of a letter from PTAD that a large number of pensioners would be deleted from its payroll. The union also kicked against the plan by state governors to borrow N17tn from the pension funds, saying that ‘they cannot reap where they did not sow’. Copyright PUNCH.
