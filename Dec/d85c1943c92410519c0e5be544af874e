The Managing Director, May & Baker Nigeria Plc, Mr Nnamdi Okafor, is set to retire by the end of 2020 financial year, after almost a decade-long tenure. This was disclosed during a press briefing by the company in Lagos on Friday. The company said Okafor, who was appointed in February 2011, recorded several milestones and did further consolidation of the pharmaceutical company into one of Africa’s globally certified centres of excellence in pharmaceutical manufacturing. It said the board of directors of the company had notified the Nigerian Stock Exchange and the Securities Exchange Commission of the impending retirement of Okafor and the commencement of a succession process by Mr Patrick Ajah, a vastly experienced pharmacist and business manager of nearly three-decade experience. The company said, “Ajah, who resumed on December 1, 2020 as an executive director, would work with Okafor for a one-month transition period and assume the leadership as managing director with effect from January 1, 2021. “For nearly a decade, Okafor has come to be regarded as one of the most impactful leaders in the nearly eight decades of May & Baker Nigeria. “Taking over from when PBT was barely a third of a billion naira, Okafor has tripled this having led May & Baker Nigeria to becoming a billion-naira-profit company.” Copyright PUNCH.
