The injured persons, who came to the LCA in a white bus, claimed they were victims of the alleged tollgate shootings soldiers. They were accompanied by a banner-carrying group, New Nigeria Network. The spokesperson for the group, a lady, said, “We have people with amputated legs; we have people with brain surgery in this van; we have dozens of them that are yet to be discharged. This is from Lekki tollgate massacre 2020. We want justice. We don’t want to be silenced; we don’t want to be marginalised even in our own country.” But the Nigerian Army has consistently denied shooting at or killing protesters at the tollgate.
