John Alechenu, Abuja The Progressives Governors Forum has appealed to Nigerians to set aside their ethno-religious and political differences and unite in order to resolve the nation’s security challenges. The PGF is the umbrella body of governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress. This was contained in a statement titled, “Merry Christmas and 59 Happy Cheers to PGF Chairman, HE Abubakar Atiku Bagudu,” signed by the forum’s Treasurer who is also the Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, in Abuja, on Friday. While wishing all Nigerians a Merry Christmas, a peaceful celebration and blessings of the season, the forum also wished its chairman, the Kebbi State Governor, Abubakar Badudu, a happy 59th birthday celebration. The statement read in part, “The PGF enjoins all Nigerians to unite and work together irrespective of our differences to resolve all our security challenges. “Under the leadership of His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Forum members are confident that the nation will overcome all security challenges.
