Kayode Oyero Osun State Government has rescinded its earlier decision banning churches from holding cross-over services. This was contained in a statement on Tuesday signed by the Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs Funke Egbemode. In the statement titled, ‘Covid-19: Osun gives fresh directives on Crossover Service’, the commissioner said the government’s sensitivity to the mood of the season has necessitated a review of its earlier position. Egbemode said, “The Government of the State of Osun has decided to allow cross over religious gatherings, But any organisation holding cross over service must note that they are expected to close the service early and everyone must be off the streets by 1:00am. “Security operatives have been given the directive to enforce this guideline. Religious bodies and citizens are therefore advised to comply because we do not want anyone to spend the first day of the year in police custody.
