Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Defence Headquarters has claimed that troops rescued the over 300 students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina, abducted by bandits on December 11. The DHQ spokesman, Maj. Gen. John Enenche, in a statement on Friday, said the military has kept its promises of ensuring the rescue of the hostages. Enenche’s claims, however, contradicted the statement by Katsina State Governor Aminu Masari that the students were released sequel to the negotiations with the bandits by the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria leadership. The governor also claimed that no ransom was paid, noting that the hostages were voluntarily released by the bandits. But the DHQ in its statement on Friday, titled, ‘Troops of Operation Hadarin Daji rescue abducted students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina,’ said, “Keeping to its promise to ensure the safe return of all abducted students of Government Science Secondary School Kankara, Katsina State, troops of Operation Hadarin Daji rescued all 344 abducted students on Thursday 17 December 2020.
