Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin A faction of All Progressive Congress led by Anslem Ojezua has exited the party, citing loss of confidence in the national leadership of the party and alleged disobedience to the party constitution. Ojezua on Wednesday announced their intention to join the ruling Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State as part of resolution reached at an enlarged meeting of the State Executive Council of APC Committee members and the chairmen of all the local government area chapters of the party and the state leaders of the party in Benin. The resolution, which was signed by 22 members of the executives of the party led by Ojezua and chairmen of the party across the 18 local government areas of the state, indicated that over 150,000 of their supporters had concluded plans to defect with them. Part of the resolution reads, “Having reviewed the romance between the National Caretaker Committee and leaders of a parallel group called the Edo Peoples Movement, who have been parading themselves as members of the APC in the state in spite of their suspension from the party, it is hereby resolved that our members should join our leaders and members, who have earlier relocated to the PDP with His Exceuency, Mr. Nogheghase Obaseki and his Deputy, Rt. Hon. Philip Shaibu.” Copyright PUNCH.
