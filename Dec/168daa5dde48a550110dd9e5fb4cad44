Tony Okafor, Awka Group Captain Nnamdi Nnoruka (retd.), has said the 2021 Anambra State governorship election will be the last time he would be seeking to govern the state. Nnoruka who indicated interest in being the standard bearer of the Labour Party, said this during the inauguration of the LP State Secretariat in Amawbia, Anambra State. Nnoruka said, “We are going to tear our shirts in this fight. It’s my last fight and I’m going to fight it with all the energy and strength in me.” The retired air force officer said if elected, he would bring his years of military experience to bear in tackling the security challenges in the state, adding that none of the aspirants eyeing the seat could match him on issues of security. Also speaking, Gen. Arinze Ebenebe (retd) said, “You should know that the military is an extension of politics, even though we’re not politicians. Our support will boost his ego because we’re going to ensure the right things are done.” Copyright PUNCH.
