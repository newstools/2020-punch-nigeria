Tukur Muntari, Kano The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, Kano State branch has directed its members under the Kano zone to sell fuel at N162.44k per litre from Monday. The Federal Government had reduced the price of the commodity from N168 per litre to N162.44 per litre following the public outcry. The IPMAN chairman in Kano, Alhaji Bashir Dan-Malam gave the directive while briefing newsmen in Kano on Monday. He said the directive followed the reduction of the price of the commodity to marketers by the NNPC from N153.17 to N148.17 per litre with effect from Monday, December 14, 2020. He said since the Federal Government had reduced N5, the marketers have no option than to also reduce the price of the commodity at their filling stations to members of the public. “I am therefore directing our members in Kano zone to commence the sell of the commodity at N162.44 per litre from today in compliance with the government’s directive,” he said. “I want to also assure the public that we are committed to transporting the product to all states under Kano including Katsina, Bauchi, Yobe and Jigawa especially during the yuletide period to prevent scarcity. He, however, commended the Federal Government for listening to the public complaint and outcry over the recent increase in the price of the product. According to him, IPMAN will continue to support the Federal Government to ensure uninterrupted fuel supply across the nooks and crannies of the country. The IPMAN chairman commended the management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation for ensuring accountability and transparency in the oil and gas sector.
