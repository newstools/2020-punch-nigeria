Dayo Ojerinde The Lagos State Government on Wednesday reminded residents to be conscious and take charge of their environment during the Christmas and New Year celebrations. The Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, said this in a statement on Wednesday. He urged residents to adopt cleanliness in all forms and obey the COVID-19 protocols. He noted that it was necessary for Lagosians to show utmost love to the environment as they celebrate with moderation. “A lot of waste would be generated during the Christmas and New Year celebrations; there is, therefore, the need for proper disposal of animal waste as well as proper sorting and bagging of such refuse and placing them at designated points.” The Commissioner assured Lagosians that the Lagos State Waste Management Authority was positioned to respond adequately to clear all the wastes that may be generated during the Yuletide period. Bello urged residents of the state to be mindful of their activities while they celebrate and also avoid using inflammable objects in their homes. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
