Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The takeover of Arik Air by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria has stalled investments in the carrier by foreign partners, investors in the airline said on Wednesday. Arik Air was taken over by AMCON in February 2017 on the grounds of the airlineâ€™s debt to financial institutions and had been under receivership since then. But AMCON, through its spokesperson, Jude Nwauzor, told our correspondent that the airline would have collapsed following its about N300bn debt to banks if the corporation had not intervened. Original investors in the airline told journalists in Abuja that since the takeover of Arik there had been reluctance by many foreign investors to invest in the carrier. Copyright PUNCH.
