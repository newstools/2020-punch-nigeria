Tony Okafor, Awka The Anambra State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, has placed a ban on members of its executive from campaigning for aspirants ahead of the 2021 governorship election. State chairman of the party, Chief Ndubuisi Nwobu, announced the ban on Wednesday, while receiving a governorship aspirant, Chief Wilson Udeh, at the party’s Secretariat in Awka, the state capital. He said, “Any official who attaches himself to a particular aspirant will sanctioned. It’s our resolve that officials of the party should remain neutral until after the primaries of the party when all of us shall come out in unison to support our candidate for the election. “By so doing, we shall not be factionslised before the main election. Experience has taught us that if we attach ourselves to individual aspirants, if our choice aspirant fails in the primaries, we will abandon the general cause because the person we are supporting is  no longer in contention. That should stop.” Nwobu assured all aspirants of a level playing field; transparent and credible primaries. In his address, the aspirant, Wilson Udeh, a United States based lawyer and architect said, “I have not come here to promise you that I will build 21 universities in the state if elected. That’s not why I’m here. But all I will tell you today is that if elected governor in 2021, ugly faces in this state will be made beautiful and happy.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
