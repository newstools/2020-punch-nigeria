Adelani Adepegba The Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, has urged the troops not to be distracted by the moves by the International Criminal Court  to investigate the military for  war crimes  and crimes against humanity. He advised the troops to work hard and be guided by the constitution, the Rules of Engagement, the Code of Conduct and the Standing Operating Procedures for all Nigerian Army Operations. Buratai said this in a statement on Saturday, by the acting Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.Gen. Sagir Musa. This  followed the announcement by the ICC Prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda,  on Friday, that preliminary investigations  indicate that the military and Boko Haram insurgents  engaged in  rape and murder and also  directed  attacks against the civilian population and individual civilians not taking direct part in hostilities. Amnesty International had earlier accused the military and insurgents of killing  many aged citizens at disproportionate levels due to their inability to flee attacks. Buratai said, “There was no doubt that such statement and instigation could distract the Nigerian  troops with its demoralising effects.” He said it could have negative consequences on troops’ morale, interest in military service by Nigerians and cause  severe setback to all internal security operations. The COAS  enjoined the troops to fully concentrate on the final defeat of Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists groups “which is in sight.” Copyright PUNCH.
