Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has commended the Appeal Court for declaring Isaac Abbot-Ogbobula as the authentic caretaker committee chairman. The party said, by this ruling, the court has restored sanity in the party. Briefing newsmen at the APC Secretariat, in Port Harcourt, on Wednesday, Abbot-Ogbobula said with this ruling, all committed members of the party will now work together to move it forward. He said, “We commend the Justices of the Court of Appeal for the very erudite judgment delivered yesterday particularly for restoring sanity and more significantly, sending a clear message to lower courts to desist from unnecessarily meddling in the internal affairs of political parties and stop usurping the constitutionally vested powers and functions on Party organs.” “We must start to seriously interrogate the policies, programmes and activities of the state governor and invariably the application of State resources.” The party chairman also expressed APC’s lack of confidence in the ability of the Rivers State Independent Electoral Commission to conduct credible local government elections scheduled for April 2021. He also berated the Governor Nyesom Wike-led administration for allegedly failing to empower Rivers youths to contribute meaningfully to the development of the state. Copyright PUNCH.
