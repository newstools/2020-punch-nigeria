This was contained in a statement titled, “CUPP Mourns Labour Party National Chairman”, signed by the Coalition’s Co-Spokesperson, Mark Adebayo. The statement read in part, “We received the sudden death of Alhaji A. A. Salam with utter shock and total disbelief. A. A. Salam was a major pillar and voice who formed the CUPP and remained committed to its ideals until he breathed his last. “A very accommodating, intelligent, experienced, generous and patriotic leader, A. A. Salam was a true democrat and a fighter for justice. He was a father to all and always focused on anything he believed was right and just. “He was always available whenever his leadership and experience were needed and never shirked any responsibility he was assigned to. “Alhaji Salam was a man with a good spirit, caring, loving and always positive. His doors were always open to all irrespective of different political persuasions. We have lost a giant in the political space of Nigeria.”
