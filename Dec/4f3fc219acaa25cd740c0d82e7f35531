Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has said his criticism of the National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party, should not be misunderstood. The governor maintained that since he lacks the capacity to decamp to another political party, particularly, the All Progressives Congress, he will continue to speak out against perceived abnormalities in the PDP. Wike gave the clarification when friends and political associates paid him a surprise visit, to felicitate with him and his wife, Suzzette, on his birthday at the Government House, Port Harcourt, Sunday night. Wike, in a statement by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, said as a founding member of the PDP, he would continue to speak against whatever is militating against the progress of the party, irrespective of who is in charge of the NWC. Wike vowed to continue to stand on the path of truth to defend the interest of the state. According to him, anyone who is opposed to the interest of Rivers state will never be considered as his friend. He dismissed insinuations that he is concentrating development in Port Harcourt, the State capital. He said, “I want to challenged anyone to tell me which local government that you can’t find the presence of our government. I can tell you exactly what we’re doing in each local government.” Speaking on behalf of the Rivers State Executive Council, the Deputy Governor, Dr Ipalibo Banigo, said Wike had been a friend and leader who was focused, vibrant, and determined to fulfil his promises to Rivers people.
