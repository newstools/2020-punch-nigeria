Sodiq Oyeleke Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has congratulated Nigerian-born boxer, Anthony Joshua, over his victory against Kubrat Pulev Saturday night. The governor in a Facebook post on Sunday said Joshua’s victory is a justification for the state government’s investment in sports. Abiodun also said the boxer’s victory has brought pride to Ogun State where he hails from. He said, “AJ’s victory gives us, Ogun State people immeasurable joy, as the IBF, WBA and WBO titleholder retained his place at his outing against Kubrat Pulev yesterday. “So, this is to congratulate, on behalf of the good people of the Gateway State, our very own Anthony Joshua on the world-celebrated victory that has brought us pride and a justification for our investment in sports and youth development.”  Joshua knocked out Bulgarian boxer, Kubrat Pulev, in the ninth round of their world title bout at the SSE Arena, Wembley, to retain his WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, and IBO heavyweight titles. The fight is Joshua’s first since reclaiming his belts from Andy Ruiz in December 2019 in Saudi Arabia. Pulev has been unbeaten in his last eight fights since losing via knockout to Wladimir Klitschko in 2014. The 39-year-old won 28 of his previous 29 with 14 by way of knockout. South African referee Deon Dwarte stopped the fight after the ninth round knockdown. Joshua’s victory sets up a potential all-British heavyweight unification bout against Tyson Fury in 2021.
