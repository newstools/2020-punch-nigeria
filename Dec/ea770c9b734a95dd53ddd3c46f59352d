Daniels Igoni Yenagoa The Bayelsa State Government has approved the recommencement of construction work on the abandoned 22-kilometer Igbogene-AIT Ring Road project in Yenagoa, the state capital, from January 2021. According to the Commissioner for Information, Orientation and Strategy, Ayibaina Duba, the decision was taken during the State Executive Council meeting at the Government House, Yenagoa, on Wednesday. The road project, which was intended to serve as a bypass from the Mbiama-Yenagoa Road, was started in 2013 by the administration of former governor Seriake Dickson but was eventually abandoned. Shedding more light on the council decision, the Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Moses Teibowei, said construction would re-commence from the second week of January 2021 and would cost the state over N22bn. He said the job would be completed within a duration of 24 months, adding that the Governor Douye Diri administration was desirous of improving on the state’s infrastructure. Teibowei also spoke on the ongoing Edepie-Etegwe roundabout expansion project, stating that phase one was almost completed while phase two, which involved the building of a retaining wall and sand filling near the Etegwe bridge would commence soon. He said this would prevent encroachment and illegal trading on government’s right-of-way as well as beautify and make the area motorable. Copyright PUNCH.
