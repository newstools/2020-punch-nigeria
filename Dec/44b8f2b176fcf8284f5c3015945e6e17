John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party, has accused the All-Progressives Congress of engaging in a conspiracy of silence over Nigeria’s growing spate of insecurity. It also charged the ruling party to come clean of its alleged ties to bandits and criminal gangs. This was contained in a statement titled: “Killings: PDP Calls Out APC Over Conspiracy of Silence…Says APC Is Architect of Buhari’s Misrule,” signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, on Tuesday. The PDP said by not taking the initiative to impress it upon the President to cut short his “unnecessary holiday” and make efforts to  rescue the abducted 500 Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State students, the APC has again shown that it is a party of ‘political bandits’, which has no iota of concern for the wellbeing of Nigerians. Ologbondiyan said, “The APC leaders must explain their interests in acts of violence and terrorism ravaging our country, particularly, given that many of them, including some state governors, had admitted establishing contacts with and even paying ransom to bandits.” In a separate statement which was signed by the Chairman Caretaker / Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee, of the All progressives Congress, Mai Mala Buni, the party expressed sadness over the abduction. Buni, in the statement he issued on Tuesday, said, “As the Buhari administration works harder to improve the security situation in the country, the APC calls on the nation’s security agencies to dig deeper and do better by ensuring that our students can go to school safely and learn all across the country.” Copyright PUNCH.
