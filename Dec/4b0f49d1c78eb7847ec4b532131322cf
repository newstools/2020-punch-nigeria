Temiloluwa O’Peters In an attempt to guarantee a same-day delivery especially for priority and time-sensitive packages, Dellyman, a logistics marketplace has set its target to reach between 150,000 to 200,000 daily deliveries in the next 48 to 60 months. According to a statement issued by the firm on Wednesday, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Dellyman, Dare Ojo-Bello, noted that the company sought to confront the challenges in the last mile logistics industry head-on. Speaking at a partners’ forum on Tuesday, he said the company would achieve this by guaranteeing same-day delivery for anyone wishing to move packages in Nigeria and across the African continent. “Our target and growth is to reach 50,000 to 80,000 deliveries in 18 to 36 months and 10,000 to 30,000 deliveries per day within the next 12 months,” he said. Ojo-Bello however noted that the industry had not given the kind of assurances that the customers needed to be able to trust last mile providers a bit more. He said this could be as a result of no consumer protection regulations and/or that they are not well enforced. Copyright PUNCH.
