Joseph OlaoluwaSkipAds by Dana Air has apologised to affected passengers at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, who were stranded on Friday, as three scheduled flights by the airline were delayed. In a statement on Sunday by the airline spokesman, Mr Kingsley Ezenwa, it promised to offer new tickets to all affected passengers and refunds for those who did not want to be rescheduled. It explained that two of its aircraft in Lagos and Abuja were grounded, hence the delay in flights. The statement read thus, “On Friday 18, and Saturday 19, December 2020, two of our aircraft became unserviceable in Lagos and Abuja respectively, compelling us to ground both aircraft in line with our strict safety standards and global best practices. “While our maintenance team have however been deployed to conduct proper checks on both aircraft, we wish to reassure our guests and crew that their safety will continue to be our priority in all circumstances and we will stop at nothing to guarantee this. “To compensate for this regrettable service failure, we are offering free tickets to all our guests on the affected flights, while full refunds will be made available to guests who do not prefer to be rescheduled.” It also promised travellers better communication, improved customer service delivery and reliability in the future.
