Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin THE Edo State Police Command has said it has not been briefed about development relating to the abduction of passenger on Tuesday along the dreaded Benin-Auchi Road. The suspected gunmen kidnapped unspecified number of passengers after attacking an Abuja-bound commercial bus travelling from Benin between Ehor and Iruekpen. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Chidi Nwabuzor, said he had not been briefed of the development when he was contacted by journalists. “I am not aware of it. Some incidents are not reported and even when they are, because they are from local government divisions, they do not get to us immediately. “So, give us some time for us to get in touch with the officers and men in the affected area,” Nwabuzor said. According to eyewitnesses, several of the passengers “were forcefully taken into the bush‎” after the bus conveying them was forced to stop by the gunmen. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
