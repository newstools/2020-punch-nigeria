Johnson Okafor European shares on Tuesday made a positive start to the month following record-breaking gains in November, with optimism around a coronavirus vaccine strengthening the case for an economic recovery. After a day’s dip, when investors took some profits, the pan-European STOXX 600 index was back in the black, up 0.8 per cent. The index ended November with gains of nearly 14 per cent. However, Stanhope Capital’s Chief Investment Officer Jonathan Bell warned it may be difficult to keep up November’s rally, given how high valuations are, according to Reuters. “Going to December there’ll be little bit of a pause despite all the good news surrounding vaccines,” Bell said, also highlighting the pressure on GDP from coronavirus-induced lockdowns put in place last month. Data on Tuesday showed lockdowns in France and Italy slowed manufacturing activity in November. But keeping hopes of economic recovery alive, a business survey echoed official numbers from a day earlier which showed robust growth in China’s factory activity. Investors, however, may have already started to price in consistently good data from China, Bell said. On the Brexit front, the European Union will launch contingency measures on Wednesday or Thursday, if it is unable to reach an agreement by then with Britain, a senior EU diplomat said. UK’s Brexit supremo, Michael Gove said on Tuesday talks are still stuck on fishing, governance rules and dispute resolution. After marking its best month in over three decades, London’s blue-chip index rallied 1.5 per cent to lead gains among regional peers, attempting to make up last session’s losses. Copyright PUNCH.
