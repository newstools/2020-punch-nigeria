Ada Wodu, Calabar A suspected child trafficker, Maureen Awokara, has been handed over to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons. Awokara was arrested with a three-week-old baby by the marine patrol team of the Nigeria Immigration Service in Cross River State on December 19 on the high sea. Confirming the handover, the Cross River State Comptroller of Immigration, James Ezugwu, said, “We have handed over the suspect to NAPTIP. From our preliminary investigation, we suspect that she was involved in child trafficking. NAPTIP should be able to carry out further investigation.” The Immigration boss said Awokara, who claimed to be a native of Imo State, told stories about the owner of the child that did not add up. The suspect claimed that the baby belongs to her younger sister, who could not take care of her after delivery. Efforts to contact the owner of the phone number she provided proved futile as the lines did not connect. She also said she had been married for 18 years but could not have a baby of her own.
