Tukur Muntari, Kano The Independent Electoral Commission is set to review its regulations and guidelines for political parties to accommodate COVID-19 protocols. The INEC Deputy Director, (Election and Monitoring), Shehu Wahab, disclosed this at the opening of a retreat on COVID-19 protocols for INEC officers in Kano, on Wednesday. The retreat was organised by commission with support from European Centre for Electoral Support (ECES). Wahab said the retreat was aimed at reviewing the commission’s guidelines to accommodate COVID-19 protocols and other related matters to endure compliance. Earlier in his remarks, ECES project Coordinator, Mr. Hamza Fass-Fihri, described the retreat as timely. He said, “Political parties are the primary stakeholders in the political system and their effective operations within the context of existing legal frameworks are crucial to the credibility of the electoral process and outcomes, and by extension the stability of the democratic system. “However, the onslaught of COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on every facet of national life including how democracy must work. “It means actors within the political system can no longer do things as usual, because of the ravaging impacts of the pandemic especially on mass-based activities such as elections and political parties’ activities.” Copyright PUNCH.
