Olufemi Olaniyi, Ibadan A former Minister of Transport, Chief Ebenezer Babatope, has appealed to all members of the Peoples Democratic Party in the South-West to cooperate with the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, as he leads the effort to reposition the party in the zone. He urged former Ekiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose, and other aggrieved members of the party to sheath their swords and give peace a chance. Babatope, who is a member of the PDP Board of Trustees said in an interview with our correspondent, in Ibadan on Tuesday. He said, “As far as some of us who are elders and who belong to the PDP Elders Group led by Chief Olabode Ibikunle George are concerned, we believe that there is no need for anybody to create a crisis within the party. The normal party convention in the PDP is that, like the South-West where we are not in power, the governor there becomes the leader of the party in the region. “So, that is where we stand. We recognise Governor Seyi Makinde as the man to lead the party to victory in the South-West. “Fayose can’t be the leader of the party now. Seyi Makinde is the person now and he is the one that will be reporting activities of the party in the South West to the National Caucus  and the NWC in Abuja.” Copyright PUNCH.
