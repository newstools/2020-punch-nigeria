Friday Olokor, Abuja The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria has called on the Federal Government to do more in addressing the urgent challenges of insecurity, poverty and unemployment in Nigeria. The organisation also urged Nigerians to embrace the joy of Christmas and key into the spirit of the new beginning it symbolises. The PFN told Nigerians to keep hope alive despite the challenges facing the world, assuring them in spite of the economic downturn and wave of insecurity, “God’s plan for Nigeria will prevail.” The President of the PFN, Rev. Dr. Felix Omobude, said these in his Christmas message on Friday. According to him, it was by grace of God that the impact of COVID -19 in Nigeria has not been as devastating as it had been projected by experts. Omobude appreciated God for His faithfulness in the lives of Nigerians, especially in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Omobude appealed to all Nigerians to continue to abide by the COVID-19 protocols recommended by the relevant authorities, especially in the face of the second wave of infections. “The Federal Government needs to do more in addressing the urgent challenges of insecurity, poverty and unemployment in Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
