Olaide Oyelude, Katsina The Peoples Democratic Party in Katsina State on Monday urged residents of the state to seek spiritual means to ensure the safe return of over 300 students abducted by bandits from Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, last Friday. The party also said the students’ abduction had exposed the failure of governments at both the state and at the federal levels over the handling of the security challenges in the state. In a statement on Monday in Katsina by the party’s chairman in the state, Salisu Majigiri, asked the security forces to review the security architecture in the state. The statement partly read, “The kidnap of 333 of students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, who are in captivity mostly below the age of 18, is the hallmark of this dastardly act by kidnappers. “We are, therefore, appealing to all able-bodied men and women of Katsina State to embark on fasting and offer prayers to Allah , SWT, as a means of seeking succour from him to bring an end to this menace. We also pray that these innocent children are reunited with their families safely. “We are also calling on governments, both state and federal to live up to their constitutional responsibilities enshrined in the Nigerian constitution, 1999 under chapter 11 ( Fundamental objectives principles of state policy), section 14 (2b) the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.
