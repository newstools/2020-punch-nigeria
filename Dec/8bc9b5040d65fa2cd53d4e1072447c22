Sodiq Oyeleke The lawmaker representing Epe Federal Constituency, in the House of Representatives, Wale Raji, has urged his constituents not to allow themselves to be deceived during the Lagos East bye-election scheduled for Saturday, December 5. He urged them to vote for the All Progressives Congress candidate, Tokunbo Abiru.
