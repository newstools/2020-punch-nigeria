Umar Muhammed, Lafia Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has told local government chairmen in the state to pay staff salaries in order to ameliorate the suffering of workers and their families. The governor spoke while receiving a delegation of local government chairmen, led by the chairman of Lafia Local Government Area, Mr Aminu Mauzu, in the Government House, Lafia, on Monday. The council chairmen were in Lafia to commiserate with the governor over the death of the state APC chairman, the late Philip Shekwo. The delegation also congratulated the governor over the safe delivery of a set of twins by his wife, Farida, last week. Sule expressed displeasure over the news that some local governments in the state were still owing salaries. He said, “Whatever may be the case, you must pay your staff salaries, it is very important, you have to do so.” He cautioned the chairmen against illegal staff recruitment noting that recruitment of staff “remains the responsibility of the state government.” Sule stressed that the only time council chairmen would be allowed to employ staff was when the current embargo on recruitments were lifted. Earlier, Muazu said he and his colleagues were in government house to condole with the governor over the death of the state APC chairman. Copyright PUNCH.
