Wale Oyewale, Ibadan The Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, has said that the death of his mother, Madam Abigail Omojolagbe, has further confirmed to him the fact that human’s stay on earth is ephemeral. Governor Makinde, during his vote of thanks at the Thanksgiving Service in honour of his late mother, said no matter how long a human being lives, the reality of death was unmistakable. The Thanksgiving Service, held at the Cathedral of St. Paul, Yemetu, Ibadan, had in attendance top government functionaries, friends and political associates of the governor and his siblings. The governor said, “I thank God for the kind of life my mother lived. I sat down after my mum passed away to do some calculations to know the number of days she spent on earth. I discovered she spent exactly 29,509 days. We can think the days are long; but it will end one day. That’s just the truth. “Even, if anyone will spend 100 years on earth, such person will spend about 36,000 days. So, it will end one day. The word of the Lord would not go without being fulfilled on any of us. “We really appreciate your support and thank you very much.” In his sermon, the Assistant Priest of St. Pauls Anglican Church, Yemetu, Rev. O.J. Alo, urged the congregation to always remember that death could come any time, adding that every living soul shall taste death one day. In attendance on the occasion are the Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Rauf Olaniyan, and his wife, Prof. Bolanle; the SSG, Mrs. Olubamiwo Adeosun, and her husband, Akinjide; the Chief of Staff to Governor Makinde, Chief Oyebisi Ilaka; Prelate Emeritus, Methodist Church of Nigeria, Sunday Makinde, and Venerable Samuel Osungbeju of the Yemetu Church, Ibadan
