Chukwudi Akasike AHEAD of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo election, a pan-Igbo sociopolitical group, the South-East Revival Group has declared support for the candidature of Prof. George Obiozor, for the position of President General of the apex Igbo body. The President and National Coordinator of the group, Chief Willy Ezugwu, in a statement on Tuesday urged all Igbo groups and individuals to throw their weight behind Obiozor, a former Nigerian ambassador to Israel and the United States of America. “Looking at the local and international pedigree of Ambassador George Obiozor, a professor and diplomat of unimpeachable character, Ndigbo should not search further for the next President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide,” the statement reads in part. SERG maintained that with the exposure of Obiozor, a former Director-General of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, he would carry Igbo leaders along in his administration and would not thread on the selfish path of some leadership before him. “Thus far, in view of the quest to produce the next Nigerian President of South-East extraction, our search for a credible and acceptable Ohanaeze leader stopped at the doorsteps of Ambassador George Obiozor,” the group said.
