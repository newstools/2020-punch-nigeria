Sodiq Oyeleke Shops and valuable goods were on Sunday damaged when fire gutted the Ketu Plank Market, Lagos State on Sunday. The Lagos State Emergency Management confirmed the incident, adding that no life was lost. The Director-General of LASEMA, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, said the cause of the fire incident could not be ascertained as of the time of filing this report. He said, “Emergency responders comprising of LASEMA Response Team and the Lagos State Fire Service have curtailed the raging inferno at Ketu Plank Market on Demurin Street, Ketu, Lagos. “The cause of the fire incident which reportedly started from one part of the market is yet to be ascertained, however, it is evident that there is extensive damage with valuable goods having been destroyed by the fire. “Fortunately, no lives were lost in the inferno which has been brought under control and dampened down.” In another part of Lagos, Oke-Osanyintolu said LASEMA Response Unit recovered a trailer conveying a 40ft container that ran over a culvert at Mile 2 inward Kirikri earlier on Sunday. He added, “Investigation by the LRT determined that the accident was a result of a mechanical error (brake failure) of the trailer. “No loss of life, nor injuries were recorded in the incident where the LRT, LASTMA, and men of the Nigerian Police were responders. “The affected Trailer has been evacuated off the road to a layby with aid of the agency’s heavy-duty equipment.”
