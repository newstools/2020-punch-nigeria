Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Most fire incidents in government offices are as a result of the failure to plan and implement fire preventive and safety measures, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said on Wednesday. Ahmed said this at the inauguration of a fire station at the Treasury House building housing the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation in Abuja. Represented by the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Ahmed Ali, the finance minister said, “Fire safety at the work place is the foremost consideration in human resources management. “Of recent, fire incidents have been reported in many government offices and in most cases such incidents were as result of failure to plan and implement fire preventive and safety measures.” She said the inauguration of the fire station among other infrastructural development projects embarked on by the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation were in tandem with the policy of government to ensure safety in every workplace and its environs. The Account-General of the Federation, Ibrahim Idris, said there was little awareness about fire safety, as part of the plea of his agency was to ensure that the Federal Fire Service and all fire commands around the country were adequately equipped.
