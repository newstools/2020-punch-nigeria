Ade Adesomoju, Abuja Seven persons accused of complicity in the 2017 arson and killing of some indigenes in Idumuje-Ugboko in Delta State, on Thursday, kicked against their trial at the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court. The defendants, who were arraigned before Justice Okon Abang on November 2, 2020, informed the judge on Thursday that they had filed an application for the transfer of the case to the Asaba division of the court. The defendants are Nwochie Light, Aikhomo Omezi, Okey Ifejoku, Godwin Aniemeke, Nonso Omefe, Dennis Nwoko and Emeka Bidoku. The Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation alleged that the defendants, in May 2017, unleashed terror on the Idumuje-Ugboko community of Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State. The prosecution alleged that the defendants torched houses in the community and one Cyprian Kumaorun was killed in the process. The defendants pleaded not guilty when they were arraigned on November 2, 2020. At the resumed hearing of the case on Thursday, defence lawyers informed the court that they wanted the case transferred to Asaba or other places such as Edo, Bayelsa, Rivers or Anambra State. But the prosecuting counsel, Mr Shuaibu Labaran, sought an adjournment to enable him to respond to the defendantsâ€™ application for transfer of the case. The judge adjourned till Friday for the hearing of the application.
