Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo GUNMEN on Sunday opened fire on some IDP returnees at Tor-Iorshaegh in Wukari Local Government Area of Taraba State. An eyewitness, Mr Donald Meer, told our correspondent on the phone that gunmen suspected to be Jukun militia attacked the village at about 10pm killing the four internally displaced persons after they had returned to the area. Meer, who named those killed as Godwin Meer, Terlumun Mdooga Mbakpenev, Alfred Sylvanus Mchivga and Ayar Chia, said the attackers fled the scene in two vehicles before the arrival soldiers stationed in the area. The villagers, who fled the Jukun/Tiv crisis, had returned to the area last Thursday after one year and seven months in IDPs camps in the neighbouring Benue State. President General, Tiv Cultural and Social Association, Taraba State, Chief Joshua Ayagwa, who confirmed the attack and killing of four persons, said the incident had been reported to security agencies. Ayagwa called on Governor Darius Ishaku to provide security for the IDP returnees. “The returnees officially wrote to the security agencies before returning and they have a responsibility to protect them,” he said. The Police Public Relations Officer, David Misal, neither picked calls neither made to his line for confirmation nor replied a text message sent to him. Meanwhile, the Chairman, Tiv Traditional Leaders Council and the Ter Tiv Bali, Zaki David Gbaa, condemned the attack and killing of Tiv IDPs returnees. Gbaa described the attack and killing as a serious setback to the peace initiative of Governor Darius Ishaku, who had been preaching peaceful coexistence. Copyright PUNCH.
