John Alechenu, Abuja The Progressives Governors’ Forum has expressed willingness to work with other governors across party lines to find lasting solutions to Nigeria’s security challenges. The forum which is the umbrella body of governors elected on the platform the All Progressives Congress said this in a statement titled, “Rescue of Abducted GSSS Kankara Students,” signed by its Chairman, Abubakar Bagudu, in Abuja, on Sunday. Bagudu said, “We will ensure that, as leaders, we are able to work in harmony with all governors, political and non-political leaders for the restoration of peace across all parts of the country, irrespective of any difference. “Nigeria belongs to all Nigerians and must be secured as ‘one indivisible and indissoluble sovereign nation under God as affirmed by the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” The PGF joined the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), the families of abducted students at Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State, people and government of Katsina State, and all Nigerians to celebrate the rescue and return of all the abducted students of the school. The statement read in part, “The rescue, once more attests to the capacity and competence of Nigerian security agencies to protect, defend and secure the country. “Given the important role of our security agencies and other non-governmental leaders in the process that rescued our Kankara school children, it demonstrates that efforts to resolve our national security problem is a responsibility that requires united, resolute and prompt responses.” Copyright PUNCH.
