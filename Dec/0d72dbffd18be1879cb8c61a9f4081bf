Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Prince Uche Secondus, has lamented the state of insecurity in the country. He said that the regime of Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) and the All Progressives Congress have “thrown the country into confusion, grieve, pain, and sorrow”. He stated this during the inauguration of four roads in Bauchi State worth N13.6 billion, alongside Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal. Secondus called on Buhari to immediately secure the release of the 330 abducted schoolboys in his home state, Katsina. He said, “Today is one day that we never looked up to. It is a moment of confusion, grief, and pain and sorrow in our dear country. “You know that Nigeria is currently undergoing serious distress and now in Bauchi, the governor is putting smiles on the faces of the people in terms of massive transformation of the state capital and other cities of Bauchi State. “Permit me to take one minute for us to observe a minute silence for those that have been killed, especially the farmers, and also to pray for our young ones, the students that were kidnapped in Katsina State. “All we can say is that we want back our boys from Katsina State both here, at the national and international levels, and am quite sure, President Buhari will want back, our boys from Katsina State.” The National Chairman said the PDP is intact and ready to take over the mantle of leadership of the country to rescue it from the quagmire it is in at the moment. “Our party is intact, our party is united for the rescue of our nation, Nigeria. You can see the situation we find ourselves now in Nigeria. Nigeria is in crisis, Nigeria is confused. “The only hope is that the PDP will rescue Nigeria when the time comes by the special grace of God,” he stated.
