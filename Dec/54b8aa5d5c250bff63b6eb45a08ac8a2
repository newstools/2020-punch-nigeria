Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government has developed a flood control memo for the country and is set to present the document to the National Economic Council, including the possibility of draining River Niger. Minister of Environment, Mohammed Mahmood, announced this at the 14th National Stakeholders Forum organised by the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency in Abuja. Mahmood said on Friday that the memo and possible draining of River Niger were vital considering the devastating impact of flood across the country. He said the Federal Government was very concerned and serious about flooding, as its menace had destroyed lives and properties, and had also caused agricultural setback in Nigeria. The minister said, “The Federal Ministry of Environment, very soon will be presenting a memo to the National Economic Council being chaired by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo, on flood control including the possibility or not of draining River Niger.” Mahmood, who spoke on the theme, “Flood disasters: An imperative for environmental government,” said it was important for stakeholders to discuss the matter as the nation had recorded colossal level of damage, destruction of properties and loss of lives due to flood. He said the flood situation in Nigeria was a very serious problem but noted that it could be managed and controlled, adding that the forum was aimed at finding practical solutions to problems associated with flood. The Director-General, NESREA, Aliyu Jauro, said his agency would continue to enforce measures that would help curb the menace associated with flooding across the country. Copyright PUNCH.
