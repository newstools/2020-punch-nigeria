Sunday Aborisade, Abuja President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, said on Wednesday that the National Assembly would ensure that the new electoral Act would be used to conduct elections slated for next years and beyond. Lawan stated this at a public hearing jointly organised by the National Assembly Joint Committee on INEC and Electoral Matters. The event was meant for stakeholders’ input on “a bill for an Act to Repeal the Electoral Act No. 6  2010(as amended) and enact the Independent National Electoral Commission Act 2020.” The Independent National Electoral Commission will conduct governorship elections in Anambra, Ekiti and Osun states before the 2023 general elections. Lawan said, “I want to assure Nigerians that we will do whatever it takes to give Nigerian’s a befitting electoral act that would ensure a credible, transparent elections, outcomes even before 2023.” The Senate President seized the occasion to reiterate his earlier promise that the National Assembly would work hard to ensure that the Electoral Reforms Bill was passed by the first quarter of 2021. He said, “People may chose to accuse us for any other thing but not what we do here.” Copyright PUNCH.
