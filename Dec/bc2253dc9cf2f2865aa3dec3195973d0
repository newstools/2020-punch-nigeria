Sodiq Oyeleke Lagos State Government would take over the control of Apapa gridlock from the Federal Task Force, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said. He said this on Monday when he visited the Apapa area of the state to assess the situation on the ground in preparation for the takeover of the management of the Apapa traffic. The governor said dedicated officers from Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, and policemen from Area B would take over the traffic control. He said, “Now, there is a process that is starting in which the state government needs to take over that task force. “The State government is to set up a seamless operation to have a team of LASTMA about 400 to 500, dedicated to Apapa gridlock, have a team of policemen from Area B dedicated to the same gridlock. “We are trying to bring about comprehensive metrics where all the stakeholders in Apapa understand and appreciate the various role that everybody needs to play. And let everybody identify and solve it. “There have been accusations around cabal collecting money from operators and accusations around being hijacked by some people and there have also been counter-accusations. “As a government, we don’t own the Port, but we have a responsibility to our citizens. “It is part of ensuring that we reduce the ease of doing process, if businesses are expensive to run they will pass the the cost to the customers. “It is a process and we will not say that we have all the solutions but we have seen the process, again we have see that we can improve this process and we have identified the stakeholders.”
