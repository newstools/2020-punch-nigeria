Olaide Oyelude, Katsina The new President of the National Association of Nigerian Students, Sunday Asefon, was in Katsina on Saturday where he met with Governor Aminu Masari and some of the freed students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara. Asefon said he travelled to Katsina when he learnt of the students’ abduction with the intention to remain in the state until their abductors release them. The NANS president, however, said he was happy to learn of their release shortly before he reached Katsina. He enjoined the students not to be distracted by the experience but to focus on their education. Asefon, in a statement issued in Katsina on Saturday, said, “I was in Ekiti State when the news of the kidnapped students was confirmed. As a revolutionary president of NANS, I travelled through the road to Katsina State from Ekiti State. “I vowed I won’t leave Katsina State until the students are rescued. To God be the glory, the students were rescued on time. The welfare and safety of Nigerian students across all the 36 states and in diasporas is my priority. I will continue to advocate for the welfare of everyone called students in Nigeria.
