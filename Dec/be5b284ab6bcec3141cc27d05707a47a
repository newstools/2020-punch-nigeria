Gbenga Adeniji The Lagos State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party has described Saturday’s senatorial and House of Assembly bye-elections in the state as a charade, accusing the electoral body of only allocating votes to the All Progressives Congress which won the elections. The party Chairman,  Adedeji Doherty, said relevant lessons had been learnt by the PDP and its stakeholders, assuring that Lagos would be ‘rescued’ from the APC governing the state for over 20 years. He said, “We all know that the voter apathy alone negates the votes allotted to the APC, as less than 10 per cent of the voters in Lagos State took part in the elections. “Furthermore, in spite of the lack of interest in the elections by Lagosians, we are all aware of the massive vote buying by the APC using state funds.” Reacting, the Lagos APC said the PDP’s claim regarding the poll was a comic relief from the recent pressure and challenges arising from preparations for the election. A statement by the party’s Spokesperson, Mr Seye Oladejo, said, “The age-long disharmony and lack of coordination in the PDP effectively laid the foundation for the permanent trouncing of the opposition party in Lagos State. “While they were busy conducting fake personal opinion polls, the ruling APC was reaching out to the voters with life-changing programmes, manifestos and policies relevant to the challenges of the day. However, we emphatise with Doherty who must still be dazed by the total annihilation.” Copyright PUNCH.
