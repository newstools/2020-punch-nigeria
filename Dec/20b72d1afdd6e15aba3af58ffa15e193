Joe Komolafe confirmed the incident on Saturday and said another would-have-been victim was rescued by the corps. He said the Ekiti State Security Network Agency codenamed Amotekun Corps and the police command in the state jointly engaged the gunmen before one of the travellers was rescued while the other was abducted. Komolafe said in Ado-Ekiti that the kidnappers were suspected herdsmen. He said the assailants shot at the vehicle in which the victims were travelling on Friday but were confronted by men of the Amotekun Corps and the police. “According to information made available to us, the victims were ambushed at a bad spot and when they were trying to make a detour to escape, another set of gunmen came out from the bush from behind them and started shooting at the vehicle from both ends. “The victims hurriedly opened the vehicle and ran into the bush in different directions.
