John Alechenu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party has asked the All Progressives Congress to reign in bandits currently terrorizing Nigerians across the country. The opposition party said our nation can no longer cope with the daily kidnappings and wanton killing of innocent Nigerians by outlaws who have been emboldened by the favourable treatment they were receiving from the government of the day. This was contained in a statement titled, “PDP To APC: Rein In Your Bandits Now,” signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, on Monday. It read in part, “The PDP has asked the APC to immediately rein in its ‘bandits’ as our nation can no longer cope with the daily marauding, kidnapping and wanton killings by these outlaws. “The APC further betrayed its complicity by always evading demands by Nigerians to explain the whereabouts of the bandits it imported as political mercenaries to unleash violence and help it muscle the 2019 general election. “Moreover, the APC had further betrayed its links through its manifest show of sympathy to terrorists and bandits, failure to promptly and forcefully condemn their activities as well as its attack on anybody, who condemn acts of terrorism or demand for the release of abductees.” A response from the APC to the allegations was still being awaited as at the time of filing this report.
