Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The Aju Ameacho ruling clan has nominated Prince Opaluwa Okoliko to become the next Attah Igala in Kogi State. The stool became vacant following the death of Idakwo Michael Ameh Oboni a few months ago. Okoliko had worked in the banking, aviation and education sectors over the years. The representatives of the ruling house, Chief Ogobi Emeje and Alhaji Ibrahim Abutu, while speaking to journalist in Lokoja, said the nomination followed consultations among members of the clan, adding that the decision was in line with Kogi State Government’s gazette on the selection of the Attah Igala. Okoliko has also been endorsed and recommended by elders and members of four other ruling houses, which are Aju Ameacho, Aju Akogu, Aju Akwu and Aju Ocholi. The elder brother of Okoliko, Prince Opaluwa Ayegba, endorsed the nomination. Abutu, who spoke on behalf of the Aju Ameacho ruling clan, said the clan was robbed of the throne in 1956 when it presented Okoliko’s grandfather, Prince Opaluwa Oguche, for the stool after going through the rituals of ascension, but Aliyu Obaje was installed from Aju Akwu ruling clan. The same scenario, according to him, was played out in 2013, when the Aju Ameacho clan was also denied when it presented Okoliko’s father, Peter Opaluwa, but Oboni was later installed from the Aju Ocholi ruling clan.
