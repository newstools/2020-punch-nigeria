Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri A member of the Board of Trustees of the People Democratic Party, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, has come under attack for endorsing the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, for a second term. Iwuanyanwu, who is also the chairman, the PDP Elder’s council, had at a reception held in Uzodimma’s honour by Owerri zone, assured him that the people of the zone would support him should he decide to seek a reelection in 2023. The zonal PDP chapter and the Apex socio-cultural organisation, Olu Owerri, flayed the elder statesman for adopting Uzodimma. The President General of the organization, Chief Martin Opara, said, Iwuanyanwu expressed a personal opinion which did not reflect the majority opinion in the nine Local Government Areas that make up Owerri zone. Also, in a statement signed by the Zonal PDP Publicity Secretary, Kizzito Onuoha, the party said, “It is unfortunate and quite embarrassing that chief Iwuanyanwu who should have been at the very forefront of the call for strict adherence to the Imo charter of equity and total balancing in the context of Imo political tripod, could allow himself to be used as an instrument of sabotage to his people of Owerri zone.” “We therefore totally and completely distance and disassociate ourselves from Iwuanyanwu’s unfortunate speech as it does not represent our position, vision and interest and wish to state in very clear terms that Owerri zone is focused and determined more than ever before to ensure that the continued injustice meted to Owerri zone is put to an end.” Copyright PUNCH.
