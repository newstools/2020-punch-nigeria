Peter Dada, Akure The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the last governorship election in Ondo State, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, has expressed the assurance that he would become the governor of the state. Jegede, who lost October 10, 2020, Governorship Election to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu said all evidence before the election petition tribunal was enough to send the All Progressives Congress’ government away from the Alagbaka Government House. He added that the APC was already jittery about losing in the court. Jegede stated this on Tuesday in Akure, the state capital, during the inauguration of the newly built party secretariat. The Oyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, represented by the National Vice Chairman of the PDP Caretaker Committee, Chief Dayo Ogungbenro, inaugurated the new party secretariat. “The APC in the state is jittery and we shall take over soon,” Jegede said The state chairman of the party, Mr Fatai Adams charged the members across the 18 local government areas of the state, to be more committed and loyal to the party, declaring that the benefits that members would derive from the party, would henceforth depend on their contributions to the party. The secretariat was burnt down by some suspected hoodlums during the #EndSARS protest in October. However, it was gathered that the rebuilding of the secretariat, which was completed within two months, was single-handedly sponsored by a former governorship aspirant of the party in the last election, Mr Godday Erewa. Adams said, “This is the first time in the history of politics in Nigeria that a single individual, would build a secretariat of a party. “Whenever there is anything to be shared or appointments to be made, contributions of would-be beneficiaries would be put into consideration.”
