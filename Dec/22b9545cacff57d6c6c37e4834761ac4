Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress on Wednesday, expressed confidence that the case instituted against its victory, by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, in the October 10 state governorship election, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede SAN, will fail. Jegede, is challenging the outcome of the polls which the Independent National Electoral Commission, declared the APC candidate Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu SAN, winner on the grounds of electoral fraud and violence. The PDP candidate, had at a news conference in Akure, on Tuesday, expressed confidence that he would reclaim his “stolen mandate,” at the tribunal. Ondo State APC Director Media and Publicity, Mr. Steve Otaloro, while responding to Jegede’s comments, on Wednesday said, “The recent insinuation by Mr. Eyitayo Jegede that he will reclaim the Ondo State governorship election mandate given to Governor Akeredolu, at the election petition tribunal, is laughable. It reflects the embodiment of ignorance on his part. “In simple terms, the people of Ondo State have, freely, chosen between APC and other political parties in the state. Therefore, for Mr. Jegede who was strongly rejected at the election to be hopeful of reclaiming the said mandate at a court of law is a subject of wishful thinking. “Mr. Jegede and the PDP should continue to tell their fairy tales about how they wish the outcome of the tribunal verdict would be, but the good news is that they cannot be the judge in their own case.” Copyright PUNCH.
