Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Thursday, mourned the late Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmed Lemu. Buhari’s condolence message was contained in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled ‘Sheikh Lemu was a man of vast knowledge, says President Buhari’. Shehu quoted Buhari as describing the deceased as “an outstanding scholar, jurist, teacher and author who was endowed with knowledge of encyclopedic proportion.” He further quoted Buhari as saying that “with the death of Lemu, Nigeria and indeed Africa, has lost one of its greatest scholars of all time. “Lemu was one of the moderating voices of Islam who used wisdom in spreading knowledge, thereby portraying the religion in the brightest light. “The late Lemu’s contributions to religious education and the promotion of inter-faith dialogue and understanding were immeasurable.” READ ALSO: I apologise first during disagreements with my husband – Funke Akindele-Bello The presidential aide said Buhari praised what he called Lemu’s incredible humility and modesty, adding that the “pursuit of scholarship and knowledge was his primary preoccupation rather than material things of this world. “May Allah abundantly reward Lemu for his contributions to Islam and the promotion of inter-faith dialogue and understanding in our country during his worthy life on earth. May Almighty God forgive his gentle soul and reward his noble needs with aljanna. May God comfort his family at this trying time.”
