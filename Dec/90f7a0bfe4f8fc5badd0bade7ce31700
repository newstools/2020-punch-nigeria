Friday Olokor, Abuja No fewer than 20 Nigerian doctors have died from complications arising from COVID-19 in the last one week, the Nigeria Medical Association, said on Friday. The chairman of NMA (FCT chapter), Enema Amodu, who said this during a press conference in Abuja, noted that the victims included Consultants, Professors and some Resident Doctors, adding that the figures had kept increasing daily. ”For those of us in the health sector, we have lost quite a number of colleagues. Across the country, we have lost not less than 20 doctors in the last one week,” Amodu said. While calling for action amidst the second wave of the pandemic already ravaging the world, he said the second wave was more catastrophic due to non-adherence to non-pharmaceutical measures put in place to curtail the spread of the virus.

“The world is already facing the second wave of the pandemic and this is so overwhelming. The second wave is more catastrophic because a lot of people have gone back to their ways of doing things,” the NMA said. Amodu appealed to patients to refrain from hiding their past medical records to ensure the safety of health workers in the country. He said some doctors contracted the virus as a result of poor knowledge of patient’s medical history and travels. “To our patients, as you come to the hospitals, please oblige us. Wear your face masks, tell us the truth about your past medical condition. Stop holding any information back,” he said.
