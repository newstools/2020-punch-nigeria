Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta Three suspected Internet fraudsters, otherwise known as Yahoo boys, have been arrested for allegedly gang-raping a teenager in Ogun State. The suspects — Tunde Taiwo 22; Damilola Adesina 20; and Adegoke Amos, 21 — were arrested by the police for allegedly gang-raping the 18-year-old in the Ijebu Ode area of the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed these in a statement on Tuesday. Oyeyemi said the suspects were arrested after the victim reported at the Ilese divisional police headquarters, Ijebu-Ode. He added that the teenager, who narrated her ordeal to the police, said while she was going somewhere around the Ita-Ale area of Ilese Ijebu, she was accosted by the three men, who were in a Lexus ES 350. The police spokesman said the victim claimed that the suspects forcefully dragged her into the car and drove to the Rationwa area, where they took turns to rape her at gunpoint. According to the PPRO, on the strength of the report, the DPO Ilese division, SP Yakubu Bala, mobilised detectives and stormed their hideout, where one of them was arrested. He said, “The arrested one led the police to the other two, and they were subsequently arrested. “On interrogation, they confessed to committing the crime and claimed to have believed that the police were no longer working, hence they could do anything they liked, but they were surprised when the police came after them.” Oyeyemi said the state Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, had ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation and prosecution.
