Dayo Ojerinde The Founder and Chief Executive Officer of CribMD, a telemedicine platform, Mr Ifeanyi Ossai, has stressed the importance of telemedicine in transforming the country’s health care system. Ossai, in an interview with our correspondent, urged Nigerians to embrace virtual care and consultation in order to avoid contracting COVID-19. He said, “The year 2020 placed a spotlight on the health care sector through a public health pandemic that has brought the entire world to a standstill. The SARS-COV19 virus which caused the pandemic has been described as a child of its age because of its infectivity and asymptomatic transmission. It will also be remembered as the pandemic which largely outpaced the ability of nations’ health and care systems to contain and manage it. “During the first wave and rapidly rising second wave of the COVID-19 crisis, the masses are urged to stay at home and embrace virtual care as a means of accessing healthcare professionals. Hospitals have ramped up their virtual care programs seemingly overnight, catapulting the industry into the present far sooner than expected. “Telemedicine enables individuals to get quality treatment for non-emergency illnesses and injuries at the comfort of their homes. With virtual consultations, parents can conveniently ensure their child receive the right care, and gain peace of mind. Through telemedicine, healthcare providers can also remotely monitor patient data to identify potential problems.” He added that telemedicine was rapidly redefining health care by helping people talk to doctors anytime from anywhere.
