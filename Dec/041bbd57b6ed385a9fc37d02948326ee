Sodiq Oyeleke The Muslim Rights Concern has faulted the Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Kukah, for criticising the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), over lopsided appointments in his regime. The Muslim group described Kukah’s claim of nepotism in Buhari’s administration as false. MURIC’s director, Ishaq Akintola, made this known on Monday in a press statement titled, ‘Kukah: It is tramadolised religiousity – MURIC’. Kukah had in his New Year message complained of the lopsided appointments in Buhari’s regime, saying, “There is no way any non-Northern Muslim President could have done a fraction of what President Buhari has done by his nepotism and gotten away with it. There would have been a military coup.” But MURIC faulted Kukah’s position, saying that, “This is a most irresponsible pronouncement and we will not allow it to go unchallenged. Kukah’s statement is reckless, inflammatory and unguarded. “It is the most egregious, luciferous and serpentine statement of the year 2020. In particular, we are most disappointed that such a heavily prejudiced and explosive statement is coming from the secretary of Nigeria’s Peace Committee. “Kukah’s allegation of nepotism against PMB holds no water. It further goes to prove that allegations of northern hegemony, caliphate domination, Islamisation and fulanisation are not more than a myth, a mirage, a phantom. “Kukah knows those who engage in favouritism but he has chosen to be a pot calling the kettle black. Certain people are unhappy with a situation whereby they can no longer walk freely into Aso Rock for the low-hanging apples.”
