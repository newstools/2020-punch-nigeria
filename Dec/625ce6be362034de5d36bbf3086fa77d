Kayode Oyero Mr Aliyu Abdullahi, spokesperson for Mrs Aisha Buhari, wife of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), says the First Lady is entitled to a right to privacy. Abdullahi was reacting to the whereabouts of Mrs Buhari who has not been seen in the public of late. He spoke on Tuesday while featuring on Channels Television’s Politics Today programme monitored by The PUNCH. When asked about the whereabouts of Mrs Buhari, the aide said, “The First Lady, although married to the President, nevertheless, she is a citizen of this country and she is entitled to her own right to privacy. That is her right and she does not choose to speak at this particular time.” Abdullahi further noted that there is a huge difference between how Buhari is tackling the insecurity bedeviling the nation and how former President Goodluck Jonathan responded to the same challenge. He said, “Go to North-East, I am from North-East myself. Before the coming of President Muhammadu Buhari, a lot of us can’t visit our home town, bombs were dropping every time but now that is not the case.
