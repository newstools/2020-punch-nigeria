Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The bill seeking the upgrade of Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro into a Federal University of Technology, has passed second reading in the Senate on Thursday. The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, has consequently asked the Senate Committee on Tertiary Institution to carry out further legislative action on the proposed legislation. The same bill was sponsored by Senator Solomon Adeola, chairman of Senate Committee on Finance in the 8th Senate but could not move beyond the first reading stage before the expiration of the 9th National Assembly. The new bill is now being jointly sponsored by Adeola and Senator Tolu Odebiyi, who is representing Ogun West Senatorial District. Leading the debate for the second reading, Adeola said the imperative for the establishment of the university was informed mostly by the expansion and development of the polytechnic established some 38 years ago. He said the institution has ample latitude for massive expansion in terms of space because it is located in a semi urban cum rural setting of Ilaro. He said, “It is worthy of note that the Polytechnic has many infrastructural facilities, which many state owned and privately owned universities cannot boast of. “Ironically those state and newly established federal universities have today been granted National University Commission Accreditation and are running courses as full-fledged universities” he argued.” The second reading of the bill was not opposed by any Senator and was supported by Odebiyi and Senator Bamidele Opeyemi (Ekiti Central).
