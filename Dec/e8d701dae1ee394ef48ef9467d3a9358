Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin The All Progressives Congress chapter in Edo State has called on Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu to leave former APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, out of his legal predicament while urging him to present his certificate as demanded by the court. The state Deputy Charman of the party, Jarret Tenebe, made the assertion in a statement on Monday. The PUNCH had reported that Shaibu warned Oshiomhole not to subvert the will of the people, adding that the former governor should jettison the plan to overturn the victory of Governor Godwin Obaseki at the September 2020 governorship election through the judiciary. Reacting on Monday, Tenebe said there was no time Oshiomhole attempt to subvert the will of the people through the judiciary. “I will describe the deputy governor as a frustrated and confused man who talks from both sides of his mouth as well as seeking for survival. “Oshiomhole believes totally in the judiciary having gotten his stolen mandate through the instrumentality of the courts,” he added. He accused the governor and his deputy of blackmailing the judiciary over their inability to present their certificates but instead resulted to filing frivolous appeals from one court to another. Tenebe added that the new tactics of the governor and his deputy were not only diversionary but also a calculated attempt to drag the hard-earned reputation of the honourable justices into the mud. While noting that he was not supposed to comment on a matter in a court of competent jurisdiction, he, however, said he had to weigh in on the matter to halt the state government from feeding the public with incorrect information.
