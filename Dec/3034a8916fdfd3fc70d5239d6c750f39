Joseph Olaoluwa The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has promoted a cashless policy to optimise its revenue collection and reduce leakages. The Managing Director of FAAN, Captain Rabiu Yadudu, said this during the House Committee on Aviation visit to the agencyâ€™s facilities at the Lagos Airport. Listing some of the steps to push this drive, Yadudu said the agency had suspended the procurement of non-essential items, reduced staff related cost and embarked on a debt recovery drive hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The FAAN boss also disclosed that the new terminal under construction would be ready for use by February 2021. Copyright PUNCH.
