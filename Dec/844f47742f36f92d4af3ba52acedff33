Samson Folarin A former Presidential candidate in the 2019 General Elections, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has said the rotation of the presidency in 2023 would be counter-productive to the polity. In a statement on Tuesday, the civil rights activist said rotation would not foster national unity. He said those who wanted power must build a national consensus behind their programmes. The business mogul, according to the statement, maintained that the envisaged president “should not be based on tribe, religion or region, but on ability to support all-round social and economic development and provide sustainable employment for Nigeria’s massively unemployed hands.” Olawepo-Hashim noted that Nigerians were always ready to vote for a good president. He recalled that without zoning in 1993, the late Chief Moshood Abiola got votes from Kano against Alhaji Bashir Tofa, his main opponent, who hails from that state. The businessman said despite former President Olusegun Obasanjo losing the South-West, in the 1999 elections, he was elected due to votes from other regions. He said, “The talk of zoning of the presidency is, therefore, a false narrative, divisive and inimical to national development. “The notion of it-is-our-turn president makes leaders to escape accountability because when he is questioned, the so-called ethnic base and constituents would gather to say ‘you cannot touch our man because it is our turn. “This   phenomenon is dangerous for   national unity, cohesion and national development, and more importantly, rotating president is a pedestrian diversion from the current subject of devolution and decentralisation of power from the overcentralised centre to the federating states in Nigeria.
