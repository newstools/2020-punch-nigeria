Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt THE family of one Godstime Akugbo, who allegedly died in the custody of the Anti-Cultism Unit of the Rivers State Police Command in 2007, has called on the Rivers State Judicial Panel on Police Brutality and related crimes to prevail on the police to release their son’s corpse for a befitting burial. A petitioner and elder brother of the deceased, Michael Akugbo, stated this when he appeared at the panel’s sitting on Tuesday, even as he demanded the sum of N50m as compensation. Michael said his younger brother was arrested on the allegations that he was in possession of Indian hemp, saying he died in police detention few days after his arrest due to pains from torture. “We want the panel to help compel the Nigeria Police to release my brother’s corpse to us. We also want the perpetrators of the heinous crime against my brother to be brought to justice. Also, we want the Nigeria Police to pay us compensation of N50,” he added.
