Hindi Livinus, Yola The Governor Mai Mala Buni-led National Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress, has approached the state chapter of the African Democratic Congress, in Adamawa state to collapse its party structure into that of the APC. The pioneer Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Nuhu Ribadu; and Mamman Tahir, who is representing the North-East in the APC National caretaker committee, asked Senator Abdulaziz Nyako and other ADC chieftains to join the APC. Ribadu said even though the APC was seeking for capable persons to join its fold ahead of 2023, its special focus on members of ADC to return to the party followed its performance in the 2019 elections wherein it polled over 130,000 votes. He said, “The reason we are asking the ADC members to return to the APC is because they broke out of the APC. Every single member of the ADC was a member of APC. The people of Adamawa are APC and we want everybody to come back. “We lost the last election because over 27 per cent of the votes (130,000) polled by the ADC in the governorship election were votes that could have gone to the APC because the difference between the APC and PDP which won the election was not more than 32,000 votes.” In his remarks, Senator Abduaaziz Nyako, son of former Governor Murtala Nyako, said the ADC would meet to deliberate and take a decision.
