Raphael Ede, Enugu Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State on Wednesday presented N169,845,758,500 Appropriation Bill for 2021 to the State House of Assembly. The Bill tagged, ‘Budget of Recovery and Continued Growth,’ has a capital expenditure outlay N101.1b representing 60 per cent and recurrent expenditure of N68.71b, representing 39 per cent the total budget size. Ugwuanyi said that the budget was 13.8 per cent higher than that of 2020 which stood at N169,557,658,300, before it was later reduced as a result of the outbreak of the COVID-19. According to him, the increment is to enable his administration further improve on human capital as well as infrastructural development in the state, especially in urban areas. Ugwuanyi said, “Enugu state has in the past four years maintained steady economic growth, which is largely because of political stability in the state, stronger and more efficient institutions of governance, improved security of lives and property, provision of critical infrastructure, consistent economic policy and commitment to fiscal discipline.” He maintained that the development had created opportunities for private sector participation in the economic development process of the state. The Speaker of the House, Edward Ubosi, said the House would commence deliberation on the budget to ensure that it was passed before Christmas. Copyright PUNCH.
