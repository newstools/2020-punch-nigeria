Adelani Adepegba,Abuja The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu,  has ordered water-tight security and high visibility patrol in all the states of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory ahead of Christmas and New Year celebrations. The IG gave the directives to all Assistant Inspectors-General of Police and Commissioners of Police in charge of zonal and state commands. According to a statement on Thursday by the Force spokesman, CP Frank Mba, the police boss equally directed the senior officers to deploy intelligence and other operational assets of the Force, particularly on major highways, airports, railway stations, recreational centres, motor parks, places of worship, financial institutions, among others. The statement titled, ‘2020 Christmas and New Year festivities: IG orders 24/7 water-tight security nationwide,’ read in part, “The officers are also to ensure that personnel deployed are adequately supervised for utmost professionalism in the discharge of their duties.” Adamu warned that acts bordering on indiscipline, extortion and intimidation of travellers and other road users would not be condoned. He assured of improved police service delivery and security generally in 2021. Adamu further cautioned Nigerians to take precautionary measures and reduce their exposure to security risks and the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic. “He stressed that citizens should avoid night travels, speeding, stopping on lonely highways and unnecessary flaunting of personal details or wealth on social media. “Citizens are also enjoined to voluntarily adhere to the COVID-19 prevention regulations and protocols to prevent further spread of the virus,” the statement noted.
