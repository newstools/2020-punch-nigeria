Adeyinka Adedipe, Benin One Smart Ofagba, on Thursday, urged the Edo State Judicial Panel of Inquiry to compel the police to compensate his family with N50m for the killing of his father and uncle. He claimed his father, a retired army officer, Samuel Ofagba; his uncle, Mr Abhulimen Ofagba; and his father’s labourer, one Kingsley, were murdered by a Divisional Police Officer identified simply as Aisabor in Usenu Irrua in the Esan Central Local Government Area of Edo State on March 9, 1999 Smart told the panel that Kingsley was accosted by the police officer as he was coming from a burial ceremony and was taken to his father for identification. He explained that an attempt by his father to talk to Kingsley in their dialect in the presence of the police officer resulted in a heated argument, which landed his father, uncle and Kingsley at the station. He said, “My father, uncle and my father’s labourer were kept behind the counter and were told to bail themselves with N40,000 but they were only able to raise N23,000, which the police rejected. “I was told by the Investigative Police Officer to come back the following day to see the DPO, only for me to hear that they had been shot dead and labelled armed robbers by the DPO.” He explained that the police produce a locally-made gun and 10 live cartridges alleged to belong to his late father and uncle. He noted that their bodies were not released to the family for burial. He prayed the panel to compel Aisabor to lead him to where his father was buried so that he could exhume him and give him a befitting burial. He also asked for the prosecution of other officers involved in the killings of his father, uncle and the labourer. The Chairman of the panel, Justice Ada Ehigiamusoe (retd.), said, “This is the collective view of the panel that the said police officer named in the petition, one Mr Aisabor, be summoned before this panel to answer to issues as contained in the petition.”
