Nike Popoola The Managing Director, Access Pension Fund Custodian, Mrs Idu Okwuosa, has said the safety of pension funds is paramount to the operators. She spoke during a virtual media event organised by the Pension Fund Operators Association of Nigeria on ‘Retirement Savings Account transfer window, pension fund investment activities and other penitent issues’ recently. “‘The public should be assured that all pension assets are traded in the name of the Pension Fund Administrators and Pension Fund Custodian, in other words, the investments are made in the PFA/PFC’s name,” she said. She noted that the funds under the Contributory Pension Scheme had continued to grow. According to Okwuosa, all pension investments in the industry are insured. She said there was no chance for anyone to gain access to the funds in the industry. “The returns are not paramount to the National Pension Commission or operators as much as the safety of the funds,” she said. She said the operators would continue to ensure the safety of pension assets for the benefit of all contributors. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
