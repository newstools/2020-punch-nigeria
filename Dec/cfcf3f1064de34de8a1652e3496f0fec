Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Wednesday warned land and property permit approving agencies against engaging in sharp practices. The governor, who noted that the residents of the state and real estate practitioners were complaining about the turnaround time for permit approval, said there was the need for the ministry of physical planning and its agencies to do a better job. Sanwo-Olu stated this at the first Lagos Real Estate Market Place conference. The governor in a statement on Wednesday urged the agencies to be active, adding that the real estate sector could redefine the Gross Domestic Product of the state. He said, “We need to do a better job about physical planning, we need to do a better job of LASBCA and we need to do a quick turnaround in our lands department. People want to have a positive experience.” The governor, who said all land related transactions in Lagos State would be undertaken online from next year, added that that the department of land had built the required capacity for smooth transition to the online platform. “We have started it, we have had this GIS solution for a while, it is a project we are desirous to go live on, once it kicks starts, what it means is that it is a one-stop-shop and with it, you will be able to get your governor’s consent, approval and Certificate of Occupancy on time and all of the documentation for subsequent transactions.” The Special Adviser to Sanwo-Olu on Housing, Toke Benson-Awoyinka, appealed to investors in the real estate sector to team up with the state government to create a home ownership model that would address the deficits in the housing market in the state.
