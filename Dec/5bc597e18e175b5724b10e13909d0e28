Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin The crisis within the Kwara state branch of the All Progressives Congress worsened at the weekend as a faction of the elders’ caucus loyal to the state governor rejected the newly constituted caretaker committee of the party under the leadership of Bashir Bolarinwa, saying that a caretaker committee cannot succeed another one. The party’s elders’ caucus, which comprises Rev. Bunmi Olusona, Senator Oyewo, Senator Ahmed Oleo, Ayinla Folorunsho and Senator Makanjuola Ajadi among others, said this at a press conference in Ilorin on Sunday. The Spokesman of the caucus, Rev Bunmi Olusona, said, “We are aware of the various inglorious moves by those who are only loyal to their personal interests and ambition than the survival of the party, this crop of party supporters wants to take us back to the era of slavery, that we all collectively said O to ge. We refuse to be enslaved again. Copyright PUNCH.
