Segun Adewole A 4-year-old girl, Jessica Mast, has been killed by neighbours who had also ordered her parents to sexually assault her in Lincoln, Missouri. The neighbours, Ethan Mast and his girlfriend Kourtney Aumen had ordered Jessica’s parents, James and Mary Mast, to have their daughter beaten on an allegation that she was demon-possessed. Ethan and Aumen beat the 4-year-old with a wooden spoon and threatened to kill her parents if they tried to stop them. They forced the parents to sexually assault Jessica whom they also beat with a belt before dunking her in a freezing lake. Jessica’s younger brother was not spared from the beating except her youngest sibling, a baby, who was not harmed during the incident.
