Chima Azubuike, Gombe The Jigawa State Governor, Mohammed Abubakar, has said his prudence in managing public funds earned him the nickname “calculator” among residents and citizens of his state. Abubakar said this while speaking to newsmen, alongside his Gombe state counterpart, Inuwa Yahaya, at the Gombe Government House, on Saturday, shortly after attending two weddings at the Bubayero Central Mosque. He said, “Another example is your Governor, he is another calculator. We are from the business world and we value money. So, what we do is to try to do the best for the people. “When you have two projects, you assess and see which one will touch more the life of the people and then you do them. “Secondly, because of my business background you have a connection to know the cost and you do it qualitatively. At the right price or good price and that helps that is why we can do more, with the meager resources we are getting and I think that is also what is happening in Gombe.” While making projections on 2021, Abubakar disclosed that the size of the state budget for 2021 is bigger than 2020, adding that he hopes that things will take shape to allow the actualization of the budget new year’s goals.
