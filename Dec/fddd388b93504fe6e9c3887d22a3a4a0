Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt The Rivers State Police Command has arrested the wife of an ex-supervisory councillor in the Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of the state over the death of her husband. The ex-councillor, Kinikanwo Amadi, aka Skin, was allegedly stabbed to death with a bottle last Thursday following a disagreement with his wife at their residence. A spokesman for the police in the state, Nnamdi Omoni, on Sunday, said the suspect was transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for thorough investigation. Omoni said, “We have arrested the suspect and she is in our custody. Investigations are seriously ongoing for us to ascertain what actually happened.” Meanwhile, a daughter-in-law in the Amadi family, who did not want her name in print, disclosed that the deceased was stabbed with a bottle of beer. She identified the wife as Ihuoma, adding that the suspect before the incident called her husband on the phone for help. She said, “Around past 10pm, Ihuoma called my husband and said that Skin was disturbing her and that my husband should come. It was late, so my husband was a bit reluctant to leave the house. “Around 11pm, a man rushed to our house to inform my husband that his brother was seriously bleeding and he needed help. Before we got there, he was already taken to the hospital.” Copyright PUNCH.
