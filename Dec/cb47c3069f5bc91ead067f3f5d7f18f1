Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Southwest Zonal Coordinator, National Agency for the Control of AIDS, Mr Raheem Mohammed, has bemoaned Nigerians’ unwillingness to go for testing to know their HIV/AIDS status. Ibrahim, who said such remained a great challenge in the fight against the virus, appealed to Nigerians particularly those in the Southwest to go for testing to make the realisation of NACA’s 95-95-95 goal realisable. The zonal coordinator, who spoke in Ado Ekiti during the agency’s familiarisation visit to Ekiti State Action Committee on AIDS, also canvassed strengthening collaboration among neighbouring states to enhance the fight against HIV/AIDS. He said, “A major impediment we have so far is people not willing to come for testing to know their status. No matter how well the country is performing, if people don’t come out to know their status, it is a very serious challenge. “Funding may not be the only challenge, but people’s willingness and awareness to have an interest in coming out to know their HIV status is a great area.  We need to work more on that to get people tested and know their HIV status so that at the end of the day, we will be able to achieve the 95-95-95 target by 2030.” Ibrahim said collaboration among states and people involved in HIV response would help “to strengthen the response and it also helps us to deliver on our mandate. If each state works alone without collaborating with others, other corridors that share borders with those states will suffer inadequacy of either what they do or inadequacy of information.” Copyright PUNCH.
