Strong indications had, however, emerged on Tuesday that pressure was being mounted on Buhari especially by state governors, at a meeting with the President, to shun the House. The Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), had also on Wednesday said the National Assembly lacked the powers to summon the President to speak on security matters, a claim that has generated wide criticisms.
