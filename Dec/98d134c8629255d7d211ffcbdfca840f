The Peoples Democratic Party says it has yet to decide on zoning for 2023 election, saying it would only take the decision after reviewing its performance at the 2019 general elections. The PDP National Chairman, Mr Uche Secondus said this in Abuja on Thursday, while briefing newsmen on Thursday. Asked if PDP was making moves to bring back former President Goodluck Jonathan following the clamour for an Igbo presidency, Secondus said that the decision could only be made after the submission of election appraisal committee’s report. He, however, added that the decision was not for the NWC but for the entirety membership of the party. “I believe that whoever that is interested in 2023, including the former President, has a bright chance because the PDP is a party of all. “Everybody will have that opportunity but in clear terms, we have not taken any decision to give anybody ticket for now. “All over the country, the PDP remains the bride. States under the party’s control rose from 11 to 16, while the party now makes use of internal mechanism to resolve its internal issues,” he said. Secondus said that the party has a methodology of doing things and that would be followed in taking decision for the 2023 elections. “After the general election, we set up a panel to study and appraise our performance and make necessary recommendations. “The Governor of Bauchi state, Alhaji Bala Mohammed is heading the committee and it is still working. “We did the same thing when we lost election in 2015 when we set up Sen. Ike Ekweremadu committee to look into why we lost. It was from that report that the party took action towards 2019. “The same way this time, we must study our last outing before looking ahead. We can’t be talking of zoning when we have not appraised how we faired in the last election. “Moreover, the state of the nation today is such that politics or anything concerning 2023 of three years away should take back stage,” he said.
