Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Task Force on the Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit has said it is set to arraign 60 vehicle owners and drivers before the Mobile Court for violating traffic laws in the state. It was gathered that the violators were arrested in different parts of the state for driving against the traffic, plying the dedicated Bus Rapid Transit lane and causing obstruction on the roads. The Chairman of the agency, Shola Jejeloye, who led the enforcement team, stated that it was worrisome seeing educated motorists and commercial drivers driving against traffic or causing road obstructions across the state. He stated, “Honestly, it is painful that with the high level of enlightenment campaigns and serious warnings by the government, motorists, including private car owners, could still be driving against traffic without fear of crushing innocent passers-by or causing collision with oncoming vehicles. “The agency will keep enhancing the enforcement of the law, which has been checking the excesses of motorists, who drive with impunity on our roads, and I want to thank Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for the donation of additional operational vehicles for the exercise tagged: ‘Anti One-Way’, to further boost traffic enforcement operations by the agency.” According to Jejeloye, the state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has directed that the enforcement operations on motorists driving against traffic, on BRT corridors and causing road obstructions should be intensified in every part of the state. He, however, urged motorists to desist from driving against the traffic and obey the various traffic signs displayed on all roads across the state. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
