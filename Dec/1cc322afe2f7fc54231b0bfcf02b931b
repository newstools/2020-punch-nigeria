Daniels Igoni Yenagoa Some armed men on Friday reportedly attacked the residence of a former militant leader, Eris Paul, alias Ogunboss, in Peremabiri community, Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. It was gathered that the gunmen stormed the coastal community in the early hours of Christmas Day in two speedboats, shooting indiscriminately before setting Ogunboss’ house on fire and destroying many valuables. Sources said no life was lost in the incident but parts of the palatial mansion were razed. The motive of the invaders could not be immediately ascertained but a source in the area said the incident might be connected with disagreement between the ex-militant leader and his adversaries. A close family member said Ogunboss had attended a burial in the community only to learn of the attack. ”He is still in the community doing fine, only that some property were destroyed,” the family member said. The Police Public Relations Officer, Bayelsa State Police Command, Asinim Butswat, confirmed the incident, noting that no casualty was recorded. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
