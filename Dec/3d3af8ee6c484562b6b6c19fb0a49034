Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Commissioner of Police in Bayelsa State, Mr Mike Okoli, has vowed that the trigger-happy policeman, who shot at three women at the Edepie-Etegwe roundabout market in Yenagoa, the state capital city, will be punished severely for his unprofessional conduct. He said the cop, a sergeant, had been in custody since the incident occurred on November 24, 2020, and was undergoing orderly room trial, stressing that proper sanction would be applied on the suspect. The policeman was a member of a patrol team that got stuck in gridlock on the day of the incident and opened fire in a bid to clear the road for their vehicle around the market on the Mbiama-Yenagoa Road. The victims, who were hit by bullets in their legs, have been in hospital since the incident and receiving treatment. Okoli, who was fielding questions from reporters in his office said, “The suspect, a police sergeant, who fired the shots, is in custody and I can assure you that the police due process and severe disciplinary measures will be meted out on him. “His action, just after the end of the #EndSARS protests, was dangerous for the peace-loving Bayelsa State people to hear of police brutality again. “Therefore, no stone will be left unturned in dealing with him. He will face the consequences of his unprofessional action.” The CP added that he had visited the scene of the shooting and the affected women, whose treatment is progressing in hospital.
