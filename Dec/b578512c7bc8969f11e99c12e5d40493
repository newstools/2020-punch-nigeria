Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State House of Assembly on Thursday evening passed the 2021 Appropriation Bill into law. The development came two weeks after Governor Rotimi Akeredolu presented the budget proposal to the Assembly. The House, after committing the budget to the relevant House Committee passed a sum of N174, 873, 305, 525. 32 for the 2021 fiscal year. At the evening plenary, the Chairman of the House Committee on Finance and Appropriation, Sunday Olajide, who presented the report of the committee to the lawmakers, recommended that all the MDAs with high expectation on revenue generation should be given the required support and impetus to achieve their targets. He, however, condemned the attitude of some MDAs for, according to him, not liaising with relevant agencies to access correct information about their budget performance before coming up for their budget defence, saying the act was discouraging. In his remarks, the Speaker of the Assembly, Bamidele Oleyelogun, commended the committee for a job well done, expressing hope that no calamity befalls the nation or the state in other to achieve full implementation of the 2021 budget.
