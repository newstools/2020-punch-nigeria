Friday Olokor, Abuja OVER 100,000 people have been displaced in Anka, Shinkafi and Zurmi in Zamfara State following an upsurge in violence since 2018, an independent international humanitarian organisation, Médecins Sans Frontières, popularly called Doctors without Borders, has said. The MSF which has been working in Nigeria since 1996 is currently working in seven states across Nigeria: Borno, Jigawa, Zamfara, Sokoto, Benue, Ebonyi and Rivers. While expressing concern over what it described as “killings, looting and abduction in Zamfara State”, the MSF said between January and October 2020, its teams had treated a total of 20,260 children for malnutrition in Anka, Shinkafi, Zurmi and Gusau. The Field Communications Manager of MSF for Borno, Nigeria, Stefan Pejovic, gave this figure in a statement entitled: ‘Nigeria: Killings, looting and abductions in Zamfara State’, obtained by The PUNCH in Abuja on Thursday. According to him, many people including Fatima (surname withheld) left their villages after 56 people were killed by bandits in one day. The statement quoted Fatima as saying that about 30 people from their village had already been killed and their belongings constantly being looted. Copyright PUNCH.
