Peter Dada,  Akure The Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, has declared that his administration would soon build a jetty in the riverine area in Ondo South Senatorial District. According to him, the jetty would ease the movement of some equipment needed for bitumen explotation in the state from Apapa in Lagos State. Akeredolu stated this during the Service of Carols and Nine Lessons organised by Ondo State Government, held at the International Centre for Culture and Event Centre,  Akure on Thursday evening. The governor explained that building the jetty port was a commitment that must be made by his administration to see to the successful exploitation of the vast bitumen deposit in the state after several years. He said, “Our efforts at the industrialisation of the state are already yielding fruits. Despite the challenges of today, we are hopeful that several new life-changing projects including the Port Ondo will come into fruition for the turnaround of the economic fortunes of our state.” On Christmas, the governor warned the people of the state to be modest in the celebration of the festival and to be mindful of the coronavirus pandemic. “It is Christmas time and the season of carols, a divine, a unique and colourful period when we as Christians congregate to enjoy inspirational songs in praise and worship of the Lord Jesus Christ. “So we should be modest in our celebration and we should know that COVID-19 has not gone.” Copyright PUNCH.
