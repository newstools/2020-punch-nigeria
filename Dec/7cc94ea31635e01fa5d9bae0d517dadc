Kayode Oyero A former member of the National Assembly, who represented the Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the 8th Senate, Shehu Sani, says the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), is losing his popularity in the northern part of the country due to his inability to solve the country’s security challenges. “Buhari is losing his popularity in the north because of the insecurity. The northerners are most fanatical about Buhari before now but he is losing that because of the insecurity in the region,” the ex-senator said Wednesday on a PUNCH Online interview programme, The Roundtable. Bandits had taken the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, by storm on Friday night and abducted over 300 schoolboys after a gun duel with the police. The President had arrived in the state the same day for a week-long private visit –hours before the abduction took place. Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau, in a recording on Tuesday, had said the abduction of the schoolboys was done in order to discourage people from obtaining western education. But speaking on Wednesday, Sani said it was logistically impossible for Boko Haram which is based in the North-East part of the country to kidnap that number of students from the North-West. He, however, said there must have been a consortium between the bandits and the terrorists.

The former lawmaker added that it was self-defeating for the Buhari regime to claim that Boko Haram has been technically defeated while the terror group continues to wreak mayhem on the citizens daily.
