FRIDAY OLOKOR The Coalition of Northern Groups on Saturday said it had resolved to convoke an all northern security meeting that will be held in Kaduna on December 14 and 15 over the insecurity in the region. This is in relation to the killing of the 43 farmers in Borno State. The CNG said leaders from the region had not shown the capacity to address the situation, as it advised the people from the region to protect themselves against insurgents, bandits, kidnappers and other criminals. CNG spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said in Abuja on Saturday that apart from the 52 core member groups, more than 1,000 affiliate associations across the north would also be in attendance. Meanwhile, elders under the aegis of the Coalition of Nigeria Elders for Peace and Good Governance on Saturday said the warning against coup plotting by the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-General Tukur Buratai, was an imaginary thought aimed at diverting public attention from the failures of the service chiefs. Buratai had while speaking at the decoration of 39 newly promoted Major Generals warned that they should never allow themselves to be dragged into any interest contrary to the sustenance of democracy in the country.
