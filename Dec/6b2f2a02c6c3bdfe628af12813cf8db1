Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Imo State Assembly on Wednesday started a probe of the immediate past Speaker of the House, Collins Chiji, who was earlier impeached by his colleagues over alleged financial recklessness, incompetence and sabotage. He was removed from office in November. The Assembly resolved to audit the financial records of the legislature beginning from June 2019 to November 2020. At the plenary on Wednesday, former minority leader, Ekene Nnodimele, who represents Orsu state constituency, moved a motion for the probe. Nnodimele, who also moved the motion for Chijiâ€™s impeachment in November, said the probe was necessary so as to instill the culture of transparency and accountability in the Assembly. The motion was subjected to a voice vote by the new speaker, Paul Emeziem and a majority of lawmakers voted in favour of the probe. Nnodimele was subsequently named as chairman of the ad hoc committee to carry out the probe with six other lawmakers as members. Other members of the Committee are: Majority leader, Uche Ogbuagu, Emeka Nduka, Eddy Obinna, Frank Ugboma, Dominic Ezerioha and Johnson Duru. The former Speaker who was present during the plenary, was not allowed to contribute to the debate as his request to be given an opportunity to speak was repeatedly turned down. Copyright PUNCH.
