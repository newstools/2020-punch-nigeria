The Lagos State Government has called for more endurance and perseverance in the course of the rehabilitation works going on in the state. This is as the State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, thanked the citizens for their understanding during the partial closure of the Third Mainland Bridge which has now progressed to the Island-bound lane of the bridge, according to a statement emailed to our correspondent. Oladeinde said the government was not oblivious of the plight of the residents, adding that concerted efforts were being channelled to complete the projects in record time to minimise travel time and inconveniences in movement presently experienced within the state. He urged motorists to be a little more patient while driving during the Yuletide, stressing that most impediments were caused largely by unnecessary maneuvering of vehicles. The commissioner also charged traffic management officers to put in their best by working transparently in line with traffic laws. He added that more strategies would be implemented to reduce the inconveniences that have become a part of daily ordeals on the road. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
