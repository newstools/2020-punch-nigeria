Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The Governor of Bayelsa State, Mr Douye Diri, on Wednesday, received the 10 expatriates who were abducted on November 25 following their rescue by security operatives. The foreign sailors were kidnapped from their vessel along the Pennington River in neighbouring Delta State and brought into Bayelsa. A statement by the Governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, identified the victims as three Lebanese, four Indians, two Egyptians and one Cameroonian. It quoted an official of the Department of State Services, who presented the freed vessel workers to Diri at the Government House in Yenagoa, as claiming that it took the concerted effort of security personnel in both Bayelsa and Delta states to rescue them. Diri, who thanked God for the safe return of the victims, said his government was working hard to rid the state of kidnappers. He said, “From when we were informed of the kidnap, the security agencies were on their toes, particularly when we were told that though your kidnap did not take place in Bayelsa, you had been brought into the state. The security operatives went into full gear to locate where you were and to finally ensure your smooth release. “I, therefore, commend the DSS, the police, the army, navy and all other security agencies in Bayelsa that synergised with the state government to ensure zero tolerance for kidnapping in Bayelsa.” He emphasised that his administration was working round the clock to ensure zero tolerance for crime and criminality in the state.
