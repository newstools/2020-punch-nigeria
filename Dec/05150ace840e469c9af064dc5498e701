Adelani Adepegba The United States has removed all visa reciprocity fees for Nigerians seeking visas to the US with effect from December 3, the Federal Government has said. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs disclosed on Saturday that the development was sequel to the removal of excess visa application, processing  and biometric fees for American citizens applying for Nigerian visas. The Donald Trump administration had in 2019 imposed the  reciprocity fee for all approved non-immigrant visa applications by Nigerians. The fee was charged in addition to visa application fees for only applicants who are issued visas. The additional reciprocity fees which ranged from $80 to $303 depending on the class of visa, took effect from August 29 last year. The US Embassy in Nigeria said the reciprocity fees were in response to unsuccessful talks with Nigeria to adjust the fees it charges American applicants. It argued that the total cost for a US citizen to obtain a visa to Nigeria was higher than the total cost for a Nigerian to obtain a comparable visa to the United States. The mission insisted that the reciprocity fee was meant to eliminate the cost difference as required by US laws. Announcing the removal of the reciprocity fee in a statement, the MFA spokesman, Ferdinand Nwonye, said, “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to inform that the United States Government has removed all visa reciprocity fees for Nigerian citizens seeking visas to the United States.
