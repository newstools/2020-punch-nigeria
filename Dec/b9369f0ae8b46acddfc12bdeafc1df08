Kayode Oyero The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has congratulated the Nigerian Army for organising the rescue operation of hundreds of schoolboys abducted from Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State. The President, however, said his regime and the military have a lot of work to do regarding the insecurity in the country. He stated this in two-part short videos posted on his verified Twitter handle, @MBuhari, on Friday morning. He also commended Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari, for being up and doing since the abduction of the schoolboys. Buhari said, “I spoke with the governor. I congratulated him and congratulated the Army that organised the operation, the encirclement of the abductors, and getting the children. The military is well-trained. I think they are sufficiently motivated.” “I am being impressed with the governor, he has been up and doing since it happened. I congratulated him that the children have been released,” he added. Masari had on Thursday night confirmed the release of 344 abducted schoolboys, adding that the boys were at Tsafe, Zamfara State, and would be transported to Kankara on Friday. Masari also said no ransom was paid before the boys were released. Gunmen had invaded the school premises last Friday and abducted over 300 students after a gun duel with the police.

Leader of terror group Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, later released two video footage claiming responsibility for the dastardly act. The Defence Headquarters, however, discredited the claim, insisting the act was carried out by bandits.
