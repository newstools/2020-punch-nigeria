Dennis Naku, Port Harcourt The family of a 31-year old taxi driver, Bright Mark, who was allegedly killed by a cop in February 2018, are demanding N100m as compensation from the Nigeria Police Force. The family also wants the policeman responsible for Mark’s murder prosecuted. According to them, the deceased was shot dead at the popular Rumuokoro Roundabout in the Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State on February 18, 2018. The brother of the deceased, Akachi Mark, during the Monday’s sitting of the Rivers State Judicial Commission of Inquiry on Police Brutality in Port Harcourt said, “We want justice; justice in the sense that the police officer who killed our brother and breadwinner should be brought to book. When the former Commissioner of Police, Zaki, visited our family, he promised to bring the trigger-happy policeman to book. “But nothing has happened till date. We also want financial compensation to the tune of N100m because the Bright was the family’s breadwinner. Today, his wife and daughter, who was only four months old when he was killed, as well as our mother, are languishing in hunger in the village.” But the police counsel, Mrs Mercy Nweke, contended that the petitioner failed to name the specific policeman who killed the deceased. However, Nweke sought for an adjournment to enable the police legal team visit the Rumuokoro Special Area Division, where the incident allegedly occurred Consequently, the retired Justice Chukwunenye Uriri-led panel adjourned the matter till December 2, 2020.
