Daniels Igoni Yenagoa The Bayelsa State Government has expressed hope that its airport in Yenagoa would open for commercial flights in January. The government equally cautioned those sponsoring unfounded rumours and negative impressions about the state-owned airport, especially in the social media, stressing that it amounted to demarketing Bayelsa. The Deputy Governor, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, gave the warning during a meeting with the airport management and service providers in his office at the Government House, Yenagoa, on Wednesday. Ewhrudjakpo in a statement by his media aide, Doubara Atasi, said workers must desist from activities that were inimical to the rules of their employment as government would not hesitate to invoke appropriate sanctions against anyone found culpable. He said the state government was making last ditch efforts to acquire the operational licence for the commencement of commercial flights by the end of January 2021. The deputy governor expressed optimism that the state government would do everything within its reach to achieve the new target to enable Bayelsans and the general public enjoy the benefits associated with the airport. Ewhrudjakpo warned, â€œYou have been in that airport for about a year or even more and the airport is not operating. Ordinarily, I think that should concern you and every one of us instead of writing petitions. He said facilities already provided by the state government at the airport were relatively better than existing ones in most airports in the country. In her remarks, the Manager, Bayelsa International Airport, Elizabeth Daitare-Akpama, described the issue of petition writing and wrangling in the airport as worrisome and counter-productive.
